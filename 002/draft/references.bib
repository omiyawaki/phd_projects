  abstract = {A convective cloud feedback on extratropical surface temperatures is identified in a zonally averaged two-level atmospheric model. The model contains simplified parametrizations for convection, precipitation, and clouds, and a long-wave radiation scheme that explicitly depends on carbon dioxide, water vapour, and cloud fraction. The convective cloud feedback occurs if the extratropical surface temperature is increased enough to initiate strong atmospheric convection. This results in a change from low to high clouds and from negative to neutral or positive cloud radiative forcing, which further warms the surface and leads to more convection. This positive feedback activates as the CO2 concentration is increased and leads to a climate solution with high boundary-layer temperatures, convection at mid and high latitudes, and an Equator to Pole temperature difference that is reduced by 8\textendash 10 \textdegree C. The reduction in Equator to Pole temperature difference is due to changes in high-latitude local heat balance and occurs despite decreased meridional heat transport. The convective cloud feedback also leads to multiple equilibria and hysteresis with respect to CO2 and other model variables, although these results may be due to the simplicity of the model. The possible connection of the behaviour of the model at high CO2 with equable climates is considered. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {It is argued that deep atmospheric convection might occur during winter in ice-free high-latitude oceans, and that the surface radiative warming effects of the clouds and water vapor associated with this winter convection could keep high-latitude oceans ice-free through polar night. In such an ice-free high-latitude ocean the annual-mean SST would be much higher and the seasonal cycle would be dramatically reduced - making potential implications for equable climates manifest. The constraints that atmospheric heat transport, ocean heat transport, and CO2 concentration place on this mechanism are established. These ideas are investigated using the NCAR column model, which has state-of-the-art atmospheric physics parameterizations, high vertical resolution, a full seasonal cycle, a thermodynamic sea ice model, and a mixed layer ocean.},

  abstract = {Geological and geochemical evidence can be interpreted as indicating strong hysteresis in global climate during the Neoproterozoic glacial events ({$\sim$}630 Ma and {$\sim$}715 Ma). Standard climate theory only allows such strong hysteresis if global climate enters a fully-glaciated ``Snowball'' state. However, the survival of photosynthetic, eukaryotic, marine species through these glaciations may indicate that there were large areas of open ocean. A previously-proposed ``Slushball'' model for Neoproterozoic glaciations could easily explain the survival of these organisms because it has open ocean throughout the tropics, but there is only a small amount of hysteresis associated with the Slushball state. In this paper a new state of global climate, the ``Jormungand'' state, is proposed. In this state the ocean is very nearly globally ice-covered, but a very small strip of the tropical ocean remains ice-free. The low ice latitude of the Jormungand state is a consequence of the low albedo of snow-free (bare) sea ice. If the ice latitude propagates into the subtropical desert zone, it can stabilize without collapsing to the equator because subtropical ice-covered regions have a relatively low top-of-atmosphere albedo as a result of the exposure of bare sea ice and relatively lower cloud cover. Moreover, there is strong hysteresis associated with the Jormungand state as greenhouse gas levels are varied because of the high albedo contrast between regions of bare and snow covered sea ice. The Jormungand state is illustrated here in two different atmospheric global climate models and in the Budyko-Sellers model. By offering a scenario that could explain both strong hysteresis in global climate and the survival of life, the Jormungand state represents a potential model for Neoproterozoic glaciations, although further study of this issue is needed.},

  abstract = {Applying the conservation of energy principle to the incoming solar radiation and to the long-wave radiation, a heating mechanism of the atmosphere is introduced. A simplified emission spectrum of the atmosphere with one transparent region is used. The surface of the earth and a cloud layer are considered as black bodies.A simplified model of the atmosphere containing the coupling between dynamical and thermodynamical processes is presented. The equations that give the temperature, the excess of radiation and the mean zonal wind for each day of the year are derived. The temperature is given by a second order differential equation that can readily be solved. The zonal wind and the excess of radiation are explicit functions of the temperature.If in the computations we postulate that the addition of energy by processes other than radiation is a constant, the solution agrees remarkably well with the observed values, except in the months of May, June and July.It is shown that using only meridional turbulent diffusion transport of heat by large eddies, the required transport is accomplished. The theoretical solution requires a transport with the following exchange coefficients: 5 \texttimes{} 1010 cm2 per sec in February and in March, 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 in October, 4 \texttimes{} 1010 in January, 3.5 \texttimes{} 1010 in November, 3 \texttimes{} 1010 in September and in December, 2 \texttimes{} 1010 in April, 0.25 \texttimes{} 1010 in August, and zero in May, June and July. There are two maxima of the value of the exchange coefficient: one in February and the other in October. The order of magnitude of the values of the exchange coefficient of our solution is in complete agreement with the value corresponding to the migratory cyclones and anticyclones of the middle latitudes, treated as turbulent eddies, which is equal to 5 \texttimes{} 1010.The theoretical solution correctly gives the position and strength of the jet stream, except in May, June and July. Therefore we can conclude that, except in these months, the mean daily circulation is mainly a result of the transfer of energy by radiation processes and the turbulent meridional transport of heat by the migratory cyclones and anticyclones.},

  abstract = {The surface of the Arctic Ocean in summer is a mix of sea ice and water in both leads and melt ponds. Here we use data collected at multiple sites during the year-long experiment to study the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) to develop a bulk turbulent flux algorithm for predicting the surface fluxes of momentum and sensible and latent heat over the Arctic Ocean during summer from readily measured or modelled quantities. The distinctive aerodynamic feature of summer sea ice is that the leads and melt ponds create vertical ice faces that the wind can push against; momentum transfer to the surface is thus enhanced through form drag. In effect, summer sea ice behaves aerodynamically like the marginal ice zone, which is another surface that consists of sea ice and water. In our bulk flux algorithm, we therefore combine our SHEBA measurements of the neutral-stability drag coefficient at a reference height of 10 m, \$\textbackslash hboxC\_\textbackslash rm DN10\$, with similar measurements from marginal ice zones that have been reported in the literature to create a unified parametrization for \$\textbackslash hboxC\_\textbackslash rm DN10\$ for summer sea ice and for any marginal ice zone. This parametrization predicts \$\textbackslash hboxC\_\textbackslash rm DN10\$ from a second-order polynomial in ice concentration. Our bulk flux algorithm also includes expressions for the roughness lengths for temperature and humidity, introduces new profile stratification corrections for stable stratification, and effectively eliminates the singularities that often occur in iterative flux algorithms for very light winds. In summary, this new algorithm seems capable of estimating the friction velocity u* (a surrogate for the momentum flux) over summer sea ice with an absolute accuracy of 0.02\textendash 0.03 m s-1; the sensible heat flux, with an accuracy of about 6 W m-2; and the latent heat flux, with an accuracy of 3.5 W m-2.

  abstract = {An atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) is forced with patterns of observed sea surface temperature (SST) change and those output from atmosphere\textendash ocean GCM (AOGCM) climate change simulations to demonstrate a strong dependence of climate feedback on the spatial structure of surface temperature change. Cloud and lapse rate feedbacks are found to vary the most, depending strongly on the pattern of tropical Pacific SST change. When warming is focused in the southeast tropical Pacific\textemdash a region of climatological subsidence and extensive marine low cloud cover\textemdash warming reduces the lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and low cloud cover but is largely trapped under an inversion and hence has little remote effect. The net result is a relatively weak negative lapse rate feedback and a large positive cloud feedback. In contrast, when warming is weak in the southeast tropical Pacific and enhanced in the west tropical Pacific\textemdash a strong convective region\textemdash warming is efficiently transported throughout the free troposphere. The increased atmospheric stability results in a strong negative lapse rate feedback and increases the LTS in low cloud regions, resulting in a low cloud feedback of weak magnitude.

In a 2000 km-wide region in the central-eastern Pacific ITCZ, vertical motions import MSE, implying a negative gross moist stability. Horizontal MSE advection is negative and of similar magnitude to vertical MSE advection in rainy regions. Geographic differences in export of MSE by the vertical circulation are primarily due to differences in the shape of the vertical motion profile. In the west Pacific warm pool rainy regions, mean horizontal convergence extends up to 300 mb, while in parts of the Pacific ITCZ where meridional SST gradients are strong, the vertical motion profile is bottom-heavy, with convergence below 800 mb and divergence above. On daily timescales, the mode of vertical motion variability has little dependence on precipitation rate and is consistent with observed regional differences in the vertical structure of TRMM PR reflectivities.},

In particular an examination is undertaken of the applicability to mid-latitude situations of the convective adjustment scheme proposed by Betts (1986), which was based primarily on tropical data. It is shown that, given a proper set for the adjustable parameters derived from the observations, the deep-convection reference profile of Betts characterizes well the convectively adjusted atmosphere of the extra-tropical continental environment. In comparison with the reference profile determined by Betts and Miller (1986), the temperature structure derived from the present data-set is found to be even more unstable below melting level. In addition the humidity profile exhibits some distinctive physical characteristics.},

  abstract = {The role of eddy fluxes in the general circulation is often approached by treating eddies as (macro)turbulence. In this approach, the eddies act to diffuse certain quasi-conservative quantities, such as potential vorticity (PV), along isentropic surfaces in the free atmosphere. The eddy fluxes are determined primarily by the eddy diffusivities and are necessarily down-gradient of the basic state PV field. Support for the (macro)turbulence approach stems from the fact that the eddy fluxes of PV in the free atmosphere are generally down-gradient in the long-term mean. Here we call attention to a pronounced and significant region of up-gradient eddy PV fluxes on the poleward flank of the jet core in both hemispheres. The region of up-gradient (i.e., notionally ``antidiffusive'') eddy PV fluxes is most pronounced during the winter and spring seasons and partially contradicts the turbulence approach described above. Analyses of the PV variance (potential enstrophy) budget suggest that the up-gradient PV fluxes represent local wave decay and are maintained by poleward fluxes of PV variance. Finite-amplitude effects thus represent leading order contributions to the PV variance budget, whereas dissipation is only of secondary importance locally. The appearance of up-gradient PV fluxes in the long-term mean is associated with the poleward shift of the jet\textemdash and thus the region of wave decay relative to wave growth\textemdash following wave-breaking events.},

Despite state-of-the-art climate models capturing the rapid nature of Arctic climate change, termed Arctic amplification, they significantly disagree on its magnitude. Using a regional, process-oriented surface energy budget analysis, we argue that differences in seasonal energy exchanges in sea ice retreat regions via increased absorption and storage of sunlight in summer and increased upward surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter contribute to the inter-model spread. Models able to more widely disperse energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more, suggesting that differences in the local Arctic atmospheric circulation response contribute to the inter-model spread. We find that the principle mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in Arctic amplification operate locally on regional scales, requiring an improved understanding of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions to reduce the spread.},

However, evaporation in the Arctic is still associated with large uncertainties. The Boisvert et al. (2013) moisture flux scheme (BMF13) is based on application of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data, which produces high-quality, global, daily atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles even in the presence of clouds. Comparing the results of BMF13 against the ERA-Interim reanalysis, we found differences up to 55 W m-2 in the surface latent heat flux in the Beaufort-East Siberian Seas (BESS). We found out that the quality of the input data for the BMF13 and ERA-Interim flux schemes was the main cause for the differences. Differences in the input data sets cause moisture flux estimates to differ up to 1.6 \texttimes{} 10-2 g m-2 s-1 (40 W m-2 latent heat flux) in the BESS region, when both data sets were applied to the BMF13 scheme. Thus, the input data sets, AIRS version 6 and ERA-Interim reanalysis, were compared with a variety of in situ data. In skin temperature ERA-Interim had twice as large an error as AIRS version 6, but smaller errors in air specific humidity. The results suggested that AIRS data and the BMF13 scheme are a good option to estimate the moisture flux in the Arctic. However, the differences detected demonstrate a need for more in situ measurements of air temperature and humidity in the Arctic.},

By analyzing radiative\textendash convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but find themselves in a more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the anvil cloud fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the anvil cloud fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes the observed monthly deseasonalized and detrended variability of the tropical radiation budget and suggests that variations of the lower-tropospheric stability and of the spatial organization of deep convection both strongly contribute to this variability. Satellite observations show that on average over the tropical belt, when deep convection is more aggregated, the free troposphere is drier, the deep convective cloud coverage is less extensive, and the emission of heat to space is increased; an enhanced aggregation of deep convection is thus associated with a radiative cooling of the tropics. An increase of the tropical-mean lower-tropospheric stability is also coincident with a radiative cooling of the tropics, primarily because it is associated with more marine low clouds and an enhanced reflection of solar radiation, although the free-tropospheric drying also contributes to the cooling. The contributions of convective aggregation and lower-tropospheric stability to the modulation of the radiation budget are complementary, largely independent of each other, and equally strong. Together, they account for more than sixty percent of the variance of the tropical radiation budget. Satellite observations are thus consistent with the suggestion from modeling studies that the spatial organization of deep convection substantially influences the radiative balance of the Earth. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that control convective organization and lower-tropospheric stability variations, and the need to monitor their changes as the climate warms.},

These quantitative theories can explain shifts in the zonal mean, but often have limited relevance for regional climate shifts, such as a period of enhanced precipitation over Saharan Africa during the mid-Holocene. Here we present a theory for regional tropical rainfall shifts that utilizes both zonal and meridional energy fluxes. We first identify a qualitative link between zonal and meridional energy fluxes and rainfall variations associated with the seasonal cycle and the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation. We then develop a quantitative theory based on these fluxes that relates atmospheric energy transport to tropical rainfall. When applied to the orbital configuration of the mid-Holocene, our theory predicts continental rainfall shifts over Africa and Southeast Asia that are consistent with complex model simulations. However, the predicted rainfall over the Sahara is not sufficient to sustain vegetation at a level seen in the palaeo-record, which instead requires an additional large energy source such as that due to reductions in Saharan surface albedo. We thus conclude that additional feedbacks, such as those involving changes in vegetation or soil type, are required to explain changes in rainfall over Africa during the mid-Holocene.},

All of the planets orbit nearby M-stars and are likely tidally locked in 1:1 spin\textendash orbit states, which motivates the consideration of the effects that tidal locking might have on planetary habitability. On Earth, periods of global glaciation (snowballs) may have been essential for habitability and remote signs of life (biosignatures) because they are correlated with increases in the complexity of life and in the atmospheric oxygen concentration. In this paper, we investigate the snowball bifurcation (sudden onset of global glaciation) on tidally locked planets using both an energy balance model and an intermediate-complexity global climate model. We show that tidally locked planets are unlikely to exhibit a snowball bifurcation as a direct result of the spatial pattern of insolation they receive. Instead, they will smoothly transition from partial to complete ice coverage and back. A major implication of this work is that tidally locked planets with an active carbon cycle should not be found in a snowball state. Moreover, this work implies that tidally locked planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone with low CO2 outgassing fluxes will equilibrate with a small unglaciated substellar region rather than cycling between warm and snowball states. More work is needed to determine how the lack of a snowball bifurcation might affect the development of life on a tidally locked planet.},

This fast response demonstrates that the weakening could not be solely due to the much slower increase in surface temperature.

In this study, a global climate model is first evaluated by comparing its CAPE and CIN with reanalysis data, and then their future changes and the underlying causes are examined. The climate model reasonably captures the present-day CAPE and CIN patterns seen in the reanalysis, and projects increased CAPE almost everywhere and stronger CIN over most land under global warming. Over land, the cases or times with medium to strong CAPE or CIN would increase while cases with weak CAPE or CIN would decrease, leading to an overall strengthening in their mean values. These projected changes are confirmed by convection-permitting 4-km model simulations over the United States. The CAPE increase results mainly from increased low-level specific humidity, which leads to more latent heating and buoyancy for a lifted parcel above the level of free convection (LFC) and also a higher level of neutral buoyancy. The enhanced CIN over most land results mainly from reduced low-level relative humidity (RH), which leads to a higher lifting condensation level and a higher LFC and thus more negative buoyancy. Over tropical oceans, the near-surface RH increases slightly, leading to slight weakening of CIN. Over the subtropical eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, the impact of reduced low-level atmospheric lapse rates overshadows the effect of increased specific humidity, leading to decreased CAPE.},

Based on simulations with the Community Climate Model Version 3 (CCM3), it is shown that the summertime weakening in the SST gradient weakens the monsoon circulation, resulting in less monsoon rainfall over India and excess rainfall in sub-Saharan Africa. The observed trend in SST is decomposed into a hypothetical uniform warming and a reduction in the meridional gradient. The uniform warming of the tropical Indian Ocean in the authors' simulations increases the Indian summer monsoon rainfall by 1\textendash 2 mm day\textsuperscript{-1}, which is opposed by a larger drying tendency due to the weakening of the SST gradient. The net effect is to decrease the Indian monsoon rainfall, while preventing the sub-Saharan region from becoming too dry. Published coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere model simulations are used to describe the competing effects of the anthropogenic radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases and the anthropogenic South Asian aerosols on the observed SST gradient and the monsoon rainfall.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The response of a general circulation model (GCM) to global perturbations in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is examined. The feedback strengths in the model are diagnosed by the response of top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes determined after substitution of fields from the ``perturbed'' climate into the ``control.'' Total feedback is divided into terms due to water vapour, lapse rate, surface temperature, and clouds (in turn analysed in terms of cloud amount, height and types). The ``standard experiment'' prescribes a globally uniform SST perturbation with fixed soil moisture. Four additional experiments vary the number of model vertical levels, the pattern of SST changes, the convection scheme, and the soil moisture. The SST pattern change chosen follows that of an equilibrium 2\texttimes CO2 experiment, which shows polar amplification of the surface warming. Variations in the clear sky sensitivity of the model are shown to depend primarily on changes in the long wave response due to competing (positive) water vapor and (generally negative) lapse rate feedbacks. Results here indicate that these feedbacks may be very different for differing experimental boundary conditions. The long wave feedback due to cloud amount changes is negative in all experiments, due to a very consistent decrease in high and middle cloud fractions. Conversely, cloud height feedback is positive due to a general increase in the altitude of (particularly high) cloud. Cloud height feedback is very sensitive to the choice of the convection scheme and to the change in vertical resolution. Greatest changes in the strength of the short wave cloud feedback results from modifications to the soil moisture specification and the convection scheme. The results here indicate that large differences in cloud feedback may be diagnosed from a single model, even without changes being made to the cloud parametrization. The value of the sensitivity can thus be expected to be a function not only of the physical parametrizations chosen for the model (e.g. the penetrative convection scheme), but also of the details of the manner in which the experiment was performed (e.g. SST and soil moisture specifications). The TOA radiation perturbation analysis method proves to be a powerful technique for diagnosing and understanding the physical processes responsible for the range in climate sensitivity found between the experiments.},

Temperature profiles are determined by a competition between stabilization by atmospheric shortwave absorption and advective heat flux convergence, and destabilization by surface shortwave absorption. We derive analytic expressions for temperature profiles, assuming power law atmospheric heating profiles as a function of pressure and two-stream windowed-gray longwave radiative transfer. We discuss example profiles with and without an atmospheric window and show that the sensitivity of surface temperature to forcing depends on the nature of the forcing, with greatest sensitivity to radiative forcing by increased optical thickness and least sensitivity to increased atmospheric heat transport. These differences in sensitivity of surface temperature to forcing can be explained in terms of a forcing-dependent lapse-rate feedback.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The seasonal cycle of the heating of the atmosphere is divided into a component due to direct solar absorption in the atmosphere and a component due to the flux of energy from the surface to the atmosphere via latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes. Both observations and coupled climate models are analyzed. The vast majority of the seasonal heating of the northern extratropics (78\% in the observations and 67\% in the model average) is due to atmospheric shortwave absorption. In the southern extratropics, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is entirely due to atmospheric shortwave absorption in both the observations and the models, and the surface heat flux opposes the seasonal heating of the atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric temperature is surface amplified in the northern extratropics and nearly barotropic in the Southern Hemisphere; in both cases, the vertical profile of temperature reflects the source of the seasonal heating.             In the northern extratropics, the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heating over land differs markedly from that over the ocean. Over the land, the surface energy fluxes complement the driving absorbed shortwave flux; over the ocean, they oppose the absorbed shortwave flux. This gives rise to large seasonal differences in the temperature of the atmosphere over land and ocean. Downgradient temperature advection by the mean westerly winds damps the seasonal cycle of heating of the atmosphere over the land and amplifies it over the ocean. The seasonal cycle in the zonal energy transport is 4.1 PW.             Finally, the authors examine the change in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heating in 11 models from phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) due to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from preindustrial concentrations. The seasonal heating of the troposphere is everywhere enhanced by increased shortwave absorption by water vapor; it is reduced where sea ice has been replaced by ocean, which increases the effective heat storage reservoir of the climate system and thereby reduces the seasonal magnitude of energy fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. As a result, the seasonal amplitude of temperature increases in the upper troposphere (where atmospheric shortwave absorption increases) and decreases at the surface (where the ice melts).},

At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), adjusted radiances from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are used, while in the atmosphere the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\textendash National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\textendash NCAR) reanalysis and 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) estimates are used. The net upward surface flux (FS) over ocean is derived as the residual of the TOA and atmospheric energy budgets, and is compared with direct calculations of ocean heat content (OE) and its tendency ({$\delta$}OE/{$\delta$}t) from several ocean temperature datasets. Over land, FS from a stand-alone simulation of the Community Land Model forced by observed fields is used. A depiction of the full energy budget based on ERBE fluxes from 1985 to 1989 and CERES fluxes from 2000 to 2004 is constructed that matches estimates of the global, global ocean, and global land imbalances. In addition, the annual cycle of the energy budget during both periods is examined and compared with ocean heat content changes.             The near balance between the net TOA radiation (RT) and FS over ocean and thus with OE, and between RT and atmospheric total energy divergence over land, are documented both in the mean and for the annual cycle. However, there is an annual mean transport of energy by the atmosphere from ocean to land regions of 2.2 {$\pm$} 0.1 PW (1 PW = 1015 W) primarily in the northern winter when the transport exceeds 5 PW. The global albedo is dominated by a semiannual cycle over the oceans, but combines with the large annual cycle in solar insolation to produce a peak in absorbed solar and net radiation in February, somewhat after the perihelion, and with the net radiation 4.3 PW higher than the annual mean, as it is enhanced by the annual cycle of outgoing longwave radiation that is dominated by land regions. In situ estimates of the annual variation of OE are found to be unrealistically large. Challenges in diagnosing the interannual variability in the energy budget and its relationship to climate change are identified in the context of the episodic and inconsistent nature of the observations.},

At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), adjusted radiances from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are used along with estimates of energy storage and transport from two global reanalysis datasets for the atmosphere. Three ocean temperature datasets are used to assess changes in the ocean heat content (OE) and their relationship to the net upward surface energy flux over ocean (FoS), which is derived from the residual of the TOA and atmospheric energy budgets. The surface flux over land is from a stand-alone simulation of the Community Land Model forced by observed fields.             In the extratropics, absorbed solar radiation (ASR) achieves a maximum in summer with peak values near the solstices. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) maxima also occur in summer but lag ASR by 1\textendash 2 months, consistent with temperature maxima over land. In the tropics, however, OLR relates to high cloud variations and peaks late in the dry monsoon season, while the OLR minima in summer coincide with deep convection in the monsoon trough at the height of the rainy season. Most of the difference between the TOA radiation and atmospheric energy storage tendency is made up by a large heat flux into the ocean in summer and out of the ocean in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the transport of energy from ocean to land regions is substantial in winter, and modest in summer. In the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, land - ocean differences play only a small role and the main energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean is poleward. There is reasonably good agreement between FoS and observed changes in OE, except for south of 40\textdegree S, where differences among several ocean datasets point to that region as the main source of errors in achieving an overall energy balance. The winter hemisphere atmospheric circulation is the dominant contributor to poleward energy transports outside of the tropics [6\textendash 7 PW (1 petawatt = 1015 W)], with summer transports being relatively weak ({$\sim$}3 PW)\textemdash slightly more in the Southern Hemisphere and slightly less in the Northern Hemisphere. Ocean transports outside of the tropics are found to be small (\&lt;2 PW) for all months. Strong cross-equatorial heat transports in the ocean of up to 5 PW exhibit a large annual cycle in phase with poleward atmospheric transports of the winter hemisphere.},

The latter lapse rate feedback is subject, at high latitudes, to a myriad of local and remote influences whose relative contributions remain unquantified. The distinct controls on the high-latitude lapse rate feedback are here partitioned into ``upper'' and ``lower'' contributions originating above and below a characteristic climatological isentropic surface that separates the high-latitude lower troposphere from the rest of the atmosphere. This decomposition clarifies how the positive high-latitude lapse rate feedback over polar oceans arises primarily as an atmospheric response to local sea ice loss and is reduced in subpolar latitudes by an increase in poleward atmospheric energy transport. The separation of the locally driven component of the high-latitude lapse rate feedback further reveals how it and the sea-ice albedo feedback together dominate Arctic amplification as a coupled mechanism operating across the seasonal cycle.},

  abstract = {The comparison of trends in various climate indices in observations and models is of fundamental importance for judging the credibility of climate projections. Tropical tropospheric temperature trends have attracted particular attention as this comparison may suggest a model deficiency. One can think of this problem as composed of two parts: one focused on tropical surface temperature trends and the associated issues related to forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake and a second part focusing on connections between surface and tropospheric temperatures and the vertical profile of trends in temperature. Here we focus on the atmospheric component of the problem. We show that two ensembles of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory HiRAM model runs (similar results are shown for National Center for Atmospheric Research's CAM4 model) with different commonly used prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), namely, the HadISST1 and ``Hurrell'' data sets, have a difference in upper tropical tropospheric temperature trends ({$\sim$}0.1 K/decade at 300 hPa for the period 1984\textendash 2008) that is about a factor 3 larger than expected from moist adiabatic scaling of the tropical average SST trend difference. We show that this surprisingly large discrepancy in temperature trends is a consequence of SST trend differences being largest in regions of deep convection. Further, trends, and the degree of agreement with observations, not only depend on SST data set and the particular atmospheric temperature data set but also on the period chosen for comparison. Due to the large impact on atmospheric temperatures, these systematic uncertainties in SSTs need to be resolved before the fidelity of climate models' tropical temperature trend profiles can be assessed.},

The key elements of the model physics are gray radiative transfer, in which water vapor and other constituents have no effect on radiative fluxes, a simple diffusive boundary layer with prognostic depth, and a mixed layer aquaplanet surface boundary condition. This GCM can be integrated stably without a convection parameterization, with large-scale condensation only, and this study focuses on this simplest version of the model. These simplifications provide a useful framework in which to focus on the interplay between latent heat release and large-scale dynamics.

In this study, using the dropsonde observations, we evaluate the performance of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2) in representing the Antarctic boundary layer thermodynamic structure. Results show that MERRA2 has a good overall representation of the Antarctic surface stability and correctly predicts 82\% of the SBIs. However, an underprediction of less stable boundary layer occurrence, especially over the elevated East Antarctic plateau, is favored during conditions of increased lower tropospheric stability associated with model dynamics, indicating difficulty in parameterizing turbulence in very stable boundary layers. In addition, a lower tropospheric cool bias (first model level and above) is observed in the MERRA2 reanalysis, especially over West Antarctica, which amplifies in the boundary layer during mixed conditions. The near-surface cold bias is most pronounced when the model fails to predict mixed layers over West Antarctica and is expected to negatively impact the representation of surface energy budget and melt processes.},

Here the authors present global aquaplanet simulations with a low-resolution, nonhydrostatic model free of convective parameterization, and describe the effect on the global climate of very large rescaling of the vertical acceleration. As the convection expands to resolved scales, a deepening of the troposphere, a weakening of the Hadley cell, and a moistening of the lower troposphere is found, compared to solutions in which the moist convection is essentially hydrostatic. The growth rate of convective instability is reduced and the convective life cycle is lengthened relative to synoptic phenomena.

This review deals with the consequences of abandoning the TA, based on evidence from numerical and theoretical studies and laboratory and field experiments. The phenomena most affected by the TA include mesoscale flows (Ekman spirals, deep convection, and equatorial jets) and internal waves. Abandoning the TA produces a tilt in convective plumes, produces a dependence on wind direction in Ekman spirals, and gives rise to a plethora of changes in internal wave behavior in weakly stratified layers, such as the existence of trapped short low-frequency waves, and a poleward extension of their habitat. In the astrophysical context of stars and gas giant planets, the TA affects the rate of tidal dissipation and also the patterns of thermal convection.},

  abstract = {The circulation of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical troposphere has changed over recent decades, with marked decreases in extratropical cyclone activity and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in summer and increases in the fraction of precipitation that is convective in all seasons. Decreasing EKE in summer is partly explained by a weakening meridional temperature gradient, but changes in vertical temperature gradients and increasing moisture also affect the mean available potential energy (MAPE), which is the energetic reservoir from which extratropical cyclones draw. Furthermore, the relation of changes in mean thermal structure and moisture to changes in convection associated with extratropical cyclones is poorly understood. Here we calculate trends in MAPE for the Northern extratropics in summer over the years 1979\textendash 2017, and we decompose MAPE into both convective and nonconvective components. Nonconvective MAPE decreased over this period, consistent with decreases in EKE and extratropical cyclone activity, but convective MAPE increased, implying an increase in the energy available to convection. Calculations with idealized atmospheres indicate that nonconvective and convective MAPE both increase with increasing mean surface temperature and decrease with decreasing meridional surface temperature gradient, but convective MAPE is relatively more sensitive to the increase in mean surface temperature. These results connect changes in the atmospheric mean state with changes in both large-scale and convective circulations, and they suggest that extratropical cyclones can weaken even as their associated convection becomes more energetic.},

While Antarctic surface elevation has been implicated in promoting a weaker Antarctic lapse rate feedback, the mechanisms in which elevation impacts the lapse rate feedback are still unclear. Here we suggest that weaker Antarctic warming under CO2 forcing stems from shallower, less intense climatological inversions due to limited atmospheric heat transport above the ice sheet elevation and elevation-induced katabatic winds. In slab ocean model experiments with flattened Antarctic topography, stronger climatological inversions support a stronger lapse rate feedback and annual mean Antarctic warming comparable to the Arctic under CO2 doubling. Unlike the Arctic, seasonality in warming over flat Antarctica is mainly driven by a negative shortwave cloud feedback, which exclusively dampens summer warming, with a smaller contribution from the winter-enhanced lapse rate feedback.},

  abstract = {In this study, the phase-locking of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a coupled model with different physical parameter values is investigated. It is found that there is a dramatic change in ENSO phase-locking in response to a slight change in the Tokioka parameter, which is a minimum entrainment rate threshold in the cumulus parameterization. With a smaller Tokioka parameter, the model simulates ENSO peak in the boreal summer season rather than in the winter season as observed. It is revealed that the differences in climatological zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient and its associated mean state changes are crucial to determine the phase-locking of ENSO. In the simulations with smaller Tokioka parameter values, climatological zonal SST gradient during the boreal summer is excessively large, because the zonally-asymmetric SST change (i.e., SST increase is relatively smaller over the eastern Pacific) is maximum during the boreal summer when the eastern Pacific SST is the coolest of the year. The enhanced climatological zonal SST gradient in boreal summer reduces the convection over the eastern Pacific, which leads to a weakening of air\textendash sea coupling strength. The minimum coupling strength during summer prevents SST anomalies from further development in the following season, which favors SST maximum during summer. In addition, enhanced zonal SST gradient and resultant thermocline shoaling over the eastern Pacific lead to excessive zonal advective feedback and thermocline feedback. Atmospheric damping is also weakened during boreal summer season. These changes due to feedback processes allow an excessive development of SST anomalies during the summer time, and lead to a summer peak of ENSO. The importance of basic state change for the ENSO phase-locking is also validated in a multi-model framework using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 archive. It is found that several of the climate models have the same problem in producing a summer peak of ENSO. Consistent with the simulations with different physical parameter values, these models have minimum air\textendash sea coupling strength during the boreal summer season. Also, they have stronger climatological zonal SST gradient and shallower climatological thermocline depth over the eastern Pacific during the boreal summer season.},

The seasonal variation in incident solar radiation is ignored. Emphasis is placed on the parameter dependence of the models' sensitivity to changes in the solar constant. It is found in all cases that increasing the efficiency of the poleward transport of energy increases this sensitivity. It is also suggested that knowledge of the partitioning of the transport between the atmosphere and the oceans is of considerable importance for estimating sensitivity. The stability of equilibrium states is determined from the properties of small perturbations away from equilibrium. It is observed that relaxation times of perturbations can be increased considerably by the albedo feedback mechanism. The effect of variations in the obliquity of the planet's orbit on sensitivity and stability is also analyzed.

These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes, the increase in horizontal moisture transport, the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance, and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics. A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

Horizontal spectral resolution is T159 (about 125 km), using 91 levels in the vertical from the surface up to 1 Pa, and a time step of 1 h. This ensemble, denoted by ERA-20CM, formed the first step toward a twentieth-century reanalysis within ERA-CLIM, a three-year European funded project involving nine partners. Sea-surface temperature and sea-ice cover are prescribed by an ensemble of realizations (HadISST2), as recently produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre within ERA-CLIM. Variation in these realizations reflect uncertainties in the available observational sources on which this product is based. Forcing terms in the model radiation scheme follow CMIP5 recommendations. Any effect of their uncertainty is neglected. These terms include solar forcing, greenhouse gases, ozone and aerosols. Both the ocean surface and radiative forcing incorporate a proper long-term evolution of climate trends in the twentieth century, and the occurrence of major events, such as the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillations and volcanic eruptions. No atmospheric observations were assimilated. For this reason ERA-20CM is not able to reproduce actual synoptic situations. However, the ensemble is able to provide a statistical estimate of the climate. Overall, the temperature rise over land is in fair agreement with the CRUTEM4 observational product. Over the last two decades the warming over land exceeds the warming over sea, which is consistent with models participating in the CMIP5 project, as well as with the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Some aspects of warming and of the hydrological cycle are discerned, and the model response to volcanic eruptions is qualitatively correct. The data from ERA-20CM are freely available, embracing monthly-mean fields for many atmospheric and ocean-wave quantities, and synoptic fields for a small, essential subset.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {We use a simple, semianalytic, column model to understand better the meridional structure of the tropopause height and future changes in its height and temperature associated with global warming. The model allows us to separate the effects of tropospheric lapse rate, optical depth, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and stratospheric cooling on the tropopause height. When applied locally at each latitudinal band, the model predicts the overall meridional structure of the tropopause height, with a tropical tropopause substantially higher than in higher latitudes and a sharp transition at the edge of the extratropics. The large optical depth of the Tropics, due mainly to the large water-vapour path, is the dominant tropospheric effect producing the higher tropical tropopause, whereas the larger tropical lapse rate actually acts to lower the tropopause height. The dynamical cooling induced by the stratospheric circulation lifts the thermal tropopause in the Tropics further, resulting in it being significantly cooler and higher than in mid- and high-latitudes. The model quantifies the causes of the tropopause height increase with global warming that is found robustly in climate integrations from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The large spread in the increase rate of tropopause height in the CMIP5 model is captured by the simple model, which attributes the dominant contributions to changes in water-vapour path and lapse rate, with changes in CO2 concentration and OLR having much smaller direct effects. The CMIP5 models also show a small but robust increase in the tropopause temperature in low latitudes, with a much smaller increase in higher latitudes. We suggest that the tropical increase may be caused at least in part by nongrey effects in the radiative transfer associated with the higher levels of water vapour in the Tropics, with near-constant tropopause temperatures predicted otherwise.},

A spectral perspective of this ``super-greenhouse effect'' is provided, which demonstrates the roles of water vapor line and continuum absorptions at different altitudes and the influences due to clouds. A model-satellite comparison indicates that the GFDL General Circulation Model can fairly well represent the total-sky radiative response to SST in the water vapor infrared absorption band despite the significant bias in the mean state, but this comprises compensating water vapor- and cloud-related errors. The analysis also reveals that the GCM significantly underestimates the cloud induced radiative responses in the window region which arises from the model bias in the mean cloud forcing in convectively active regions. Thus, spectral decomposition proves essential to understand and assess the OLR-SST relationship and the impacts of water vapor and cloud upon this linkage.},

When deep convections are highly suppressed with a large Tokioka parameter, the model is capable of simulating distinct two-types of El Ni\~no. However, the model has a problem in simulating two-types of El Ni\~no distinctively when the Tokioka parameter is small, because the location of the maximum precipitation anomaly related to the CT El Ni\~no is significantly shifted westward, leading to an atmospheric response pattern similar to that of the WP El Ni\~no. Our results suggest that the mean precipitation over the eastern equatorial Pacific and the resultant zonal distribution in atmospheric feedback associated with ENSO can be one of the crucial factors for simulating two-types of El Ni\~no.},

The subgrid-scale eddies exchange energy with the resolved flow in both directions via a parameterization of baroclinic instability (based on the established formulation of Gent and McWilliams) and biharmonic and negative Laplacian viscosity terms. This formulation represents the turbulent cascades of energy and enstrophy consistent with our current understanding of the turbulent eddy energy cycle. At the same time, the approach is simple and general enough to be readily implemented in ocean climate models, without adding significant computational cost. The closure has been implemented in the Modular Ocean Model Version 6 and tested in the ``Neverworld'' configuration, which employs an idealized analytically defined topography designed as a testbed for mesoscale eddy parameterizations. The parameterization performs well over a range of resolutions, seamlessly connecting non-eddying and eddy-resolving regimes.},

Using a set of idealized simulations with specified surface warming and superparameterized convection, we find support for these previous conclusions. We use an energy and mass balance framework to develop a simple diagnostic that links the fractional area covered by the region of upward motion to the strength of the mean circulation. We demonstrate that the diagnostic works well for our idealized simulations and use it to understand how changes in tropical ascent area and the strength of the mean circulation relate to changes in heating in the ascending and descending regions. We show that the decrease in the strength of the mean circulation can be explained by the relatively slow rate at which atmospheric radiative cooling intensifies with warming. In our simulations, decreases in tropical ascent area are balanced by increases in nonradiative heating in convective regions. Consistent with previous work, we find a warming-induced decrease in the mean convective mass flux. However, when we condition by the sign of the mean vertical motion, the warming-induced changes in the convective mass flux are nonmonotonic and opposite between the ascending and descending regions.},

Based on different climate simulations of the present day (CTR) and conducted with distinct Antarctic ice sheet topography (AIS-EXP), it is found that the reduction of the Antarctic ice sheet topography (AIS) induces warming of the Southern Hemisphere and reduces the meridional thermal gradient. Consequently, the atmospheric transient low level eddy heat flux \$\$[(\textbackslash overline\{v\^\{\textbackslash prime\}T\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\})]\$\$and the eddy momentum flux \$\$[(\textbackslash overline\{u\^\{\textbackslash prime\}v\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\})]\$\$are reduced causing the reduced transport of heat from the mid-latitudes to the pole. The stationary flow and transient wave anomalies generate changes in the SSTs which modify the rate of deep water formation, strengthening the formation of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Substantial changes are predicted to occur in the atmospheric and oceanic heat transport and a comparison between the total heat transport of the atmosphere-ocean system, as simulated by the AIS-EXP and the CTR runs, shows that the reduction of the AIS height leads to reduced Southern Hemisphere poleward and increased equatorward heat transport. These results are in agreement with reduced storm track activities and baroclinicity.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The algorithm to produce the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Edition 4.0 (Ed4) Energy Balanced and Filled (EBAF)-surface data product is explained. The algorithm forces computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) irradiances to match with Ed4 EBAF-TOA irradiances by adjusting surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties. Surface irradiances are subsequently adjusted using radiative kernels. The adjustment process is composed of two parts: bias correction and Lagrange multiplier. The bias in temperature and specific humidity between 200 and 500 hPa used for the irradiance computation is corrected based on observations by Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Similarly, the bias in the cloud fraction is corrected based on observations by Cloud\textendash Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and CloudSat. Remaining errors in surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties are corrected in the Lagrange multiplier process. Ed4 global annual mean (January 2005 through December 2014) surface net shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) irradiances increase by 1.3 W m-2 and decrease by 0.2 W m-2, respectively, compared to EBAF Edition 2.8 (Ed2.8) counterparts (the previous version), resulting in an increase in net SW + LW surface irradiance of 1.1 W m-2. The uncertainty in surface irradiances over ocean, land, and polar regions at various spatial scales are estimated. The uncertainties in all-sky global annual mean upward and downward shortwave irradiance are 3 and 4 W m-2, respectively, and the uncertainties in upward and downward longwave irradiance are 3 and 6 W m-2, respectively. With an assumption of all errors being independent, the uncertainty in the global annual mean surface LW + SW net irradiance is 8 W m-2.},

Changing the threshold alters both the tropical Pacific mean state and the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability. Increasing the Tokioka parameter causes a basin-wide cooling in the tropical Pacific with the reduction of high clouds. The degree of cooling in the western part of the basin is bigger than that in the east. As a result, the east\textendash west asymmetry in the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) decreases with increasing the Tokioka parameter. Accompanied with the reduced east\textendash west SST asymmetry are the increase of mean precipitation over the eastern Pacific and the eastward shift of the atmospheric responses to the ENSO-related SST forcing. The eastward shifted wind stress anomaly associated with ENSO leads to the stronger ENSO variability. In this way the magnitude of ENSO simulated in this model increases with the Tokioka parameter. Implication of our results on the relationship between the tropical Pacific mean state and ENSO is discussed.},

  abstract = {The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) conducted the second Japanese global atmospheric reanalysis, called the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis or JRA-55. It covers the period from 1958, when regular radiosonde observations began on a global basis. JRA-55 is the first comprehensive reanalysis that has covered the last half-century since the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 45-year Reanalysis (ERA-40), and is the first one to apply four-dimensional variational analysis to this period. The main objectives of JRA-55 were to address issues found in previous reanalyses and to produce a comprehensive atmospheric dataset suitable for studying multidecadal variability and climate change. This paper describes the observations, data assimilation system, and forecast model used to produce JRA-55 as well as the basic characteristics of the JRA-55 product.\hspace{1em}JRA-55 has been produced with the TL319 version of JMA's operational data assimilation system as of December 2009, which was extensively improved since the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25). It also uses several newly available and improved past observations. The resulting reanalysis products are considerably better than the JRA-25 product. Two major problems of JRA-25 were a cold bias in the lower stratosphere, which has been diminished, and a dry bias in the Amazon basin, which has been mitigated. The temporal consistency of temperature analysis has also been considerably improved compared to previous reanalysis products. Our initial quality evaluation revealed problems such as a warm bias in the upper troposphere, large upward imbalance in the global mean net energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, excessive precipitation over the tropics, and unrealistic trends in analyzed tropical cyclone strength. This paper also assesses the impacts of model biases and changes in the observing system, and mentions efforts to further investigate the representation of low-frequency variability and trends in JRA-55.},

  abstract = {Next-generation space telescopes will observe the atmospheres of rocky planets orbiting nearby M-dwarfs. Understanding these observations will require well-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present theoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with gray radiative transfer and test them using a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a radiative-convective (RC) model that captures surface temperatures of slowly rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation acts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale wind speeds. Third, we develop an RC-subsiding model which extends our RC model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find that rocky planets develop large day\textendash night temperature gradients at a ratio of wave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat engine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting atmospheres. Fourth, we show, using GCM simulations, that rotation only has a strong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b, and show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of short-period planets will require similar amounts of time on the James Webb Space Telescope as detecting molecules via transit spectroscopy, so future observations should pursue both techniques.},

In this work, we develop a theory to explain the magnitude of these winds. We model hot Jupiters as planetary heat engines and show that hot Jupiters are always less efficient than an ideal Carnot engine. Next, we demonstrate that our predicted wind speeds match those from three-dimensional numerical simulations over a broad range of parameters. Finally, we use our theory to evaluate how well different drag mechanisms can match the wind speeds observed with Doppler spectroscopy for HD 189733b and HD 209458b. We find that magnetic drag is potentially too weak to match the observations for HD 189733b, but is compatible with the observations for HD 209458b. In contrast, shear instabilities and/or shocks are compatible with both observations. Furthermore, the two mechanisms predict different wind speed trends for hotter and colder planets than currently observed. As a result, we propose that a wider range of Doppler observations could reveal multiple drag mechanisms at play across different hot Jupiters.},

  abstract = {Satellite measurements and radiative calculations show that Earth's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is an essentially linear function of surface temperature over a wide range of temperatures ({$\greaterequivlnt$}60 K). Linearity implies that radiative forcing has the same impact in warmer as in colder climates and is thus of fundamental importance for understanding past and future climate change. Although the evidence for a nearly linear relation was first pointed out more than 50 y ago, it is still unclear why this relation is valid and when it breaks down. Here we present a simple semianalytical model that explains Earth's linear OLR as an emergent property of an atmosphere whose greenhouse effect is dominated by a condensable gas. Linearity arises from a competition between the surface's increasing thermal emission and the narrowing of spectral window regions with warming and breaks down at high temperatures once continuum absorption cuts off spectral windows. Our model provides a way of understanding the longwave contribution to Earth's climate sensitivity and suggests that extrasolar planets with other condensable greenhouse gases could have climate dynamics similar to Earth's.},

A useful reduced model for geostrophic turbulence is barotropic (2D) turbulence. The focus of this study is on 2D    {$\beta$}   -plane turbulence with quadratic drag, which, although arguably the most realistic barotropic model of ocean turbulence, has remained unexplored thus far. We first review and test classical scaling arguments for the eddy diffusivity in three regimes: the strong friction limit, the weak friction/strong    {$\beta$}    limit, and a transition regime. We then develop a generalized theory by parameterizing the nonlinear eddy\textendash eddy interactions as a stochastic process, which leads to an analytical solution for the eddy diffusivity spectrum, whose integral yields a ``bulk'' diffusivity. The theory successfully predicts the smooth transition of diffusivity across the three regimes, and echoes with the recent argument that eddy phase propagation relative to the mean flow suppresses the eddy diffusivity. Moreover, the generalized theory reduces to the classical scaling arguments in both the strong friction and strong    {$\beta$}    limits, which has not been clear from the previous work on diffusivity suppression by flow-relative phase propagation.},

Previous work suggests that the frequency, intensity, and lifetime of these storms may be functions of the climate state, implying that transient tropical mixing could have been stronger during warmer equable climates with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide. Stronger mixing of the tropical oceans can force the oceans' meridional heat flux to increase, cooling tropical latitudes while warming higher ones. This response differs significantly from previous modeling studies of equable climates that used static mixing; coupling mixing to climate changes the dynamic response. A parameterization of mixing from tropical cyclones is developed, and including it leads to a cooling of tropical oceans and a warming of subtropical waters compared with control cases with fixed mixing. The mixing penetration depth regulates the magnitude of the response.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Some regions, including large areas of the central and western North Pacific, feature higher potential intensities at the LGM than they do in the control runs, while other regions including much of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are lower. Changes in potential intensity are strongly correlated with the degree of surface cooling during the LGM. Additionally, two thermodynamic parameters\textemdash one that measures midtropospheric entropy deficits relevant for tropical cyclogenesis and another related to the time required for genesis\textemdash are broadly more favorable in the LGM simulation than in the preindustrial era control.

It is shown that anomalous sea ice conditions accounted for virtually all of the estimated Arctic amplification in surface-based warming over the Arctic Ocean, and furthermore they accounted for a large fraction of Arctic amplification occurring over the high-latitude land between 60\textdegree N and the Arctic Ocean. Sea ice loss did not appreciably contribute to observed 2007 land temperature warmth equatorward of 60\textdegree N. Likewise, the observed warming of the free atmosphere attributable to sea ice loss is confined to Arctic latitudes, and is vertically confined to the lowest 1000 m. The results further highlight a strong seasonality of the temperature response to the 2007 sea ice loss. A weak signal of Arctic amplification in surface based warming is found during boreal summer, whereas a dramatically stronger signal is shown to develop during early autumn that persisted through December even as sea ice coverage approached its climatological values in response to the polar night.},

  abstract = {We perform a series of simplified atmospheric GCM runs with fixed zonally symmetric spherical harmonic sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations to study the response of the outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) to SST anomalies of different horizontal scales and structures. The classical linear relationship used in energy balance models between the OLR and the SST holds quite well at high latitudes. This is not the case in the tropics; even for large-scale perturbations, especially antisymmetric about the equator, the correlation is poor. This is explained by the fact that the structure of the Hadley cell controls most of the properties of the tropical atmosphere, causing a local relationship between the surface and the top of the atmosphere to break down. This conclusion is supported by our analyses of the relationship between OLR and SST in the wavenumber domain. For very large-scale SST perturbations (wavenumbers 0\textendash 2) the agreement is reasonable \textemdash{} the OLR response has most of the energy in the same wavenumber. For higher wavenumbers, however, the correlation deteriorates and the OLR response has significant energy in other harmonics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The precipitation efficiency of cumulus congestus clouds is investigated with a new Lagrangian particle framework for large-eddy simulations. The framework is designed to track particles representative of individual water molecules. A Monte Carlo approach facilitates the transition of particles between the different water classes (e.g., vapor, rain, or graupel). With this framework, it is possible to reconstruct the pathways of water as it moves from vapor at a particular altitude to rain at the surface. By tracking water molecules through both physical and microphysical space, the precipitation efficiency can be studied in detail as a function of height.             Large-eddy simulations of individual cumulus congestus clouds show that the clouds convert entrained vapor to surface precipitation with an efficiency of around 10\%. About two-thirds of all vapor that enters the cloud does so by entrainment in the free troposphere, but free-tropospheric vapor accounts for only one-third to one-half of the surface rainfall, with the remaining surface rainfall originating as vapor entrained through the cloud base. The smaller efficiency with which that laterally entrained water is converted into surface precipitation results from the smaller efficiencies with which it condenses, forms precipitating hydrometeors, and reaches the surface.},

A one-time adjustment to shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) TOA fluxes is made to ensure that global mean net TOA flux for July 2005\textendash June 2015 is consistent with the in situ value of 0.71 W m               -2               . While global mean all-sky TOA flux differences between Ed4.0 and Ed2.8 are within 0.5 W m               -2               , appreciable SW regional differences occur over marine stratocumulus and snow/sea ice regions. Marked regional differences in SW clear-sky TOA flux occur in polar regions and dust areas over ocean. Clear-sky LW TOA fluxes in EBAF Ed4.0 exceed Ed2.8 in regions of persistent high cloud cover.

Convection schemes are not required for reasonable climatological precipitation. However, they are essential for reasonable daily precipitation and constraining extreme daily precipitation that otherwise develops. Systematic effects on lapse rate and humidity are likewise modest compared with the intermodel spread. Without parameterized convection Kelvin waves are more realistic. An unexpectedly large moist Southern Hemisphere storm track bias is identified. This storm track bias persists without convection schemes, as does the double Intertropical Convergence Zone and excessive ocean precipitation biases. This suggests that model biases originate from processes other than convection or that convection schemes are missing key processes.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the response of a global model of the climate to the quadrupling of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The model consists of (1) a general circulation model of the atmosphere, (2) a heat and water balance model of the continents, and (3) a simple mixed layer model of the oceans. It has a global computational domain and realistic geography. For the computation of radiative transfer, the seasonal variation of insolation is imposed at the top of the model atmosphere, and the fixed distribution of cloud cover is prescribed as a function of latitude and of height. It is found that with some exceptions, the model succeeds in reproducing the large-scale characteristics of seasonal and geographical variation of the observed atmospheric temperature. The climatic effect of a CO2 increase is determined by comparing statistical equilibrium states of the model atmosphere with a normal concentration and with a 4 times the normal concentration of CO2 in the air. It is found that the warming of the model atmosphere resulting from the CO2 increase has significant seasonal and latitudinal variation. Because of the absence of an albedo feedback mechanism, the warming over the Antarctic continent is somewhat less than the warming in high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Over the Arctic Ocean and its surroundings, the warming is much larger in winter than summer, thereby reducing the amplitude of seasonal temperature variation. It is concluded that this seasonal asymmetry in the warming results from the reduction in the coverage and thickness of the sea ice. The warming of the model atmosphere results in an enrichment of the moisture content in the air and an increase in the poleward moisture transport. The additional moisture is picked up from the tropical ocean and is brought to high latitudes where both precipitation and runoff increase throughout the year. Further, the time of rapid snowmelt and maximum runoff becomes earlier.},

Climate models, supported by a growing body of observational data, have demonstrated that storm tracks shift poleward as the climate warms. But the dynamical mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unclear. To isolate what portion of the storm track shift may be accounted for by large-scale dry dynamics alone, disregarding the latent heat released in phase changes of water, this study investigates the storm track shift under various kinds of climate change in an idealized dry general circulation model (GCM) with an adjustable but constant convective stability. It is found that increasing the mean surface temperature or the convective stability leads to poleward shifts of storm tracks, even if the convective stability is increased only in a narrow band around the equator. Under warming and convective stability changes roughly corresponding to a doubling of CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations from a present-day Earthlike climate, storm tracks shift about 0.8\textdegree{} poleward, somewhat less than but in qualitative agreement with studies using moist GCMs. About 63\% (0.5\textdegree ) of the poleward shift is shown to be caused by tropical convective stability variations. This demonstrates that tropical processes alone (the increased dry static stability of a warmer moist adiabat) can account for part of the poleward shift of storm tracks under global warming. This poleward shift generally occurs in tandem with a poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation; however, the Hadley circulation expansion does not always parallel the storm track shift.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Nonetheless, a generally accepted theory of the mechanisms controlling the storm-track shifts is still lacking. Here, mean available potential energy (MAPE), a general measure of baroclinicity that is proportional to the square of the Eady growth rate, is used to understand storm-track shifts. It is demonstrated that, in dry atmospheres, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in a storm track is linearly related to the mean available potential energy, relative to a local reference state, and that maxima of the two are generally collocated in latitude. Changes in MAPE with climate are then decomposed into components. It is shown that in simulations of dry atmospheres, changes in the latitude of maximum MAPE are dominated by changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. By contrast, changes in the magnitude of MAPE are primarily determined by changes in static stability and in the depth of the troposphere. A theory of storm-track shifts may build upon these findings and primarily needs to explain changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. The terminus of the Hadley circulation often shifts in tandem with storm tracks and is hypothesized to play an important role in triggering the storm-track shifts seen in this idealized dry context, especially in simulations where increases only in the convective static stability in the deep tropics suffice to shift storm tracks poleward.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This paper develops an energy balance model that shows how shifts of the Hadley cell terminus and changes of the meridional energy flux out of the Hadley cell can drive shifts of storm tracks, identified as extrema of the atmospheric meridional eddy energy flux. The distance between the Hadley cell terminus and the storm tracks is primarily controlled by the energy flux out of the Hadley cell. Because tropical forcings alone can modify the Hadley cell terminus, they can also shift extratropical storm tracks, as demonstrated through simulations with an idealized GCM. Additionally, a strengthening of the meridional temperature gradient at the terminus and hence of the energy flux out of the Hadley cell can reduce the distance between the Hadley cell terminus and the storm tracks, enabling storm-track shifts that do not parallel shifts of the Hadley cell terminus. Thus, with the aid of the energy balance model and supporting GCM simulations, a closed theory of storm-track shifts emerges.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

These models have a polar amplified warming pattern that is quantitatively similar to general circulation model simulations. Even without surface albedo changes or other spatially varying feedbacks, they simulate polar amplification that results from increased poleward energy transport with warming. Here, two estimates for polar amplification are presented that do not require numerical solution of the EBM governing equation. They are evaluated relative to the results of numerical moist EBM solutions. One estimate considers only changes in a moist thermodynamic quantity (assuming that the increase in energy transport results in a spatially uniform change in moist static energy in the warmed climate) and has more polar amplification than the EBM solution. The other estimate uses a new solution of a truncated form of the moist EBM equation, which allows for a temperature change that is consistent with both the dry and latent energy transport changes, as well as radiative changes. The truncated EBM solution provides an estimate for polar amplification that is nearly identical to that of the numerical EBM solution and only depends on the EBM parameters and climatology of temperature. This solution sheds light on the dependence of polar amplification on the climatological temperature distribution and offers an estimate of the residual polar warming in solar radiation management geoengineered climates.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The tropospheric lapse rate {$\gamma$} is about 6.1 K/km in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) as a whole and over the ocean and about 6.2 K/km over the continents. The value of {$\gamma$} decreases from 6.5 K/km at low latitudes to 4.5 K/km at polar latitudes. The values of d{$\gamma$}/dTs, the parameter of sensitivity of {$\gamma$} to the variation of Ts for the NH in the interannual variability, are found to be about 0.04 km-1 (0.041 km-1 for the NH as a whole, 0.042 km-1 over the ocean, and 0.038 km-1 over the continents). This corresponds to an increase in {$\gamma$} of approximately 0.7\% when the surface temperature of the NH is increased by 1 K. Estimates of d{$\gamma$}/dTs vary from about 0.05 km-1 in the subtropics to 0.10 km-1 at polar latitudes. When d{$\gamma$}/dTs is positive, the surface and tropospheric warming means a temperature decrease above a certain critical level Hcr. The height of the level Hcr with constant temperature, which is defined by the inverse value (d{$\gamma$}/dTs)-1, is about 25 km for the NH as a whole, i.e., above the tropopause. In the subtropics, Hcr is about 20 km. At polar latitudes, Hcr decreases to about 10 km. Positive values of d{$\gamma$}/dTs characterize a positive climatic feedback through the lapse rate and indicate a general decrease in the static stability of the troposphere during global warming. Along with a general tendency of {$\gamma$} to increase with rising Ts, there are regional regimes with the opposite tendency, mainly over the ocean. The negative correlation of {$\gamma$} with Ts is found over the oceanic tropics and midlatitudes, in particular, over the oceanic belt around Antarctica.},

  abstract = {The midlatitude circulation response to climate change is not well understood. Within an energetic framework the circulation is connected to the atmospheric diffusivity. Here we define a novel diagnostic diffusivity framework as a tool for interpreting changes in the midlatitude atmospheric circulation. The diffusivity is computed by dividing the zonally and vertically integrated transient eddy moist static energy (MSE) transport by the zonal-mean 925 hPa MSE gradient, and we investigate the diffusivity response to global-scale sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations in aquaplanet and Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) general circulation model simulations. The midlatitude diffusivity maximum shifts poleward with increasing SST in both the aquaplanet simulations and Southern Hemisphere winter of the AMIP simulations. Our framework indicates that this diffusivity shift is associated with Ferrel circulation and 925 hPa MSE gradient changes, rather than with total MSE transport changes. The MSE gradient-related shift cannot be understood purely in terms of Clausius-Clapeyron changes in specific humidity following the global-mean temperature response, because atmospheric temperature gradients change significantly even when SST gradients are held fixed. The intensity of the diffusivity maximum also increases with SST for the aquaplanet configuration but is relatively insensitive to SST for AMIP Southern Hemisphere winter. Additional energy balance model experiments suggest that while diffusivity changes caused by SST perturbations can be large, their effect on zonal-mean temperature is minor. Finally, the latitudes and intensities of the diffusivity maxima are strongly correlated with the same properties of the zonal-mean eddy kinetic energy maxima. However, existing theories cannot adequately explain these linear relationships.},

Yet the processes triggering melt and causing its large interannual variability are not well understood. Here we show that melt onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier melt onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at melt onset, indicating that melt is not triggered by SWD. When melt occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding melt. In contrast, when melt begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to melt. Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for melt onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier melt onset.},

Data produced by a general circulation model are used to obtain plausible estimates of the energy flux across 70\textdegree S, where direct estimates tend to be poor.

As a model tool, we use a two-column radiative-convective model with an explicit hydrological cycle that uses clear-sky conditions in the radiation calculation. A flow field is calculated by the linearized, hydrostatic equations of motion in a non-rotating frame of reference. Mechanical damping is represented by vertical diffusion of momentum and surface drag. the flow advects heat and moisture, and thereby modifies the local radiative-convective equilibrium. A dynamically passive ocean mixed layer is situated below the model atmosphere. All externally specified parameters are identical in the two columns, implying that local radiative-convective equilibrium is a steady solution. For weak mechanical damping (or small column length), the local equilibrium is generally unstable due to a positive feedback between large-scale subsidence and infrared cooling, which operates via advective drying. A circulating equilibrium, in which the air ascends in one column and descends in the other, is attained. Due to a reduced content of clear-sky water vapour, which is the major infrared absorber in the model, the circulating equilibrium can emit the absorbed solar radiation at a significantly lower surface temperature than the corresponding local equilibrium. In the limit of a nearly inviscid atmosphere, the intensity of the large-scale circulation is controlled chiefly by the mid-tropospheric radiative cooling in the downdraught column. In this regime, we find two distinct equilibria with circulation that are distinguished by the features of the downdraught column: one branch with deep convection but where the integrated convective heating vanishes due to evaporation of precipitation; and one branch with shallow (or no) convection where the surface boundary layer is disconnected from the free atmosphere.},

In the model the latitudinal distribution of the zonal average surface temperature is represented by a series of Legendre polynomials, while its time-dependence is represented by a Fourier sine-cosine series. The model has three parameters which are adjusted so that the observed amplitudes of the Northern Hemisphere's zonal mean surface temperature are recovered. In order to obtain the correct amplitude and phase of the surface temperature's seasonal oscillation, allowance must be made for the disparity between the thermal inertia of the atmosphere over continents and that of the ocean's mixed layer. Although the model parameters are adjusted to recover the surface temperature fields of the Northern Hemisphere, a test of the model's ability to produce the fields of the Southern Hemisphere indicates that the model responds properly to changes in boundary conditions.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The seasonal model is used to reveal how the annual mean climate and its sensitivity to changes in incident radiation differ from the predictions obtained with the corresponding mean annual model. Although the zonal temperatures obtained with the seasonal model are 1\textendash 3\textdegree C higher than those obtained with the mean annual model, the changes in the global average annual mean surface temperatures calculated with the two models are practically identical for a 1\% decrease in solar constant. Furthermore, because the albedo changes in them are linked mainly to changes in surface temperature, both models respond in the same manner to changes in the incident solar radiation caused by changes in the earth's orbit. The distribution of the incident solar radiation in the models is shown to be insensitive to changes in the eccentricity and the longitude of perihelion and sensitive only to changes in the obliquity of the earth. For past orbital changes, both the seasonal and the mean annual model fail to produce glacial advances of the magnitude that are thought to have occurred.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Compared to winter, the occurrence and properties of summer inversions depended much less on surface net radiation and were mainly controlled by the surface melt and warm-air advection. Inversions occurring during snow/ice melt were located at low altitudes, frequently based at the surface, and were often as strong as winter inversions reported in previous studies. In general, the Tara inversions were shallow, and the deepest ones were observed when clouds occurred inside or partly above the inversion layer. Inversions were strongest under clear skies or in cases when the cloud top was above the inversion base. Related to cases of strong warm-air advection (up to 35 K day-1) in July, exceptionally high temperatures around the inversion top caused maximum inversion strengths up to 13 K. Inversions of this magnitude at this time of year have been rarely documented previously.},

An analysis of the thermodynamic transformations of atmospheric water yields what is referred to as the entropy budget of the water substance, providing a quantitative relationship between these three aspects of moist convection.

Scaling arguments show that the expansion work of water vapor accounts for a small fraction of the work that would be produced in the absence of irreversible moist processes. It is also shown that diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes can be interpreted as the irreversible counterpart to the continuous dehumidification resulting from condensation and precipitation.

Because of the turbulent nature of the flow, any description of a ``mean circulation'' or ``mean parcel trajectories'' is tied to the specific averaging method and coordinate system. In this paper, the NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis data spanning 1970\textendash 2004 are used to compare the mean circulation obtained by averaging the flow on surfaces of constant liquid water potential temperature, or dry isentropes, and on surfaces of constant equivalent potential temperature, or moist isentropes. While the two circulations are qualitatively similar, they differ in intensity. In the tropics, the total mass transport on dry isentropes is larger than the circulation on moist isentropes. In contrast, in midlatitudes, the total mass transport on moist isentropes is between 1.5 and 3 times larger than the mass transport on dry isentropes.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}It is shown here that the differences between the two circulations can be explained by the atmospheric transport of water vapor. In particular, the enhanced mass transport on moist isentropes corresponds to a poleward flow of warm moist air near the earth's surface in midlatitudes. This low-level poleward flow does not appear in the zonally averaged circulation on dry isentropes, as it is hidden by the presence of a larger equatorward flow of drier air at same potential temperature. However, as the equivalent potential temperature in this low-level poleward flow is close to the potential temperature of the air near the tropopause, it is included in the total circulation on moist isentropes. In the tropics, the situation is reversed: the Hadley circulation transports warm moist air toward the equator, and in the opposite direction to the flow at upper levels, and the circulation on dry isentropes is larger than that on moist isentropes.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The relationship between circulation and entropy transport is also analyzed. A gross stratification is defined as the ratio of the entropy transport to the net transport on isentropic surfaces. It is found that in midlatitudes the gross stability for moist entropy is approximately the same as that for dry entropy. The gross stratification in the midlatitude circulation differs from what one would expect for either an overturning circulation or horizontal mixing; rather, it confirms that warm moist subtropical air ascends into the upper troposphere within the storm tracks.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This approach relies on two key steps. First, mean trajectories are obtained by computing the mean circulation using height and equivalent potential temperature as coordinates. Second, thermodynamic properties along these trajectories are approximated by using their conditionally averaged values at the same height and {$<$}em{$>\theta <$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}e{$<$}/em{$>$}}. This yields a complete description of the properties of air parcels that undergo a set of idealized thermodynamic cycles.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}MAFALDA is applied to analyze the behavior of an atmosphere in radiative\textendash convective equilibrium. The convective overturning is decomposed into 20 thermodynamic cycles, each accounting for 5\% of the total mass transport. The work done by each cycle can be expressed as the difference between the maximum work that would have been done by an equivalent Carnot cycle and a penalty that arises from the injection and removal of water at different values of its Gibbs free energy. The analysis indicates that the Gibbs penalty reduces the work done by all thermodynamic cycles by about 55\%. The cycles are also compared with those obtained for doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide, which in the model used here leads to an increase in surface temperature of about 3.4 K. It is shown that warming greatly increases both the energy transport and work done per unit mass of air circulated. As a result, the ratio of the kinetic energy generation to the convective mass flux increases by about 20\% in the simulations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Inversion strength plays an important role in regulating atmospheric processes including air pollution, ozone destruction, cloud formation, and negative longwave feedback mechanisms that shape polar climate response to anthropogenic forcing. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument provides reliable measures of spatial patterns in mean wintertime inversion strength when compared with available radiosonde observations and reanalysis products. Here, we examine the influence of sea ice concentration on inversion strength in the Arctic and Antarctic. Correlation of inversion strength with mean annual sea ice concentration, likely a surrogate for the effective thermal conductivity of the wintertime ice pack, yields strong, linear relationships in the Arctic (r~=~0.88) and Antarctic (r~=~0.86). We find a substantially greater (stronger) linear relationship between sea ice concentration and surface air temperature than with temperature at 850~hPa, lending credence to the idea that sea ice controls inversion strength through modulation of surface heat fluxes. As such, declines in sea ice in either hemisphere may imply weaker mean inversions in the future. Comparison of mean inversion strength in AIRS and global climate models (GCMs) suggests that many GCMs poorly characterize mean inversion strength at high latitudes.},

The global maps show maxima in the equatorial zone and minima in the dry subtropical belts around 30\textdegree N and 30\textdegree S. The land\textendash sea contrast and variations related to the orographic relief are also apparent. The general pattern of relative humidity is similar at all levels but its magnitude decreases with altitude. The seasonal analyses show a similar pattern as the annual analyses but are slightly shifted toward the summer pole.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The saturation deficit is also evaluated.

The stationary eddy distributions are less pronounced than the transient ones and do not change substantially from one season to another.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}To validate our results, several comparisons are made using independent sources of humidity data as well as cloud distributions at various levels. Thus, COADS data are used to obtain independent analyses of the surface relative humidity over the oceans, and satellite observations by SAGE are used at the 300-mb level. The rawinsonde-SAGE differences are on the order of 10\% in the Tropics and 20\% in the high latitudes, due in part to a clear-sky (dry) bias in the SAGE data. Our results are further compared with those obtained from operational analyses by the ECMWF. The differences do not exceed 5\% in the Tropics but tend to be larger in the tropical upper troposphere and at all levels in the extratropies of the Southern Hemisphere, where the radiosonde network is quite sparse. In view of the obvious connections between the moisture distribution in the atmosphere and cloudiness, a cloud climatology is used to cheek its consistency with the present results. The latitudinal and interseasonal variations of cloudiness and relative humidity are similar, with maxima in the equatorial belt and at high latitudes and minima in the subtropics that shift poleward during summer and equatorward during winter.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Finally, some comments are made on the radiosonde-observing systems in the light of recent satellite studies of humidity.

While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we show that precipitation variability in most climate models increases over a majority of global land area in response to warming (66\% of land has a robust increase in variability of seasonal-mean precipitation). Comparing recent decades to RCP8.5 projections for the end of the 21st century, we find that in the global, multi-model mean, precipitation variability increases 3\textendash 4\%\,K-1 globally, 4\textendash 5\%\,K-1 over land and 2\textendash 4\%\,K-1 over ocean, and is remarkably robust on a range of timescales from daily to decadal. Precipitation variability increases by at least as much as mean precipitation and less than moisture and extreme precipitation for most models, regions, and timescales. We interpret this as being related to an increase in moisture which is partially mitigated by weakening circulation. We show that changes in observed daily variability in station data are consistent with increased variability.},

It is argued that evaporation on its own cannot provide an effective regulating mechanism. Clouds cannot serve as regulators unless there are substantial departures from the observed cancellation between cloud greenhouse and cloud albedo effects. In particular, it is shown that the prediction by Ramanathan and Collins of highly stable tropical climates is based on an inconsistent set of assumptions about the behavior of the atmospheric heat transports. When the heat transports are treated in a consistent manner, clouds are found to have little impact, and the tropical climate can he quite sensitive to radiative perturbations.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}It is found that the main determinant of tropical climate is the clear-sky water vapor greenhouse effect averaged over the entire Tropics. In the absence of dry ``radiator fins'' maintained by subsidence, the tropical temperature would tend to fall into a runaway greenhouse state that could be stabilized only by heat export to the extratropics. Some speculative results on sensitivity of the climate to perturbations are presented. Determination of the relative area of dry and subsiding versus moist and convecting regions of the Tropics, and of the degree of dryness of the subsiding regions, are identified as key unsolved problems concerning the tropical climate.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The problem of deglaciating a globally ice-covered (``hard snowball'') Earth is examined using a series of general circulation model simulations. The aim is to determine the amount of CO2 that must be accumulated in the atmosphere in order to trigger deglaciation. Prior treatments of this problem have been limited to energy balance models, which are incapable of treating certain crucial physical processes that turn out to strongly affect the conditions under which deglaciation can occur. CO2 concentrations up to .2 bars are considered in the general circulation model simulations, and even at such high CO2 content the model radiation code is found to perform well in comparison with codes explicitly designed for high CO2. In contrast to prevailing expectations, the hard snowball Earth is found to be nearly 30 K short of deglaciation, even at .2 bars. The very cold climates arise from a combination of the extreme seasonal and diurnal cycle, lapse rate effects, snow cover, and weak cloud effects. Several aspects of the atmospheric dynamics are examined in detail. The simulations indicate that the standard scenario, wherein snowball termination occurs after a few tenths of a bar of CO2 has built up following cessation of weathering, is problematic. However, the climate was found to be sensitive to details of a number of parameterized physical processes, notably clouds and heat transfer through the stable boundary layer. It is not out of the question that other parameterization suites might permit deglaciation. The results should not be construed as meaning that the hard snowball state could not have occurred, but only that deglaciation requires the operation of as-yet undiscovered processes that would enhance the climate sensitivity. A brief survey of some of the possibilities is provided.},

  abstract = {In 2005 the Study of Stable Boundary Layer Environment at Dome C (STABLEDC) experimental campaign was conducted at the plateau station of Concordia at Dome C, Antarctica. Temperature profiles measured with a microwave radiometer were used to study the characteristics of surface-based temperature inversions over the course of a year. Statistics of temperature profiles for every month are discussed; the difference between daytime and nocturnal cases observed during the summer months disappears during winter. Surface-based temperature inversions occurred in 70~\% of the time during summer, and almost all of the time during winter. During winter the occurrence of warming events leads to a decrease in the temperature difference between the top and the base of the inversion (i.e. the inversion strength). The inversion strength maxima ranged between \$\$3\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\textbackslash mathrm\{C\}\$\$3{$\circ$}C(December) and \$\$35\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\textbackslash mathrm\{C\}\$\$35{$\circ$}C(August) corresponding to gradients of 0.1 and \$\$0.3\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\textbackslash mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\^\{-1\}\$\$0.3{$\circ$}Cm-1, respectively. The average surface-based inversion height presents a daily cycle during the summer months with values up to 200~m in the morning hours, while it affects a layer always deeper than 100~m during the winter months. The relationships between inversion strength and the downward longwave radiative flux, absolute temperature, and wind speed are examined. The inversion strength decreases as the longwave radiation increases. A clear anti-correlation between inversion strength and near-surface temperature is evident throughout the year. During the winter, the largest inversion strength values were observed under low wind-speed conditions; in contrast, a clear dependence was not found during the summer.},

They have important impacts on both radiative and turbulent heat fluxes and partly determine local climate-change feedbacks. Understanding the spread in inversion strength modelled by current global climate models is therefore an important step in better understanding Arctic climate and its present and future changes. Here, we show how the formation of Arctic air masses leads to the emergence of a cloudy and a clear state of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water is present, little to no surface radiative cooling occurs and inversions are elevated and relatively weak, whereas surface radiative cooling leads to strong surface-based temperature inversions in the clear state. Comparing model output to observations, we find that most climate models lack a realistic representation of the cloudy state. An idealised single-column model experiment of the formation of Arctic air reveals that this bias is linked to inadequate mixed-phase cloud microphysics, whereas turbulent and conductive heat fluxes control the strength of inversions within the clear state.},

By assuming that these fields are an invariant function of atmospheric temperature and that temperature change follows a dilute moist adiabat, we are able to accurately predict cloud fraction and RH changes in the tropical upper troposphere (150\textendash 400 hPa) in 27 general circulation models. Our results indicate that intermodel spread in changes of tropical upper tropospheric clouds and RH is closely related to differences in model climatology and could be substantially reduced if model ensembles reliably reproduced observed climatologies.},

In the summer, melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea ice, significantly lowering the ice reflectivity (albedo) and thereby accelerating ice melt. Pond geometry controls the details of this crucial feedback; however, a reliable model of pond geometry does not currently exist. Here we show that a simple model of voids surrounding randomly sized and placed overlapping circles reproduces the essential features of pond patterns. The only two model parameters, characteristic circle radius and coverage fraction, are chosen by comparing, between the model and the aerial photographs of the ponds, two correlation functions which determine the typical pond size and their connectedness. Using these parameters, the void model robustly reproduces the ponds' area-perimeter and area-abundance relationships over more than 6 orders of magnitude. By analyzing the correlation functions of ponds on several dates, we also find that the pond scale and the connectedness are surprisingly constant across different years and ice types. Moreover, we find that ponds resemble percolation clusters near the percolation threshold. These results demonstrate that the geometry and abundance of Arctic melt ponds can be simply described, which can be exploited in future models of Arctic melt ponds that would improve predictions of the response of sea ice to Arctic warming.},

  abstract = {During the summer, vast regions of Arctic sea ice are covered by meltwater ponds that significantly lower the ice reflectivity and accelerate melting. Ponds develop over the melt season through an initial rapid growth stage followed by drainage through macroscopic holes. Recent analysis of melt pond photographs indicates that late-summer ponds exist near the critical percolation threshold, a special pond coverage fraction below which the ponds are largely disconnected and above which they are highly connected. Here, we show that the percolation threshold, a statistical property of ice topography, constrains pond evolution due to pond drainage through macroscopic holes. We show that it sets the approximate upper limit and scales pond coverage throughout its evolution after the beginning of drainage. Furthermore, we show that the rescaled pond coverage during drainage is a universal function of a single non-dimensional parameter, {$\eta$}, roughly interpreted as the number of drainage holes per characteristic area of the surface. This universal curve allows us to formulate an equation for pond coverage time-evolution during and after pond drainage that captures the dependence on environmental parameters and is supported by observations on undeformed first-year ice. This equation reveals that pond coverage is highly sensitive to environmental parameters, suggesting that modeling uncertainties could be reduced by more directly parameterizing the ponds' natural parameter, {$\eta$}. Our work uncovers previously unrecognized constraints on melt pond physics and places ponds within a broader context of phase transitions and critical phenomena. Therefore, it holds promise for improving ice-albedo parameterizations in large-scale models.},

Snow on top of the ice decreases ice's thermal conductivity, increases its reflectivity (albedo), and provides a source of meltwater for melt ponds during summer that decrease the ice's albedo. In this paper, we develop a simple model of premelt snow topography that accurately describes snow cover of flat, undeformed Arctic sea ice on several study sites for which data were available. The model considers a surface that is a sum of randomly sized and placed ``snow dunes'' represented as Gaussian mounds. This model generalizes the ``void model'' of Popovi\'c et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.148701) and, as such, accurately describes the statistics of melt pond geometry. We test this model against detailed LiDAR measurements of the premelt snow topography. We show that the model snow depth distribution is statistically indistinguishable from the measurements on flat ice, while small disagreement exists if the ice is deformed. We then use this model to determine analytic expressions for the conductive heat flux through the ice and for melt pond coverage evolution during an early stage of pond formation. We also formulate a criterion for ice to remain pond-free throughout the summer. Results from our model could be directly included in large-scale models, thereby improving our understanding of energy balance on sea ice and allowing for more reliable predictions of Arctic sea ice in a future climate.},

  abstract = {Global warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions is expected to reduce the capability of the ocean and the land biosphere to take up carbon. This will enlarge the fraction of the CO2 emissions remaining in the atmosphere, which in turn will reinforce future climate change. Recent model studies agree in the existence of such a positive climate\textendash carbon cycle feedback, but the estimates of its amplitude differ by an order of magnitude, which considerably increases the uncertainty in future climate projections. Therefore we discuss, in how far a particular process or component of the carbon cycle can be identified, that potentially contributes most to the positive feedback. The discussion is based on simulations with a carbon cycle model, which is embedded in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPI-OM. Two simulations covering the period 1860\textendash 2100 are conducted to determine the impact of global warming on the carbon cycle. Forced by historical and future carbon dioxide emissions (following the scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), they reveal a noticeable positive climate\textendash carbon cycle feedback, which is mainly driven by the tropical land biosphere. The oceans contribute much less to the positive feedback and the temperate/boreal terrestrial biosphere induces a minor negative feedback. The contrasting behavior of the tropical and temperate/boreal land biosphere is mostly attributed to opposite trends in their net primary productivity (NPP) under global warming conditions. As these findings depend on the model employed they are compared with results derived from other climate\textendash carbon cycle models, which participated in the Coupled Climate\textendash Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP).},

In a simple case this might consist of a moist adiabat with the saturated moist entropy of the adiabat equaling the moist entropy of the boundary layer. In more complex cases the target temperature profile might depend on the moisture profile as well as boundary layer conditions. We present evidence from analytical and numerical calculations which challenge the validity of this hypothesis. These calculations involve both a simple, physically based parameterization of the effects of convection on its environment and a complex cloud-resolving model. In both cases we show that imposed temperature perturbations in the lower troposphere are rapidly eliminated, while those in the upper troposphere are not. The rapid temperature relaxation in the lower troposphere is due to the near-instantaneous change in the precipitation rate and latent heat release provoked by the temperature anomaly. Water vapor is so limited in the upper troposphere that this process cannot act there.},

The essential difference between our model and other radiative-convective models is that in our model the moisture profile (but not cloudiness) is interactively computed by the cumulus convection scheme. This has a crucial influence on the computation of the radiative fluxes throughout the atmosphere and therefore on the model's sensitivities. Using the Emanuel scheme, we show that the climate equilibrium is very sensitive to cloud microphysical processes. Clouds with high precipitation efficiency produce cold and dry climates. Clouds with low precipitation efficiency lead to moist and warm climates. Since climate equilibrium can be very sensitive to the cloud microphysical processes, any cumulus convection scheme adequate for use in general circulation models (GCMs) should be strongly based on them. The cumulus convection schemes currently in use in GCMs bypass the microphysical processes by making arbitrary moistening assumptions. We suggest that they are inadequate for climate change studies.},

This result is referred to as a runaway greenhouse. The cumulus convection parameterization schemes currently in use in global climate models (GCMs) employ different assumptions about moistening. This causes the critical solar forcing above which a runaway greenhouse occurs to be very sensitive to the cumulus convection scheme employed. Furthermore, using the microphysically based cumulus convection scheme proposed by Emanuel [1991], we show that the sensitivity of the equilibrium temperature to changes in the solar forcing depends crucially on the microphysics of cumulus convection. For fixed cloud conditions, the critical solar forcing for a runaway greenhouse to occur is between approximately 1.22 and 1.49 times the global mean value for the Earth, and for clear sky conditions, it is a few percent lower. The runaway greenhouse in the experiments with the mass flux schemes generally occurs more rapidly than in the experiments with the adjustment schemes. In addition, the inability of the hard convective adjustment scheme to produce an efficient vertical transport of moisture, together with the saturation requirement for convection to occur, leads to the breakdown of the radiative-convective equilibria when other processes are not available to provide the necessary vertical transport of water vapor.},

Since the heat source is located at higher pressure than the heat sink, the system is capable of doing mechanical work. Atmospheric convection is a natural heat engine that might operate in this system. Based on the heat engine framework, a simple theory is presented for atmospheric convection that predicts the buoyancy, the vertical velocity, and the fractional area covered by either dry or moist convection in a state of statistical equilibrium. During one cycle of the convective heat engine, heat is taken from the surface layer (the hot source) and a portion of it is rejected to the free troposphere (the cold sink) from where it is radiated to space. The balance is transformed into mechanical work. The mechanical work is expended in the maintenance of the convective motions against mechanical dissipation. Ultimately, the energy dissipated by mechanical friction is transformed into heat. Then, a fraction of the dissipated energy is radiated to space while the remaining portion is recycled by the convecting air parcels. Increases in the fraction of energy dissipated at warmer temperature, at the expense of decreases in the fraction of energy dissipated at colder temperatures, lead to increases in the apparent efficiency of the convective heat engine. The volume integral of the work produced by the convective heat engine gives a measure of the statistical equilibrium amount of convective available potential energy (CAPE) that must be present in the planet's atmosphere so that the convective motions can be maintained against viscous dissipation. This integral is a fundamental global number qualifying the state of the planet in statistical equilibrium conditions. For the earth's present climate, the heat engine framework predicts a CAPE value of the order of 1000 J kg\textsuperscript{-1} for the tropical atmosphere. This value is in agreement with observations. It also follows from our results that the total amount of CAPE present in a convecting atmosphere should increase with increases in the global surface temperature (or the atmosphere's opacity to infrared radiation).{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional, radiative-convective model is used to study the equilibria conditions of moist atmospheres. We show that when the hydrologic cycle is included in the model a subcritical bifurcation occurs, leading to 2 linearly stable solutions to the radiative-convective equilibria. In this case, when the net forcing is larger than a critical value, two equilibria are possible. Furthermore, a finite amplitude instability can lead to a runaway greenhouse regime when the solar forcing is larger than a second critical value. In general, previous climate studies with radiative-convective models did not include a hydrologic cycle. Instead, the atmosphere's water vapor mixing ratio was diagnosed based on the climatological profile of relative humidity. We show that fixing the water vapor relative humidity profile at the climatological value (in the computation of the radiation fluxes only) leads to a unique stable solution to the radiative-convective equilibria. Thus, the crucial part of the hydrologic cycle which allows multiple solutions is the relaxation of the assumption of a climatological relative humidity profile. Our results do not apply directly to any real planet because of large uncertainties in our calculation due to the absence of clouds and the use of a one-dimensional model. The 1st equilibrium corresponds to an optically thin atmosphere. In this regime, the system is nearly linear and is in a state of small dissipation. The 2nd equilibrium corresponds to an optically thick atmosphere. In this 2nd regime, the system is highly nonlinear and is in a state of large dissipation.},

In such simulations, mesoscale organization appears naturally, independent of the particulars of the initial condition. As the magnitude of an imposed low-level shear increases, the convection becomes increasingly organized in lines or arcs, propagating broadly downshear, as predicted by earlier work. When the shear is very strong, the convection tends to organize into lines at an angle to the shear, such that the line-normal component is not far from its theoretical optimal value. Midlevel shear favors shear-parallel lines, but if it occurs in conjunction with sufficiently strong low-level shear, the convection can become very strongly organized into lines or arcs generally orthogonal to the low-level shear. Optimal organization occurs when the depth of the shear layer is comparable to that of the cold pools associated with the convective downdrafts.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}As the vertical shear is increased, the domain-averaged convective available potential energy (CAPE) at first increases but then decreases at stronger shear values. Associated with these changes, the lower to middle troposphere becomes drier at low shear values and more humid when the shear is strong. This relationship between humidity and CAPE is broadly consistent with recently developed CAPE theories. The authors also confirm previous work that shows that the transport of momentum by the simulated convection, though usually down the gradient of the background flow, is nonlocal in character.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Finally, some simulations are performed with an imposed hodograph taken from a tropical cyclone.

Surface heat flux and ocean heat content estimates are combined using a novel Kalman smoother-based method. Regional contributions from ocean heat transport convergences are inferred as a residual and the dominant drivers of Hmld and Htot are quantified for seasonal and interannual time scales. We find that non-Ekman ocean heat transport processes dominate Hmld variations in the equatorial oceans and regions of strong ocean currents and substantial eddy activity. In these locations, surface temperature anomalies generated by ocean dynamics result in turbulent flux anomalies that drive the overlying atmosphere. In addition, we find large regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans where heat transports combine with local air-sea fluxes to generate mixed layer temperature anomalies. In all locations, except regions of deep convection and water mass transformation, interannual variations in Htot are dominated by the internal rearrangement of heat by ocean dynamics rather than the loss or addition of heat at the surface. Our analysis suggests that, even in extratropical latitudes, initialization of ocean dynamical processes could be an important source of skill for interannual predictability of Hmld and Htot. Furthermore, we expect variations in Htot (and thus thermosteric sea level) to be more predictable than near surface temperature anomalies due to the increased importance of ocean heat transport processes for full-depth heat budgets.},

A feedback analysis of the snowball earth phenomenon in simple, zonal mean energy balance models clearly reveals the physics of the snowball instability and its dependence on climate parameters. The analysis can also be used to illustrate some fundamental properties of climate feedbacks: how feedback strength changes as a function of mean climate state; how small changes in individual feedbacks can cause large changes in the system sensitivity; and last, how the strength and even the sign of the feedback is dependent on the climate variable in question.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract             The entropy budget has been a popular starting point for theories of the work, or dissipation, performed by moist atmospheres. For a dry atmosphere, the entropy budget provides a theory for the dissipation in terms of the imposed diabatic heat sources. For a moist atmosphere, the difficulties in quantifying irreversible moist processes or the value of the condensation temperature have so far frustrated efforts to construct a theory of dissipation. With this complication in mind, one of the goals here is to investigate the predictive power of the budget of dry entropy (i.e., the heat capacity times the logarithm of potential temperature).             Toward this end, the dry-entropy budget is derived for an atmosphere with realistic heat capacities and a solid-water phase, features that were absent from some previous studies of atmospheric entropy. It is shown that the dry-entropy budget may be interpreted as the sum of sources and sinks from six processes, which are, in order of decreasing magnitude, radiative cooling, condensation heating, sensible heating at the surface, wind-generated frictional dissipation, lifting of water, and transport of heat from the melting line to the upper troposphere. This picture leads to an alternative explanation for the low efficiency of the moist atmospheric engine.             Numerical simulations are presented from a new cloud-resolving model, Das Atmosph\"arische Modell, which was designed to conserve energy and close the dry-entropy budget. Simulations with and without subgrid diffusion of heat and water are compared to investigate the impact of subgrid parameterizations on the terms in the dry-entropy budget. The numerical results suggest a particularly simple parameterization of wind-generated dissipation that appears to be valid for changes in sea surface temperature and mean wind. The dry-entropy budget also points to various changes in forcings and parameterizations that could be expected to increase or decrease the wind-generated dissipation.},

It is found that the convective flux of undiluted parcels decays with height exponentially, indicating a constant probability per vertical distance of mixing with environmental air. This probability per distance is sufficiently large that undiluted updrafts are negligible above a height of 4\textendash 5 km and virtually absent above 10 km. These results are shown to be independent of the horizontal grid size within the range of 3.2 km to 100 m. Plumes that do reach the tropopause are found to be highly diluted.             An equivalent potential temperature is defined that is exactly conserved for all reversible adiabatic transformations, including those with ice. Using this conserved variable, it is shown that the latent heat of fusion (from both freezing and deposition) causes only a small increase in the level of neutral buoyancy near the tropopause. In fact, when taken to sufficiently low pressures, a parcel with an ice phase ends up colder than it would without an ice phase. Nevertheless, the contribution from fusion to a parcel's kinetic energy is quite large.             Using an ensemble of tracers, information is encoded in parcels at the cloud base and decoded where the parcel is observed in the free troposphere. Using this technique, clouds at the tropopause are diagnosed for their cloud-base temperature, specific humidity, and vertical velocity. Using these as the initial values for a Lagrangian parcel model, it is shown that fusion provides the kinetic energy required for diluted parcels to reach the tropopause.},

There are many properties of convection that can change as the atmosphere warms, each of which could produce deviations from CC scaling.

It is found that neither method is able to capture the two different time scales present in the full 3D equations. Nevertheless, WPG is argued to have several advantages over WTG. First, WPG correctly predicts the magnitude of the steady-state buoyancy anomalies generated by an applied heating, but WTG underestimates these buoyancy anomalies. It is conjectured that this underestimation may short-circuit the natural feedbacks between convective mass fluxes and local temperature anomalies. Second, WPG correctly predicts the adiabatic lifting of air below an initial buoyancy perturbation; WTG is unable to capture this nonlocal effect. It is hypothesized that this may be relevant to moist convection, where adiabatic lifting can reduce convective inhibition. Third, WPG agrees with the full 3D equations on the counterintuitive fact that an isolated heating applied to a column of Boussinesq fluid leads to a steady ascent with zero column-integrated buoyancy. This falsifies the premise of the relaxed form of WTG, which assumes that vertical velocity is proportional to buoyancy.},

  abstract = {Abstract             An analytical model is derived for tropical relative humidity using only the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation, hydrostatic balance, and a bulk-plume water budget. This theory is constructed for radiative\textendash convective equilibrium and compared against a cloud-resolving model. With some reinterpretation of variables, it can be applied more generally to the entire tropics.             Given four variables\textemdash pressure, temperature, and the fractional entrainment and detrainment rates\textemdash the equations predict the relative humidity (RH) and the temperature lapse rate analytically. The RH is a simple ratio involving the fractional detrainment rate and the water-vapor lapse rate. When integrated upward in height, the equations give profiles of RH and temperature for a convecting atmosphere.             The theory explains the magnitude of RH and the ``C'' shape of the tropospheric RH profile. It also predicts that RH is an invariant function of temperature as the atmosphere warms, and this behavior matches what has been seen in global climate models and what is demonstrated here with cloud-resolving simulations. Extending the theory to include the evaporation of hydrometeors, a lower bound is derived for the precipitation efficiency (PE) at each height: PE \&gt; 1 - RH. In a cloud-resolving simulation, this constraint is obeyed with the PE profile taking the shape of an inverted C shape.},

In the calculation of a dry convecting parcel, conservation of MSE minus CAPE gives the same answer as conservation of entropy and potential temperature, while the use of MSE alone can generate large errors. For a moist parcel, entropy and equivalent potential temperature give the same answer as MSE minus CAPE only if the parcel ascends in thermodynamic equilibrium. If the parcel ascends with a nonisothermal mixed-phase stage, these methods can give significantly different answers for the parcel buoyancy because MSE minus CAPE is conserved, while entropy and equivalent potential temperature are not.},

Using a streamfunction to define natural boundaries for these thermals, the dominant balance in the vertical momentum equation is revealed. Cloud thermals rise with a nearly constant speed determined by their buoyancy and the standard drag law with a drag coefficient of 0.6. Contrary to suggestions that cloud thermals might be slippery, with a dominant balance between buoyancy and acceleration, cloud thermals are found here to be sticky, with a dominant balance between buoyancy and drag.},

Unlike previous analytic expressions, some of which can have errors as high as hundreds or thousands of meters, this exact expression is accurate to within the uncertainty of empirical vapor pressure measurements: this translates into an uncertainty of around 5 m for all temperatures and relative humidities. An exact, explicit, analytic expression for the lifting deposition level (LDL) is also derived, and its behavior is compared to the LCL. At sufficiently cold temperatures, aerosols freeze homogeneously below the LCL; an approximate, implicit, analytic expression is given for this lifting freezing level (LFL).

Stable partial snow and ice cover on such a planet would be in the form of a belt about the equator rather than polar caps. An analytical model of planetary climate is used to investigate the stability of ice caps and ice belts over the widest possible range of parameters. The model is a non-dimensional diffusive Energy Balance Model, representing insolation, heat transport, and ice-albedo feedback on a spherical planet. A complete analytical solution for any obliquity is given and validated against numerical solutions of a seasonal model in the ``deep-water'' regime of weak seasonal ice line migration. Multiple equilibria and unstable transitions between climate states (ice-free, Snowball, or ice cap/belt) are found over wide swaths of parameter space, including a ``Large Ice-Belt Instability'' and ``Small Ice-Belt Instability'' at high obliquity. The Snowball catastrophe is avoided at weak radiative forcing in two different scenarios: weak albedo feedback and inefficient heat transport (favoring stable partial ice cover), or efficient transport at high obliquity (favoring ice-free conditions). From speculative assumptions about distributions of planetary parameters, three-fourths to four-fifths of all planets with stable partial ice cover should be in the form of Earth-like polar caps.},

We quantify the evolution of the gradient and of mid-latitude moisture both in a new compilation of Holocene palaeoclimate records spanning from 10\textdegree ~S to 90\textdegree ~N and in an ensemble of mid-Holocene climate model simulations. The observed pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that a weaker temperature gradient led to weaker mid-latitude westerly flow, weaker cyclones and decreased net terrestrial mid-latitude precipitation. Currently, the northern high latitudes are warming at rates nearly double the global average4, decreasing the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient to values comparable with those in the early to middle Holocene. If the patterns observed during the Holocene hold for current anthropogenically forced warming, the weaker latitudinal temperature gradient will lead to considerable reductions in mid-latitude water resources.},

Here, the role of the Antarctic surface height for meridional heat transport and local radiative feedbacks, including the surface albedo feedback, was investigated based on CO\textsubscript{2}-doubling experiments in a low-resolution coupled climate model. When Antarctica was assumed to be flat, the north\textendash south asymmetry of the zonal mean top of the atmosphere radiation budget was notably reduced. Doubling CO\textsubscript{2} in a flat Antarctica (flat AA) model setup led to a stronger increase in southern hemispheric poleward atmospheric and oceanic heat transport compared to the base model setup. Based on partial radiative perturbation (PRP) computations, it was shown that local radiative feedbacks and an increase in the CO\textsubscript{2} forcing in the deeper atmospheric column also contributed to stronger Antarctic warming in the flat AA model setup, and the roles of the individual radiative feedbacks are discussed in some detail. A considerable fraction (between 24 and 80 \% for three consecutive 25-year time slices starting in year 51 and ending in year 126 after CO\textsubscript{2} doubling) of the polar amplification asymmetry was explained by the difference in surface height, but the fraction was subject to transient changes and might to some extent also depend on model uncertainties. In order to arrive at a more reliable estimate of the role of land height for the observed polar amplification asymmetry, additional studies based on ensemble runs from higher-resolution models and an improved model setup with a more realistic gradual increase in the CO\textsubscript{2} concentration are required.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The framework is used to study the feedbacks among soil, boundary layer, and diurnal convection. It includes a setup with explicit convection and a full set of parameterizations. Predicted variables are constantly relaxed toward prescribed atmospheric profiles and soil conditions. The relaxation is weak in the lower troposphere and upper soil to allow the development of a realistic diurnal planetary boundary layer. The model is run to its own equilibrium (30 days).             The framework is able to produce a realistic timing of the diurnal cycle of convection. It also confirms the development of deeper convection in a more unstably stratified atmosphere.             With this relaxation method, the simulated ``diurnal equilibrium convection'' determines the humidity profile of the lower atmosphere, and the simulation becomes insensitive to the reference humidity profile. However, if a faster relaxation time is used in the lower troposphere, the convection and rainfall become much more sensitive to the reference humidity, consistent with previous studies.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting climate change have recently acquired a sense of urgency with the advent of serious climate-related food shortages and with the realization that human activities may have an influence on climate. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive theory of climate to explain its variability, nor are there physical models that can adequately simulate the climate system. Hence there is a serious need for the development of quantitative mathematical models of climate, first to derive better understanding and ultimately to allow some degree of predictive capability. Many modeling approaches are available, ranging from simple one-dimensional representation of the vertical radiative processes in the atmosphere up to very complex mathematical systems that describe the three-dimensional behavior of the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean along with the chemical and thermodynamical processes that control the hydrological cycle and the existence of sea ice. Since the simpler models isolate the important physical processes that determine the climate, we weigh our discussion more heavily toward these but also discuss many aspects of the more complex models. We try to stress the fundamental physical basis of each kind of model and its contribution to the understanding of the simultaneous interactions (or feedbacks) of the many coupled processes that determine the climate. One difficulty in predicting climate change is the large degree of cancellation that occurs between many of the climatic feedback mechanisms. Considerable discussion is included of the applications of theories of baroclinic disturbances to the parameterization of eddy heat fluxes. Also stressed are basic energy balance approaches to the calculation of the surface temperature. Finally, we give our view of the future of climate modeling and argue that a flexible plan that vigorously pursues many avenues of approach is preferable. Although this review is often critical, we hope that it serves (1) to illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of climate simulation modeling and (2) to clarify the relative importance of individual contributions to the broader problems of understanding and (ultimately) predicting climate change.},

In warmer climates, the convective lapse rate does affect the extratropical thermal stratification, but the effect is still smaller than would be expected if moist convection alone controlled the thermal stratification. A theory for how large-scale eddies modify the thermal stratification of dry atmospheres is consistent with the simulation results for colder climates. For warmer and moister climates, however, theories and heuristics that have been proposed to account for the extratropical thermal stratification are not consistent with the simulation results. Theories for the extratropical thermal stratification will generally have to take transport of sensible and latent heat by large-scale eddies into account, but moist convection may only need to be taken into account regionally and in sufficiently warm climates.},

  abstract = {Discussions of countering global warming with solar geoengineering assume that warming owing to rising greenhouse-gas concentrations can be compensated by artificially reducing the amount of sunlight Earth absorbs. However, solar geoengineering may not be fail-safe to prevent global warming because CO2 can directly affect cloud cover: It reduces cloud cover by modulating the longwave radiative cooling within the atmosphere. This effect is not mitigated by solar geoengineering. Here, we use idealized high-resolution simulations of clouds to show that, even under a sustained solar geoengineering scenario with initially only modest warming, subtropical stratocumulus clouds gradually thin and may eventually break up into scattered cumulus clouds, at concentrations exceeding 1,700 parts per million (ppm). Because stratocumulus clouds cover large swaths of subtropical oceans and cool Earth by reflecting incident sunlight, their loss would trigger strong (about 5 K) global warming. Thus, the results highlight that, at least in this extreme and idealized scenario, solar geoengineering may not suffice to counter greenhouse-gas-driven global warming.},

State-of-the-art satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis consistently reveal an enhancement of summer Arctic monthly OLR cooling ranging 1.5\textendash 4 W m-2 during months with anomalously high thermodynamic advection. This cooling anomaly is found to be of the same magnitude or slightly larger than associated downwelling LW surface warming anomalies. We identify a relationship between large-scale circulation variability and changing cloud properties permitting LW radiation at both the surface and top of the atmosphere to respond to variability in atmospheric thermodynamics. Driven by anomalous advection of warm air, the corresponding enhanced OLR cooling signal on monthly time scales represents an important buffer to regional Arctic warming.},

  abstract = {Abstract             How will warming temperatures influence thunderstorm severity? This question can be explored by using climate models to diagnose changes in large-scale convective instability (CAPE) and wind shear, conditions that are known to be conducive to the formation of severe thunderstorms. First, an ensemble of climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is evaluated on its ability to reproduce a radiosonde climatology of such storm-favorable conditions in the current climate's spring and summer seasons, focusing on the contiguous United States (CONUS). Of the 11 climate models evaluated, a high-performing subset of four (GFDL CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM1-M) is identified. Second, the twenty-first-century changes in the frequency of environments favorable to severe thunderstorms are calculated in these high-performing models as they are forced by the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions pathways. For the RCP8.5 scenario, the models predict consistent CONUS-mean fractional springtime increases in the range of 50\%\textendash 180\% by the end of the twenty-first century; for the summer, three of the four models predict increases in the range of 40\%\textendash 120\% and one model predicts a small decrease. This disagreement between the models is traced to divergent projections for future CAPE and boundary layer humidity in the Great Plains. This paper also explores the sensitivity of the results to the relative weight given to wind shear in determining how ``favorable'' a large-scale environment is for the development of severe thunderstorms, and it is found that this weighting is not the dominant source of uncertainty in projections of future thunderstorm severity.},

Here the first cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium designed to contain only these basic ingredients are presented. This setup does not produce a FAT: the anvil temperature varies by about 40\% of the surface temperature range. However, the tropopause temperature varies by only 4\% of the surface temperature range, which supports the existence of a Fixed Tropopause Temperature (FiTT). In full-complexity radiative-convective equilibrium simulations, the spread in anvil temperature is smaller by about a factor of 2, but the tropopause temperature remains more invariant than the anvil temperature by an order of magnitude. In other words, our simulations have a FiTT, not a FAT.},

The conventional paradigm for these clouds attributes their existence to the rapidly declining convective mass flux below the tropopause, which implies a large source of detraining cloudy air there. Here we test this paradigm by manipulating the sources and sinks of cloudy air in cloud-resolving simulations. We find that anvils form in our simulations because of the long lifetime of upper-tropospheric cloud condensates, not because of an enhanced source of cloudy air below the tropopause. We further show that cloud lifetimes are long in the cold upper troposphere because the saturation specific humidity is much smaller there than the condensed water loading of cloudy updrafts, which causes evaporative cloud decay to act very slowly. Our results highlight the need for novel cloud-fraction schemes that align with this decay-centric framework for anvil clouds.},

As an example, we use the warm-rain formation by collision-coalescence, that is, the parameterization of autoconversion, accretion, and self-collection of droplets in a two-moment framework. Benchmark solutions of the kinetic collection equations are performed using a Monte Carlo superdroplet algorithm. The superdroplet method provides reliable but noisy estimates of the warm-rain process rates. For each process rate, a neural network is trained using standard machine learning techniques. The resulting models make skillful predictions for the process rates when compared to the testing data. However, when solving the ordinary differential equations, the solutions are not as good as those of an established warm-rain parameterization. This deficiency can be seen as a limitation of the machine learning methods that are applied, but at the same time, it points toward a fundamental ill-posedness of the commonly used two-moment warm-rain schemes. More advanced machine learning methods that include a notion of time derivatives, therefore, have the potential to overcome these problems.},

Assessment of the atmospheric budget relies primarily on the ERA-40 reanalysis. The seasonal cycles of vertically integrated atmospheric energy storage and the convergence of energy transport from ERA-40, as evaluated for the polar cap (defined by the 70\textdegree N latitude circle), in general compare well with realizations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis over the period 1979\textendash 2001. However, shortcomings in top of atmosphere radiation, as compared to satellite data, and the net surface flux, contribute to large energy budget residuals in ERA-40. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric energy storage is strongly modulated by the net surface flux, which is also the primary driver of seasonal changes in heat storage within the Arctic Ocean. Averaged for an Arctic Ocean domain, the July net surface flux from ERA-40 of -100 W m-2 (i.e., into the ocean), associated with sea ice melt and oceanic sensible heat gain, exceeds the atmospheric energy transport convergence of 91 W m-2. During winter (for which budget residuals are large), oceanic sensible heat loss and sea ice growth yield an upward surface flux of 50\textendash 60 W m-2, complemented with an atmospheric energy convergence of 80\textendash 90 W m-2 to provide a net radiation loss to space of 175\textendash 180 W m-2.},

In reanalysis data, the winter-to-summer transition involves the growth of planetary-scale wave latent heat and momentum transports in the region of monsoons and anticyclones that dominate over the zonal-mean transport beginning in midspring. The wave-dominated regime coincides with an abrupt northward expansion of the cross-equatorial circulation and reversal of the trade winds. In the upper troposphere, the transition coincides with the growth of cross-equatorial planetary-scale wave momentum transport and a poleward shift of subplanetary-scale wave transport and jet stream.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The dynamics of the seasonal transition are captured by idealized aquaplanet model simulations with a prescribed subtropical planetary-scale wave sea surface temperature (SST) perturbation. The SST perturbation generates subtropical planetary-scale wave streamfunction variance and transport in the lower and upper troposphere consistent with quasigeostrophic theory. Beyond a threshold SST, a transition of the zonal-mean circulation occurs, which coincides with a localized reversal of absolute vorticity in the NH tropical upper troposphere. The transition is abrupt in the lower troposphere because of the quadratic dependence of the wave transport on the SST perturbation and involves seasonal-time-scale feedbacks between the wave and zonal-mean flow in the upper troposphere, including cross-equatorial wave propagation. The zonal-mean vertical and meridional flows associated with the circulation response are in balance with the planetary-scale wave momentum and latent heat meridional flux divergences. The results highlight the leading-order role of monsoon\textendash anticyclone transport in the seasonal transition, including its impact on the meridional extent of the Hadley and Ferrel cells.

Here we show the ITCZ shifts southward in response to a zonally asymmetric forcing in the Northern Hemisphere subtropics in a slab ocean aquaplanet model. The southward shift is consistent with decreased zonal mean energy input to the atmosphere due to cloud radiative effect changes in the cooling region. When cloud-radiative feedbacks are disabled the ITCZ shifts northward consistent with changes in the warming region where increased energy input via surface heat fluxes and stationary Rossby-wave transport dominate. Competition between cooling and warming regions leads to changes in gross moist stability. Our results show rectification of zonally asymmetric forcings play an important role in zonal mean ITCZ dynamics and highlight the importance of assessing the momentum budget when interpreting ITCZ shifts.},

In state-of-the-art climate models, the average response of the Asian monsoon cyclone, Pacific ocean anticyclone and jet stream to global warming is weak and responses of different models are diverse. Here we use a suite of simulations with atmospheric general circulation models with prescribed sea surface temperatures to separate the circulation responses to direct radiative forcing and indirect sea surface temperature warming. We find that the two contributions oppose each other. Using idealized aquaplanet simulations, we show that the different circulation responses are directly connected to the opposite responses of land\textendash sea thermal contrast to the two forcing components. This tug of war on the circulation response to global warming is analogous to the seasonal response to insolation, which involves opposite land\textendash sea thermal contrasts and circulation patterns governed by quasi-equilibrium thermodynamics and stationary-wave dynamics. We conclude that it is important to distinguish weak circulation responses to global warming that arise owing to compensating effects that are robust and physically understood from those that are associated with genuine uncertainty. We note that compensation places fundamental limits on the detection and attribution of circulation responses to global warming.},

Here the response to direct radiative forcing is decomposed into increased CO2 over ocean and land using an AGCM with spatially dependent CO2. The land versus ocean response is mostly linear. Consistent with previous work, ocean direct radiative forcing decreases ocean-averaged outgoing longwave radiation, precipitation, and tropical circulation intensity; however, it cannot explain the regional response to direct radiative forcing. Increased CO2 over land dominates the regional response via energy input over land, e.g., over deserts where there is no cloud and water vapor masking and a Rossby wave teleconnection. This mechanism operates across a range of climate perturbations, including decreased CO2. Previous AGCM decompositions involving direct radiative forcing and indirect sea surface temperature warming must be reinterpreted to include the importance of increased CO2 over land.},

Here we test latitudinally dependent explanations of the circulation response to increased CO2 using slab ocean aquaplanet models with latitudinally dependent CO2 concentration. Quadrupling CO2 in the tropics (0\textendash 20\textdegree ) accounts for the strengthening and upward shift of the subtropical jet but does not account for the poleward shift of the Hadley cell edge or extratropical circulation. The tropical response is dominated by regions of descent. When CO2 is quadrupled in high latitudes (60\textendash 90\textdegree ), there is a negligible circulation response. The response to latitudinally dependent increased CO2 is mostly linear and increased CO2 in the midlatitudes (20\textendash 60\textdegree ) dominates. Within the midlatitudes, the subtropics (20\textendash 40\textdegree ) dominate.

The mechanisms are grouped according to their thermodynamic starting point, which are thought to arise from processes independent of the zonal mean mid-latitude circulation response. There are 24 mechanisms and 8 thermodynamic starting points: (i) increased latent heat release aloft in the tropics, (ii) increased dry static stability and tropopause height outside the tropics, (iii) radiative cooling of the stratosphere, (iv) Hadley cell expansion, (v) increased specific humidity following the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, (vi) cloud radiative effect changes, (vii) turbulent surface heat flux changes, and (viii) decreased surface meridional temperature gradient. I argue progress can be made by testing the thermodynamic starting points. I review recent tests of the increased latent heat release aloft in the tropics starting point, i.e., prescribing diabatic perturbations, quantifying the transient response to an abrupt CO2 increase and imposing latitudinally dependent CO2 concentration. Finally, I provide a future outlook for improving our understanding of predicted changes in the zonal mean mid-latitude circulation.},

Previous work explained the weak North Atlantic storm track during the Last Glacial Maximum using dry zonally asymmetric mechanisms associated with orographic forcing. Here we show that zonally symmetric mechanisms associated with the hydrological cycle explain the weak Snowball Earth storm track. The weak storm track is consistent with the decreased meridional gradient of evaporation and atmospheric shortwave absorption and can be predicted following global mean cooling and the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The weak storm track is also consistent with decreased latent heat release aloft in the tropics, which decreases upper tropospheric baroclinicity and mean available potential energy. Overall, both hydrological cycle mechanisms are reflected in the significant correlation between storm track intensity and the meridional surface moist static energy gradient across a range of simulated climates between modern and Snowball Earth.},

  abstract = {Key climate feedback due to water vapor and clouds rest largely on how relative humidity {$\mathscr{R}$} changes in a warmer climate, yet this has not been extensively analyzed in models. General circulation models (GCMs) from the CMIP3 archive and several higher-resolution atmospheric GCMs examined here generally predict a characteristic pattern of {$\mathscr{R}$} trend with global temperature that has been reported previously in individual models, including increase around the tropopause, decrease in the tropical upper troposphere, and decrease in midlatitudes. This pattern is very similar to that previously reported for cloud cover in the same GCMs, confirming the role of {$\mathscr{R}$} in controlling changes in simulated cloud. Comparing different models, the trend in each part of the troposphere is approximately proportional to the upward and/or poleward gradient of {$\mathscr{R}$} in the present climate. While this suggests that the changes simply reflect a shift of the {$\mathscr{R}$} pattern upward with the tropopause and poleward with the zonal jets, the drying trend in the subtropics is roughly 3 times too large to be attributable to shifts of subtropical features, and the subtropical {$\mathscr{R}$} minima deepen in most models. {$\mathscr{R}$} trends are correlated with horizontal model resolution, especially outside the tropics, where they show signs of convergence and latitudinal gradients become close to available observations for GCM resolutions near T85 and higher. We argue that much of the systematic change in {$\mathscr{R}$} can be explained by the local specific humidity having been set (by condensation) in remote regions with different temperature changes, hence the gradients and trends each depend on a model's ability to resolve moisture transport. Finally, subtropical drying trends predicted from the warming alone fall well short of those observed in recent decades. While this discrepancy supports previous reports of GCMs underestimating Hadley cell expansion, our results imply that shifts alone are not a sufficient interpretation of changes.},

Clim. 21 5336\textendash 52). This method, in effect, performs a multiple linear regression of the data onto a structural model that includes both natural variability, trends, and time-changing instrument biases, thereby avoiding estimation biases inherent in traditional homogenization methods. One modification now enables homogenized winds to be provided for the first time. This, and several other small modifications made to the original method sometimes affect results at individual stations, but do not strongly affect broad-scale temperature trends. Temperature trends in the updated data show three noteworthy features. First, tropical warming is equally strong over both the 1959\textendash 2012 and 1979\textendash 2012 periods, increasing smoothly and almost moist-adiabatically from the surface (where it is roughly 0.14 K/decade) to 300 hPa (where it is about 0.25 K/decade over both periods), a pattern very close to that in climate model predictions. This contradicts suggestions that atmospheric warming has slowed in recent decades or that it has not kept up with that at the surface. Second, as shown in previous studies, tropospheric warming does not reach quite as high in the tropics and subtropics as predicted in typical models. Third, cooling has slackened in the stratosphere such that linear trends since 1979 are about half as strong as reported earlier for shorter periods. Wind trends over the period 1979\textendash 2012 confirm a strengthening, lifting and poleward shift of both subtropical westerly jets; the Northern one shows more displacement and the southern more intensification, but these details appear sensitive to the time period analysed. There is also a trend toward more easterly winds in the middle and upper troposphere of the deep tropics.},

The importance of the upward shift is well known, but its physical basis and the extent to which it occurs coherently across variables are not well understood. A transformation is derived here that shows how an upward shift of a solution to the moist primitive equations gives a new approximate solution with higher tropospheric temperatures. According to the transformation, all variables shift upward with warming but with an additional modification to the temperature and a general weakening of the pressure velocity. The applicability of the vertical-shift transformation is explored using a hierarchy of models from adiabatic parcel ascents to comprehensive GCMs. The transformation is found to capture many features of the response to climate change in simulations with an idealized GCM, including the mid- and upper-tropospheric changes in lapse rate, relative humidity, and meridional wind. The transformation is less accurate when applied to simulations with more realistic GCMs, but it nonetheless captures some important features. Deviations from the simulated response are primarily due to the surface boundary conditions, which do not necessarily conform to the transformation, especially in the case of the zonal winds. The results allow for a physical interpretation of the upward shift in terms of the governing equations and suggest that it may be thought of as a coherent response of the general circulation of the mid- and upper troposphere.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The updraught velocities increase with warming, with the largest fractional increases occurring in the upper troposphere and for the highest percentile updraughts. A plume model approximately reproduces the increases in updraught velocities if the plume environment is prescribed as the mean profile in each simulation while holding the entrainment and microphysical assumptions fixed. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) also increases with warming in the simulations but at a much faster fractional rate when compared with the square of the updraught velocities. This discrepancy is investigated with a two-plume model in which a weakly entraining plume represents the most intense updraughts, and the environment is assumed to adjust so that a more strongly entraining plume has negligible buoyancy. The two-plume model suggests that updraught velocities increase with warming at a lower fractional rate than implied by the CAPE because of the influence of entrainment on both the mean stratification and the updraughts themselves.},

Imposing this pattern of perturbed OHFC in a global climate model results in a poleward shift in ocean-to-atmosphere turbulent heat fluxes (both sensible and latent) and sea ice retreat; the high latitudes warm, while the midlatitudes cool, thereby amplifying polar warming. Furthermore, midlatitude cooling is propagated to the polar midtroposphere on isentropic surfaces, augmenting the (positive) lapse rate feedback at high latitudes. These results highlight the key role played by the partitioning of meridional energy transport changes between the atmosphere and ocean in high-latitude climate change.},

  abstract = {A simple steady-state model for the thermodynamic structure of a convecting atmosphere under the influence of large-scale dynamics is derived based on a bulk-plume representation of convection. Given profiles of the large-scale vertical velocity and convective mass flux, the model predicts the steady-state temperature and environmental relative humidity profiles as a function of the convective entrainment rate and a parameter representing the importance of condensate reevaporation. The bulk-plume model determines the environmental relative humidity through a balance between the moistening effect of convective detrainment and the drying effect of subsidence in the cloud environment. As the convective mass flux is increased, the importance of detrainment moistening increases, leading to a higher environmental relative humidity. Since the precipitation rate also increases with the convective mass flux, this leads to a steady state in which the precipitation is a strongly increasing function of environmental relative humidity. The bulk-plume model also predicts that the atmospheric stability increases with large-scale upward motion, with the tropospheric lapse rate being most unstable under large-scale descent, when the environmental relative humidity is low. The above relationships are reproduced in a set of simulations with a cloud-system resolving model (CRM) run to equilibrium with imposed large-scale vertical velocity profiles. The results provide insight to the steady-state limit of the well-known problem of determining the relationships between large-scale conditions and the convective state of the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Theories for the position and intensity of precipitation over tropical oceans on climate time scales have a perplexing disagreement between those that focus on the momentum budget of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and those that focus on thermodynamic factors. In the case of narrow intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs), there is some evidence for both classes of theories, and there are large open questions on the interpretation of the moist static energy (MSE) and momentum budgets of these regions. We develop a model in which both types of mechanisms can operate and the interaction between them can be analyzed. The model includes a mixed-layer ABL, coupled to a free troposphere whose vertical structure follows the quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation model (QTCM) of Neelin and Zeng. The case analyzed here is axisymmetric, using a fixed sea surface temperature (SST) lower boundary condition with an idealized off-equatorial SST maximum. We examine a regime with small values of the gross moist stability associated with tropospheric motions, which is realistic but poses theoretical challenges. In both rotating (equatorial {$\beta$}-plane) and nonrotating cases, the model ITCZ width and intensity are substantially controlled by the horizontal diffusion of moisture, which is hypothesized to be standing in for nonaxisymmetric transients. The inclusion of the ABL increases the amplitude and sharpness of the ITCZ, contributing to the importance of diffusion. Analytical solutions under simplifying assumptions show that the ABL contribution is not singular in the nondiffusive limit; it just features an ITCZ more intense than observed. A negative gross moist stability contribution associated with the flow component driven by ABL momentum dynamics plays a large role in this. Because of the ABL contribution, the flow imports, rather than exports, MSE in the ITCZ, but we show that this can be understood rather simply. The ABL contribution can be approximately viewed as a forcing to the tropospheric thermodynamics. The ABL forcing term is in addition to thermodynamic forcing by net flux terms in the MSE budget, which otherwise is much as in the standard QTCM. The ABL momentum budget suggests that divergent flow in the ABL is controlled to a significant extent by the pressure gradient imprinted on the ABL by the SST gradient\textemdash termed the Lindzen\textendash Nigam contribution\textemdash although we also find that the thermodynamics mediating this is nontrivial, especially in the rotating case. Nonetheless, when this component of the pressure gradient is artificially removed, the peak ITCZ precipitation is reduced by a fraction on the order of 15 to 25\%, less than might have been expected based on the diagnosis of the ABL momentum budget.},

Previous studies have focused on the changes of subtropical highs during their peak season (June\textendash August)6\textendash 8, but little is known about their changes in other seasons. Here, a suite of multi-model simulations are used to demonstrate the robust seasonally dependent responses of subtropical highs and tropical rainfall to anthropogenic warming. The zonal-mean subtropical highs in the Northern Hemisphere are shown to strengthen more during April\textendash June than July\textendash September, with opposite responses for the Southern Hemisphere counterparts. These responses are closely related to a southward shift of tropical rainfall in April\textendash June relative to July\textendash September, manifesting in a seasonal delay of tropical rainfall and monsoon onset in the Northern Hemisphere9,10. Such seasonality is found to occur in response to elevated latent energy demand in the hemisphere warming up seasonally, as dictated by the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation. The interhemispheric energy contrast drives a southward shift of tropical rainfall that strengthens the Hadley cell and zonal-mean subtropical highs in the Northern Hemisphere in April\textendash June relative to July\textendash September. These changes scale linearly with warming, with increasing implications for projecting climate changes in the tropics and subtropics as warming continues.},

If one can predict the climatic response to perturbations in incident radiation, one can, therefore, test the Milankovitch theory by comparing the predicted climatic changes with those inferred from the geological record. No other theory of the ice ages admits such a straightforward check on its validity.

Additionally, the common practice of representing boundary-layer turbulence, shallow convection, and deep convection by discontinuously different parameterizations schemes, each with its own set of parameters, has contributed to the proliferation of adjustable parameters in large-scale models. Here we lay the theoretical foundations for an extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme that has explicit time-dependence and memory of subgrid-scale variables and is designed to represent all subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, from boundary layer dynamics to deep convection, in a unified manner. Coherent up and downdrafts in the scheme are represented as prognostic plumes that interact with their environment and potentially with each other through entrainment and detrainment. The more isotropic turbulence in their environment is represented through diffusive fluxes, with diffusivities obtained from a turbulence kinetic energy budget that consistently partitions turbulence kinetic energy between plumes and environment. The cross-sectional area of up and downdrafts satisfies a prognostic continuity equation, which allows the plumes to cover variable and arbitrarily large fractions of a large-scale grid box and to have life cycles governed by their own internal dynamics. Relatively simple preliminary proposals for closure parameters are presented and are shown to lead to a successful simulation of shallow convection, including a time-dependent life cycle.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive climate models exhibit a large spread in the magnitude of projected poleward eddy-driven jet shift in response to warming. The spread has been connected to the radiative response to warming. To understand how different radiative assumptions alone affect the jet shift in response to warming, we introduce a new clear-sky longwave radiation hierarchy that spans idealized (gray versus four bands; without or with interactive water vapor) through comprehensive (correlated-k) radiation in the same general circulation model. The new hierarchy is used in an aquaplanet configuration to explore the impact of radiation on the jet stream response to warming, independent of mean surface temperature and meridional surface temperature gradient responses. The gray radiation scheme produces a split jet and its eddy-driven jet shifts equatorward as climate warms, whereas the storm track shifts equatorward then poleward. Including four longwave bands leads to a merged jet that shifts slightly poleward with warming, and the storm track shifts monotonically poleward. Including interactive water vapor makes the poleward jet shift comparable to the jet shift with comprehensive radiation and interactive water vapor. These jet and storm track differences are linked to the radiation response of the stratospheric temperature, the tropopause height, and the meridional gradient of the radiative forcing to warming. Dynamically, the equatorward jet shift with the gray scheme is consistent with reduced wave reflection on the poleward flank of the jet, whereas the poleward jet shift with the other schemes is consistent with increased eddy length scale that favors equatorward wave propagation.},

  abstract = {Forty years ago, climate scientists predicted the Arctic to be one of Earth's most sensitive climate regions and thus extremely vulnerable to increased CO2. The rapid and unprecedented changes observed in the Arctic confirm this prediction. Especially significant, observed sea ice loss is altering the exchange of mass, energy, and momentum between the Arctic Ocean and atmosphere. As an important component of air\textendash sea exchange, surface turbulent fluxes are controlled by vertical gradients of temperature and humidity between the surface and atmosphere, wind speed, and surface roughness, indicating that they respond to other forcing mechanisms such as atmospheric advection, ocean mixing, and radiative flux changes. The exchange of energy between the atmosphere and surface via surface turbulent fluxes in turn feeds back on the Arctic surface energy budget, sea ice, clouds, boundary layer temperature and humidity, and atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Understanding and attributing variability and trends in surface turbulent fluxes is important because they influence the magnitude of Arctic climate change, sea ice cover variability, and the atmospheric circulation response to increased CO2. This paper reviews current knowledge of Arctic Ocean surface turbulent fluxes and their effects on climate. We conclude that Arctic Ocean surface turbulent fluxes are having an increasingly consequential influence on Arctic climate variability in response to strong regional trends in the air-surface temperature contrast related to the changing character of the Arctic sea ice cover. Arctic Ocean surface turbulent energy exchanges are not smooth and steady but rather irregular and episodic, and consideration of the episodic nature of surface turbulent fluxes is essential for improving Arctic climate projections.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the possible response of the large-scale atmospheric structure to a warmer climate. Using integrations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in conjunction with physical arguments, we try to identify what changes are likely to be robust and what the underlying mechanisms might be. We focus on the large-scale zonally averaged circulation, in particular on height of the tropopause, the strength and position of the surface westerlies and the strength and extent of the Hadley Cell. We present analytic arguments and numerical calculations which suggest that under global warming the height of the tropopause will increase in both the transient response and final equilibrium state, and an increase is clearly found in all the comprehensive models in CMIP5. Upper stratospheric cooling is also found in the comprehensive models, and this too can be explained by a radiative argument. Regarding the circulation, most models show a slight expansion and weakening of the Hadley Cell, depending on season and hemisphere. The expansion is small and largely confined to winter but with some expansion in Southern Hemisphere summer. The weakening occurs principally in the Northern Hemisphere but the intermodel scatter is large. There is also a general polewards shift in surface westerlies, but the changes are small and again are little larger than the intermodel variability in the change. This shift is positively correlated with the Hadley Cell expansion to a degree that depends somewhat on the metric chosen for the latter. There is a robust strengthening in the Southern Hemisphere surface winds across seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a slight strengthening in the westerlies in most models in winter but a consistent weakening of the westerlies in summer. We present various physical arguments concerning these circulation changes but none that are both demonstrably correct and that account for the model results. We conclude that the above-mentioned large-scale thermodynamic/radiative changes in the large-scale atmospheric structure are generally robust, in the sense of being both well understood and consistently reproduced by comprehensive models. In that sense the dynamical changes are less robust given the current state of knowledge and simulation, although one cannot conclude that they are, in principle, unknowable or less predictable.},

  abstract = {The radiative and turbulent heat fluxes between the snow-covered sea ice and the atmosphere were analyzed on the basis of observations during the Ice Station Polarstern (ISPOL) in the western Weddell Sea from 28 November 2004 to 2 January 2005. The net heat flux to the snowpack was 3 {$\pm$} 2 W m-2 (mean {$\pm$} standard deviation; defined positive toward snow), consisting of the net shortwave radiation (52 {$\pm$} 8 W m-2), net longwave radiation (-29 {$\pm$} 4 W m-2), latent heat flux (-14 {$\pm$} 5 W m-2), and sensible heat flux (-6 {$\pm$} 5 W m-2). The snowpack receives heat at daytime while releases heat every night. Snow thinning was due to approximately equal contributions of the increase of snow density, melt, and evaporation. The surface albedo only decreased from 0.9 to 0.8. During a case of cold air advection, the sensible heat flux was even below -50 W m-2. At night, the snow surface temperature was strongly controlled by the incoming longwave radiation. The diurnal cycle in the downward solar radiation drove diurnal cycles in 14 other variables. Comparisons against observations from the Arctic sea ice in summer indicated that at ISPOL the air was colder, surface albedo was higher, and a larger portion of the absorbed solar radiation was returned to the atmosphere via turbulent heat fluxes. The limited melt allowed larger diurnal cycles. Due to regional differences in atmospheric circulation and ice conditions, the ISPOL results cannot be fully generalized for the entire Antarctic sea ice zone.},

In contrast to the Hadley cell of modern Earth, momentum transport by dry convection, which is modeled as vertical diffusion of momentum, is important in the upper branch of the snowball Earth Hadley cell. In the zonal momentum balance, mean meridional advection of mean absolute vorticity is not only balanced by eddies but also by vertical diffusion of zonal momentum. Vertical diffusion also contributes to the meridional momentum balance by decelerating the Hadley cell through downgradient mixing of meridional momentum between its upper and lower branches. When vertical diffusion of momentum is suppressed in the upper branch, the Hadley cell strengthens by a factor of about 2. This is in line with the effect of vertical diffusion in the meridional momentum balance but in contrast with its effect in the zonal momentum balance. Neither axisymmetric Hadley cell theories based on angular momentum conservation nor eddy-permitting Hadley cell theories that neglect vertical diffusion of momentum are applicable to the snowball Earth Hadley cell. Because the snowball Earth Hadley cell is a particular realization of a dry Hadley cell, these results show that an appropriate description of dry Hadley cells should take into account vertical transport of momentum by dry convection.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Most previous studies have quantified changes in total tropical width, focused on the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell or considered each hemisphere's response to a multitude of anthropogenic forcings. It is shown here that under exclusive CO2 forcing, climate models predict twice as much Hadley cell expansion in the Southern Hemisphere relative to the Northern Hemisphere. This asymmetry is present in the annual mean expansion and all seasons except boreal autumn. It is robust across models and Hadley cell edge definitions. It is surprising since asymmetries in simulated Hadley cell expansion are typically attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion or aerosol emission. Its primary cause is smaller sensitivity of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell to static stability changes. The pattern of sea surface warming and the CO2 direct radiative effect also contribute to the asymmetry.},

Here I investigate the representation of the global energy balance in 40 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the magnitudes of the energy balance components are often in better agreement with recent reference estimates compared to earlier model generations on a global mean basis. However, the inter-model spread in the representation of many of the components remains substantial, often on the order of 10\textendash 20 Wm-2 globally, except for aspects of the shortwave clear-sky budgets, which are now more consistently simulated by the CMIP6 models. The substantial inter-model spread in the simulated global mean latent heat fluxes in the CMIP6 models, exceeding 20\% (18~Wm-2), further implies also large discrepancies in their representation of the global water balance. From a historic perspective of model development over the past decades, the largest adjustments in the magnitudes of the simulated present-day global mean energy balance components occurred in the shortwave atmospheric clear-sky absorption and the surface downward longwave radiation. Both components were gradually adjusted upwards over several model generations, on the order of 10 Wm-2, to reach 73 and 344 Wm-2, respectively in the CMIP6 multi-model means. Thereby, CMIP6 has become the first model generation that largely remediates long-standing model deficiencies related to an overestimation in surface downward shortwave and compensational underestimation in downward longwave radiation in its multi-model mean.},

Consequently, the threshold for appearance of high clouds and associated radiative forcing shifts along with temperature. An excess entropy coordinate provides a reference to which the onset of deep convection is invariant, and gives a compact description of SST changes and cloud feedbacks suitable for diagnostics and as a basis for simplified climate models. The results underscore that the typically skewed appearance of tropical SST histograms, with a sharp drop-off above some threshold value, should not be taken as evidence for tropical thermostats.},

RCE is an idealization of the climate system in which there is a~balance between radiative cooling of the atmosphere and heating by convection. The scientific objectives of RCEMIP are three-fold. First, clouds and climate sensitivity will be investigated in the RCE setting. This includes determining how cloud fraction changes with warming and the role of self-aggregation of convection in climate sensitivity. Second, RCEMIP will quantify the dependence of the degree of convective aggregation and tropical circulation regimes on temperature. Finally, by providing a common baseline, RCEMIP will allow the robustness of the RCE state across the spectrum of models to be assessed, which is essential for interpreting the results found regarding clouds, climate sensitivity, and aggregation, and more generally, determining which features of tropical climate a RCE framework is useful for. A novel aspect and major advantage of RCEMIP is the accessibility of the RCE framework to a variety of models, including cloud-resolving models, general circulation models, global cloud-resolving models, single-column models, and large-eddy simulation models.},

The LTS can be regarded as a measure of the strength of the inversion that caps the planetary boundary layer (PBL). A stronger inversion is more effective at trapping moisture within the marine boundary layer (MBL), permitting greater cloud cover. This paper presents a new formulation, called the {$<$}em{$>$}estimated inversion strength{$<$}/em{$>$} (EIS), to estimate the strength of the PBL inversion given the temperatures at 700 hPa and at the surface. The EIS accounts for the general observation that the free-tropospheric temperature profile is often close to a moist adiabat and its lapse rate is strongly temperature dependent. Therefore, for a given LTS, the EIS is greater at colder temperatures. It is demonstrated that while the seasonal cycles of LTS and low cloud cover fraction (CF) are strongly correlated in many regions, no single relationship between LTS and CF can be found that encompasses the wide range of temperatures occurring in the Tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes. However, a single linear relationship between CF and EIS explains 83\% of the regional/seasonal variance in stratus cloud amount, suggesting that EIS is a more regime-independent predictor of stratus cloud amount than is LTS under a wide range of climatological conditions.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The result has some potentially important implications for how low clouds might behave in a changed climate. In contrast to Miller's thermostat hypothesis that a reduction in the lapse rate (Clausius\textendash Clapeyron) will lead to increased LTS and increased tropical low cloud cover in a warmer climate, the results here suggest that low clouds may be much less sensitive to changes in the temperature profile if the vertical profile of tropospheric warming follows a moist adiabat.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Using a Gaussian approximation for the distribution of equivalent potential temperature, the authors argue that the tropopause potential temperature is approximately given by the mean equivalent potential temperature at the surface plus twice its standard derivation. This relationship is motivated by the comparison of the meridional circulation on dry and moist isentropes. It is further tested using four reanalysis datasets: the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim); the NCEP\textendash Department of Energy (DOE) Reanalysis II; the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis; and the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR), version 2. The proposed relationship successfully captures the annual cycle of the tropopause for both hemispheres. The results are robust among different reanalysis datasets, albeit the 20CR tends to overestimate the tropopause potential temperature. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism also works well in obtaining the interannual variability (with climatological annual cycle removed) for Northern Hemisphere summer with an above-0.6 correlation across different reanalyses. On the contrary, this mechanism is rather weak in explaining the interannual variability in the Southern Hemisphere and no longer works for Northern Hemisphere wintertime. This work suggests the important role of the moist dynamics in determining the midlatitude tropopause.},

Results from ten CRMs are also used to diagnose problems in the SCMs. It is shown that most SCMs can generally capture well the convective events that were well-developed within the SCM domain, while most of them have difficulties in simulating the occurrence of those convective events that only occurred within a small part of the domain. All models significantly underestimate the surface stratiform precipitation. A third of them produce large errors in surface precipitation and thermodynamic structures. Deficiencies in convective triggering mechanisms are thought to be one of the major reasons. Using a triggering mechanism that is based on the vertical integral of parcel buoyant energy without additional appropriate constraints results in overactive convection, which in turn leads to large systematic warm/dry biases in the troposphere. It is also shown that a non-penetrative convection scheme can underestimate the depth of instability for midlatitude convection, which leads to large systematic cold/moist biases in the troposphere. SCMs agree well quantitatively with CRMs in the updraught mass fluxes, while most models significantly underestimate the downdraught mass fluxes. Neglect of mesoscale updraught and downdraught mass fluxes in the SCMs contributes considerably to the discrepancies between the SCMs and the CRMs. In addition, uncertainties in the diagnosed mass fluxes in the CRMs and deficiencies with cumulus parametrizations are not negligible. Similar results are obtained in the sensitivity tests when different forcing approaches are used. Finally, sensitivity tests from an SCM indicate that its simulations can be greatly improved when its triggering mechanism and closure assumption are improved. \textcopyright{} Royal Meteorological Society, 2002.

  abstract = {The vertical profiles and trends of temperature and humidity at the South Pole up to 10 km above mean sea level (amsl) were investigated by using radiosonde data collected from March 2005 to February 2018. During an average year between 2005 and 2018, the highest (lowest) temperature in the lower troposphere was approximately -25 \textdegree C (-60 \textdegree C) in December (July) at a height of about 500 m above the surface (at the surface). A temperature inversion layer above the surface was found during the whole year but was weaker during the summer, while the inversion layers at the tropopause (about 8 km amsl) mostly disappeared during spring and winter. General warming trends were found at all heights and months, but in a few heights and months cooling trends still occurred (e.g., in September below 7 km amsl). Nevertheless, seasonal and yearly averaged temperatures all presented warming trends: 1.1, 1.3, 0.6, 1.5 and 1.1 \textdegree C/decade at the surface, and 0.7, 1.0, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.6 \textdegree C/decade for the layer average from the surface to 10 km amsl, for spring, summer, autumn, winter, and yearly average, respectively. Most of the water vapor was confined in the lowermost 3 km of the atmosphere with a maximum of 0.35 g kg-1 in December at a 200 m height above surface, and the specific humidity had the similar characteristic of annual cycle and inversion layers as the temperature. At heights below 5 km amsl, increasing trends of specific humidity larger than 0.02 g kg-1/decade occurred during summer months, including the late spring and early autumn, and the annual mean showed an increasing trend of about 0.01\textendash 0.02 g kg-1/decade. Meanwhile, above 5 km amsl, the trends became small and generally less than 0.02 g kg-1/decade in all the months, and beyond 7 km amsl the specific humidity remained almost invariant due to its small moisture content as compared with lower levels. From the surface to 10 km amsl, the specific humidity averaged trends of 0.0062, 0.019, 0.0013, 0.002 and 0.007 g kg-1/decade for spring, summer, autumn, winter and yearly average, respectively.},

The global historical record has been extensively examined, but it is short and plagued with recurring questions about its homogeneity, limiting its effectiveness at assessing how TCs vary with climate. Past warm intervals provide an opportunity to quantify TC behavior in a warmer-than-present world. Here, we use a TC-resolving ({$\sim$}25 km) global atmospheric model to investigate TC activity during the mid-Pliocene warm period (3.264-3.025 Ma) that shares similarities with projections of future climate. Two experiments, one driven by the reconstructed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the other by the SSTs from an ensemble of mid-Pliocene simulations, consistently predict enhanced global-average peak TC intensity during the mid-Pliocene coupled with longer duration, increased power dissipation, and a poleward migration of the location of peak intensity. The simulations are similar to global TC changes observed during recent global warming, as well as those of many future projections, providing a window into the potential TC activity that may be expected in a warmer world. Changes to power dissipation and TC frequency, especially in the Pacific, are sensitive to the different SST patterns, which could affect the viability of the role of TCs as a factor for maintaining a reduced zonal SST gradient during the Pliocene, as recently hypothesized.},

A constant cloud anvil temperature, due to increased anvil altitude, has been argued to lead to a ``zero cloud emission change'' feedback, which can be considered positive relative to the negative feedback associated with cloud anvil warming when cloud altitude is unchanged. Here, partial radiative perturbation (PRP) analysis is used to quantify the radiative feedback caused by clouds that follow the FAT theory (FAT\textendash cloud feedback) and to set this in the context of other feedback components in two atmospheric general circulation models. The FAT\textendash cloud feedback is positive in the PRP framework due to increasing anvil altitude, but because the cloud emission does not change, this positive feedback is cancelled by an equal and opposite component of the temperature feedback due to increasing emission from the cloud. To incorporate this cancellation, the thermal radiative damping with fixed relative humidity and anvil temperature (T-FRAT) decomposition framework is proposed for longwave feedbacks, in which temperature, fixed relative humidity, and FAT\textendash cloud feedbacks are combined. In T-FRAT, the cloud feedback under the FAT constraint is zero, while that under the proportionately higher anvil temperature (PHAT) constraint is negative. The change in the observable cloud radiative effect with FAT\textendash cloud response is also evaluated and shown to be negative due to so-called cloud masking effects. It is shown that ``cloud masking'' is a misleading term in this context, and these effects are interpreted more generally as ``cloud climatology effects.''{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Longwave cloud feedback is systematically positive and nearly the same magnitude across all global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Here it is shown that this robust positive longwave cloud feedback is caused in large part by the tendency for tropical high clouds to rise in such a way as to remain at nearly the same temperature as the climate warms. Furthermore, it is shown that such a cloud response to a warming climate is consistent with well-known physics, specifically the requirement that, in equilibrium, tropospheric heating by convection can only be large in the altitude range where radiative cooling is efficient, following the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis of Hartmann and Larson (2002). Longwave cloud feedback computed assuming that high-cloud temperature follows upper tropospheric convergence-weighted temperature, which we refer to as proportionately higher anvil temperature, gives an excellent prediction of the longwave cloud feedback in the AR4 models. The ensemble-mean feedback of 0.5 W m-2 K-1 is much larger than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed pressure, highlighting the large contribution from rising cloud tops to the robustly positive feedback. An important result of this study is that the convergence profile computed from clear-sky energy and mass balance warms slightly as the climate warms, in proportion to the increase in stability, which results in a longwave cloud feedback that is slightly smaller than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed temperature.},

  abstract = {The quasi-equilibrium assumption proposed by Arakawa and Schubert assumes that convection is controlled by the large-scale forcing in a statistical sense, in such a way that the stabilization of the atmosphere by convection is in quasi-equilibrium with the destabilization by the large-scale forcing. The assumption was developed largely based on observations in the tropical maritime environment and has not been evaluated in midlatitudes. This study examines the quasi-equilibrium assumption in midlatitude continental convection environment using summertime observations from the Southern Great Plains of the United States. Two complementary approaches are taken for this purpose. The first one compares the net time rate of change of convective available potential energy to that due to the large-scale forcing. The second one examines the contributions to the net change of CAPE from the boundary layer air and the free tropospheric air above. Results from both the approaches indicate that the quasi-equilibrium assumption is not well suited for midlatitude continental convection. It is shown that the net change of CAPE is comparable to and largely comes from that due to thermodynamic changes of the boundary layer air, while the contribution from the free troposphere above the boundary layer is negligible. The analysis also shows that the role of convective inhibition to suppress convection is the most pronounced when the large-scale forcing in the free troposphere is weak. On the basis of these and other observations, a modification to the quasi-equilibrium assumption is proposed. It assumes that convective and large-scale processes in the free troposphere above the boundary layer are in balance, so that contribution from the free troposphere to changes in CAPE is negligible. This assumption is then tested using the single column model of the NCAR CCM3 by modifying the closure in the CCM3 convection scheme. Such a modification significantly improves the single column model simulation. The applicability of this new quasi-equilibrium assumption to tropical convection environment is also discussed.},

Results are compared with those in midlatitudes using data from the southern Great Plains in the United States. It is shown that precipitation is highly correlated to the free tropospheric large-scale forcing in both the tropics and midlatitudes. In the tropics, but not in the midlatitudes, precipitation is also highly correlated to the total large-scale forcing that includes surface fluxes. This is because the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes are small over the tropical ocean; thus their contribution to the total large-scale forcing is relatively small compared to the free tropospheric forcing. The opposite is true for midlatitude continental convection. It is also shown that the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium between convection and large-scale forcing recently proposed by the author for midlatitude continental convection is equally accurate for tropical oceanic convection. The quasi-equilibrium proposed by Arakawa and Schubert is less accurate in depicting convective stabilization for data averaged from 3 to 24 hours. On timescales longer than 24 hours the two are comparable. Comparisons are made with other studies that use the Arakawa-Schubert quasi-equilibrium concept, and seemingly contradictory results are reconciled.},

  abstract = {The linearity of global-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) with surface temperature is a basic assumption in climate dynamics. This linearity manifests in global climate models, which robustly produce a global-mean longwave clear-sky (LWCS) feedback of 1.9 W/m2/K, consistent with idealized single-column models (Koll \& Cronin, 2018, https//:doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1809868115). However, there is considerable spatial variability in the LWCS feedback, including negative values over tropical oceans (known as the ``super-greenhouse effect'') which are compensated for by larger values in the subtropics/extratropics. Therefore, it is unclear how the idealized single-column results are relevant for the global-mean LWCS feedback in comprehensive climate models. Here we show with a simple analytical theory and model output that the compensation of this spatial variability to produce a robust global-mean feedback can be explained by two facts: (1) When conditioned upon free-tropospheric column relative humidity (RH), the LWCS feedback is independent of RH, and (2) the global histogram of free-tropospheric column RH is largely invariant under warming.},

A bulk diagnostic approach is constructed, and a set of variables is derived and demonstrated to be useful in understanding the simulated relationship. In particular, a novel bulk quantity, the convective precipitation efficiency or equivalently the convective detrainment efficiency, is proposed as a simple measure of the aggregated properties of parameterized convection important to the GCM simulated clouds. As the convective precipitation efficiency increases in the perturbed-physics experiments, both liquid and ice water path decrease, with low and middle cloud fractions diminishing at a faster rate than high cloud fractions. This asymmetry results in a large sensitivity of top-of-atmosphere net cloud radiative forcing to changes in convective precipitation efficiency in this limited set of models.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}For global warming experiments, intermodel variations in the response of cloud condensate, low cloud fraction, and total cloud radiative forcing are well explained by model variations in response to total precipitation (or detrainment) efficiency. Despite significant variability, all of the perturbed-physics models produce a sizable increase in precipitation efficiency to warming. A substantial fraction of the increase is due to its convective component, which depends on the parameterization of cumulus mixing and convective microphysical processes. The increase in convective precipitation efficiency and associated change in convective cloud height distribution owing to warming explains the increased cloud feedback and climate sensitivity in recently developed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCMs. The results imply that a cumulus scheme using fractional removal of condensate for precipitation and inverse calculation of the entrainment rate tends to produce a lower climate sensitivity than a scheme using threshold removal for precipitation and the entrainment rate formulated inversely dependent on convective depth.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract             The tropical tropospheric temperature is close to but typically cooler than that of the moist adiabat. The negative temperature deviation from the moist adiabat manifests a C-shape profile and is projected to increase and stretch upward under warming in both comprehensive climate models and idealized radiative\textendash convective equilibrium (RCE) simulations. The increased temperature deviation corresponds to a larger convective available potential energy (CAPE) under warming. The extreme convective updraft velocity in RCE increases correspondingly but at a smaller fractional rate than that of CAPE. A conceptual model for the tropical temperature deviation and convective updraft velocities is formulated to understand these features. The model builds on the previous zero-buoyancy model but replaces the bulk zero-buoyancy plume by a spectrum of entraining plumes that have distinct entrainment rates and are positively buoyant until their levels of neutral buoyancy. Besides the negative temperature deviation and its increasing magnitude with warming, this allows the spectral plume model to further predict the C-shape profile as well as its upward stretch with warming. By representing extreme convective updrafts as weakly entraining plumes, the model is able to reproduce the smaller fractional increase in convective velocities with warming as compared to that of CAPE. The smaller fractional increase is mainly caused by the upward stretch in the temperature deviation profile with warming, which reduces the ratio between the integrated plume buoyancy and CAPE. The model thus provides a useful tool for understanding the tropical temperature profile and convective updraft velocities.},
