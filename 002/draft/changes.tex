\section{Introduction}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Earth's modern climate is maintained by three types of energy transfer: advection, radiation, and surface turbulent fluxes \citep[e.g., see Ch.~6.2 in][]{hartmann2016}. These energy transfer types can be most easily defined using the vertically-integrated, zonal-mean, annual-mean moist static energy (MSE) budget:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:mse-ann}
    {\underbrace{ \langle\partial_y \overline{[vm]}\rangle}_{\text{advection}}} = {\underbrace{\vphantom{\partial_y \langle [vm]\rangle} \overline{[R_{a}]}}_\text{radiation}} + {\underbrace{\vphantom{\partial_y \langle [vm]\rangle} \mathrm{\overline{[LH]}+\overline{[SH]}}}_\text{surface turbulence}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $m=c_p T + gz + Lq$ is MSE, $\overline{(\cdot)}$ is the annual mean, $[\cdot]$ is the zonal mean, and $\langle \cdot \rangle$ is the mass-weighted vertical integral \citep{neelin1987}. Advection corresponds to the meridional divergence ($\partial_y(\cdot)\equiv \frac{1}{r\cos{\phi}}\partial_\phi\left((\cdot)\cos{\phi}\right)$ is the meridional divergence in spherical coordinates, where $\phi$ is latitude and $r$ is the radius of Earth) of MSE flux ($vm$ where $v$ is meridional velocity) and represents the energy transported by the atmospheric circulation, such as the Hadley cell and storm tracks. Radiation ($R_a$) corresponds to atmospheric radiative cooling, which is \replaced{the difference of the top of atmosphere and surface radiative fluxes}{equivalent to the sum of radiative fluxes through the top of the atmosphere and surface}. Finally, surface turbulent fluxes correspond to surface latent ($\mathrm{LH}$) and sensible ($\mathrm{SH}$) heat flux.

In the annual mean, the dominant types of energy transfer depend on latitude \citep[e.g., see Fig.~6.1 in][]{hartmann2016}. In the low latitudes, atmospheric radiative cooling is primarily balanced by surface turbulent fluxes \citep{riehl1958}, which destabilize the column to convection by supplying moist, warm air to the boundary layer. The dominant balance between radiative cooling and surface turbulent fluxes is consistent with Radiative Convective Equilibrium \citep[RCE,][]{wing2018}. In the high latitudes, atmospheric radiative cooling is primarily balanced by advection from lower latitudes \citep{nakamura1988} consistent with Radiative Advective Equilibrium \citep[RAE,][]{cronin2016}. Finally in the midlatitudes, all three types of energy transfer are important; thus, we introduce the term Radiative Convective Advective Equilibrium (RCAE). In this way, three energy balance regimes qualitatively characterize the low, mid, and high latitude regions of Earth's modern climate.

\replaced{A}{The a}nnual mean lapse rate \replaced{regimes}{structure} also\added{ qualitatively} characterize\deleted{s}\added{ the} low, mid, and high latitude regions of Earth's modern climate. \replaced{The low latitudes exhibit a moist adiabatic lapse rate regime}{The lapse rate in low latitudes is close to moist adiabatic} \citep{stone1979,betts1982,xu1989,williams1993}\replaced{. T}{, t}he high latitudes \replaced{exhibit a surface inversion lapse rate regime}{typically feature a surface inversion} \citep[e.g., see Fig.~1.3 in][]{hartmann2016}\added{. Finally},\deleted{ and} the midlatitudes \added{are a mixed regime, which }\replaced{is}{are typically} more stable than a moist adiabat \citep{stone1979,korty2007} \replaced{with no}{and do not exhibit} surface inversion\deleted{s}.

The lapse rate \replaced{regime}{structure} varies through the seasonal cycle in the Northern Hemisphere. For example, \replaced{the midlatitudes exhibit a moist adiabatic regime in summer and a mixed regime in winter}{the lapse rate in the midlatitudes is within 20\% of a moist adiabat in July, whereas the deviation increases up to 50\% in January} \citep{stone1979}. \replaced{T}{In t}he Northern Hemisphere high latitudes\replaced{ exhibit a mixed regime in summer and a surface inversion regime in winter}{, the inversion frequency and strength decrease in summertime} \citep{bradley1992, tjernstrom2009, devasthale2010, zhang2011, cronin2016}\deleted{ and may vanish altogether Stone and Carlson (1979)}.

While energy balance and lapse rate regimes\added{ qualitatively} characterize\added{ the} low, mid, and high latitude\added{s} \deleted{regions }of Earth's modern climate, few studies to date have quantified \deleted{1) }the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of observed energy balance regimes and \replaced{their link to lapse rate regimes}{2) the link between energy balance and lapse rate regimes} in reanalyses and \added{general circulation models (}GCMs\added{)}.

Quantifying the latitudinal\added{ and seasonal} dependence of observed energy balance regimes would allow us to assess where\added{ and when} idealized models that assume RCE or RAE hold.\added{ This would be useful for several reasons.}\deleted{ This is particularly important for RCE, which has become a standard idealized configuration for tropical theories (e.g., Emanuel and Bister 1996; Nilsson and Emanuel 1999; Romps 2014; Singh and O'Gorman 2015) and simulations (Wing et al. 2018, and the references therein).}\added{ First, the results of many studies investigating the tropical climate (precipitation, cloud, and circulation) and its response to warming use models that assume RCE} \citep[e.g.,][]{romps2011,popke2013,pendergrass2016,merlis2019}\added{. Quantifying the latitudinal and seasonal dependence of RCE in the modern climate can guide where and when these insights are applicable.} \cite{jakob2019} \added{took a first step in this direction by quantifying the spatial and temporal scales that satisfy RCE in the tropics. However, they did not examine the possible occurrence of RCE outside of the tropics or energy balance regimes more generally (RAE and RCAE).} 

\added{Second, knowledge of energy balance regimes for the modern climate could provide a useful guide for interpreting the vertical structure of the warming response latitudinally and seasonally. For regions that are in RCE in the modern climate and remain in RCE in the future, the expectation is that warming maximizes aloft}\deleted{Quantifying the link between energy balance and lapse rate regimes would also allow us to better understand the regional response to CO$_2$ forcing. For example, regions of RCE that exhibit a moist adiabatic lapse rate will have amplified warming aloft in response to increased CO$_2$} \citep{held1993, romps2011}. \replaced{For regions that are in RAE in the modern climate and remain in RAE in the future, the expectation is that warming maximizes at the surface}{In contrast, regions of RAE that exhibit a surface inversion will have amplified warming at the surface in response to increased CO$_2$} \citep[assuming that the radiative forcing dominates over changes in surface or advective heat flux, ][]{held1993, cronin2016}.\added{ However, it is an open question whether energy balance regimes in the modern climate provide a useful guide to the vertical structure of the warming response latitudinally and seasonally.}

\deleted{Recent work by Jakob et al. (2019) quantified regions of RCE using the dry static energy (DSE) budget and a dimensional threshold (sum of radiative cooling, latent heating associated with precipitation, and surface sensible heating $< \pm 50$~W~m$^{-2}$). They find that RCE is approximately satisfied over large spatial ($>5000$ km) and temporal ($>$ daily) scales in the tropics. However, the latitudinal distribution of RCE outside the tropics and the distribution of RAE and RCAE have not been investigated.}

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Defining energy balance regimes using the nondimensionalized MSE budget} \label{subsec:mse}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    In order to define energy balance regimes seasonally, we begin with the vertically-integrated, zonal-mean MSE equation:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:mse}
        \left\langle\left[\partial_t m\right]\right\rangle + \langle\partial_y [vm]\rangle = [R_{a}] + \mathrm{[LH]+[SH]} \, ,
    \end{equation}
    where $\langle[\partial_t m]\rangle$ represents atmospheric MSE storage. In order to nondimensionalize equation~(\ref{eq:mse}), we divide by radiative cooling $R_a$, which is sign definite \replaced{for the modern climate}{in the zonal mean}:
    \begin{equation}
        {\underbrace{\frac{\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm)}{R_{a}}}_{R_1}} = 1 + {\underbrace{\frac{\mathrm{LH+SH}}{R_{a}}}_{R_2}} \, ,
    \end{equation}
    where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are nondimensional numbers and the $[\cdot]$ and $\langle\cdot\rangle$ have been dropped for brevity. 

    In the strictest sense, RCE is a steady-state equilibrium where radiation balances surface turbulent fluxes (\(R_{1}=0\)). As this is exactly satisfied only in the global mean, we define RCE as \(R_{1}\le \varepsilon\), where $\varepsilon$ is a small number. This definition includes regions of vertically-integrated MSE flux divergence and weak convergence because temperature profiles in regions of divergence are set by convective adjustment \citep{warren2020}.

    RAE as defined in \cite{cronin2016} requires surface turbulent fluxes to be negligibly small (\(R_{2}=0\) or equivalently \(R_{1}=1\)). Although exact RAE further requires atmospheric storage to be small ($\partial_t m=0$), the framework developed by \cite{cronin2016} could readily be generalized to account for the time tendency term, which would add to the advective tendency. To be consistent with the definition of RCE, we define RAE as regions where surface turbulent fluxes are small or directed from the atmosphere to the surface (\(R_{2} \ge -\varepsilon \) or equivalently \(R_{1} \ge 1-\varepsilon\)).

    In order to choose the value for $\varepsilon$, we examine the \deleted{zonal mean, annual mean }deviation of the\added{ zonal-mean, annual-mean} lapse rate from the moist adiabatic lapse rate binned by the value of $R_1$ using reanalysis data (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-binned-r1}). The lapse rate deviation is plotted in sigma coordinates to ensure that surface inversions are properly represented (see Appendix~A for more details). The tropospheric lapse rate deviation is nearly a monotonic function of $R_1$ (especially above $\sigma=0.7$ and below $\sigma=0.9$), demonstrating the quantitative link between energy balance and lapse rate regimes. \replaced{The}{A} surface inversion\added{ lapse rate regime} occurs for $R_1 \ge 0.9$ and thus we define the RAE regime as $R_1\ge1-\epsilon=0.9$ (thick blue line, Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-binned-r1}). Consistently, we define the RCE regime as $R_1\le\varepsilon=0.1$. Where $R_1\le 0.1$, the free tropospheric lapse rate (vertically averaged from $\sigma=0.7$ to 0.3)\added{ is in the moist adiabatic lapse rate regime (i.e., it} deviates from the moist adiabatic lapse rate by less than 13\%\replaced{, }{ (}thick \replaced{orange}{green} line\replaced{ in}{,} Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-binned-r1}). Finally,\added{ we define the} RCAE\replaced{ regime as where}{ is defined for the intermediate values of} $0.1<R_1<0.9$\added{, where it corresponds to the mixed lapse rate regime (i.e., $>13$\% more stable than a moist adiabatic lapse rate but does not exhibit a surface inversion)}.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Reanalysis data}\label{subsec:reanalysis}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    We consider three reanalysis datasets from 1980 through 2005: ERA5 \citep{hersbach2020}, MERRA2 \citep{gelaro2017}, and JRA55 \citep{kobayashi2015}. We focus on the energy balance and lapse rate regimes for the multi-reanalysis mean and show the spread as the range across the three reanalyses. Atmospheric storage ($\partial_t m$) is computed by taking the finite difference of MSE using monthly temperature, specific humidity, and geopotential data, following \cite{donohoe2013}. Additionally, we use the monthly radiative ($R_a$) and surface turbulent ($\mathrm{LH}$ and $\mathrm{SH}$) fluxes and infer the advective flux ($\partial_y (vm)$) as the residual. We choose to infer advection as the residual because the mass-correction technique for directly computing the MSE flux divergence in reanalysis data is known to produce unphysical results in the high latitudes \citep{porter2010}. 

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{CMIP5 simulations}\label{subsec:cmip}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    We consider \replaced{the r1i1p1 historical simulation averaged over 1980 through 2005 and the r1i1p1 RCP8.5 simulation averaged over 2070 through 2099 for 36 CMIP5 models}{the r1i1p1 historical runs of 41 CMIP5 models from 1980--2005} \citep[Table~B1,][]{taylor2012}. We show the energy balance and lapse rate regimes for the multimodel mean and show the spread as the interquartile range across the models. Consistent with the reanalysis products, we compute $R_1$ using monthly $\partial_t m$, $R_a$, $\mathrm{LH}$, and $\mathrm{SH}$, and infer $\partial_y (vm) $ as the residual.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Idealized climate models}\label{subsec:models}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    We use two idealized climate models to understand the seasonal changes in energy balance regimes. At intermediate complexity, we examine seasonal changes in the ECHAM6 slab ocean aquaplanet model \citep{stevens2013}, hereafter referred to as AQUA. AQUA simulations are configured with a seasonal cycle, no ocean heat transport, modern greenhouse gas concentrations, and with or without thermodynamic sea ice following \cite{shaw2020}.\added{ Details of the thermodynamic sea ice model in ECHAM6 are provided in \cite{giorgetta2013}.} 
    
    In order to explore the seasonal variation in energy balance regimes, we vary the mixed layer depth in AQUA from 3 to 50 m\added{ without sea ice and 25 to 50 m with ice} following previous work \citep{donohoe2014, barpanda2020, shaw2020}.\added{ \cite{shaw2020} showed that AQUA enters a Snowball Earth regime for mixed layer depths below 20 m; hence, 25 m is the minimum mixed layer depth for AQUA with ice considered here.} A monthly climatology is obtained by averaging the last 20 years of the 40 year simulation except for the 3 m configuration, where the last 5 years of a 15 year simulation are averaged due to the faster equilibration. Consistent with the reanalysis products and the CMIP5 simulations, we compute $R_1$ using the monthly $\partial_t m$, $R_a$, $\mathrm{LH}$, and $\mathrm{SH}$, and infer $\partial_y (vm) $ as the residual.

    At the simple end, we use the EBM of \cite{rose2017}. The EBM is an equation for the zonal-mean surface temperature:
    \begin{equation}
      \rho c_w d \; \partial_t T_s = aQ - (A+BT_s)  + \frac{D}{\cos\phi}\partial_\phi\left( \partial_\phi T_s \; \cos\phi \right)\, ,
    \end{equation}
    where $\rho$ is the density of water, $c_w$ is the specific heat capacity of liquid water, $d$ is the mixed layer depth, $T_s$ is the zonal-mean surface temperature, $a$ is the co-albedo, $Q$ is insolation, $A+BT_s$ is outgoing longwave radiation where $A$ and $B$ are constant coefficients, $\phi$ is latitude, and $D$ is the diffusivity, which is assumed to be a constant. We set $A=-410$~W~m$^{-2}$, $B=2.33$~W~m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, $D=0.90$~W~m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and $a=0.72$, which are obtained from best fits to AQUA configured with a 25 m mixed layer depth and without sea ice. Best fits of $A$ and $B$ are obtained by taking the least squares linear regression of the zonal-mean $\mathrm{OLR}$ and $T_s$. The best fit of $D$ is obtained similarly by taking the least squares linear regression of $\partial_y (vm)$ and $\frac{1}{\cos\phi}\partial_\phi \left(\partial_\phi T_s \; \cos\phi \right)$ for latitudes poleward of $25^\circ$. Lastly, $a$ is computed as the globally-averaged diagnosed planetary co-albedo.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Energy balance regimes in reanalysis data} \label{sec:diagnostics}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Annual-mean energy balance regimes}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    In the annual mean, the RCE regime, defined by $R_1 \le 0.1$, extends from the deep tropics to $\approx 40^\circ$ (black line overlapping orange region in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ann}a).\added{ The moist adiabatic lapse rate regime occurs in the same region. In particular,} \replaced{t}{T}he free tropospheric lapse rate, defined as the vertically-averaged lapse rate from $\sigma=0.7$ to 0.3, closely follows $R_1$ (compare orange and black lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ann}a) and deviates $-3$\% to $+13$\% from a moist adiabat where $R_1 \le 0.1$.

    The RAE regime, defined by $R_1 \ge 0.9$, occurs poleward of $\approx 80^\circ$N and $\approx 70^\circ$S in the annual mean (black line overlapping blue region in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ann}b). The reanalysis spread in the high latitudes is large in both hemispheres due to high uncertainty in the estimation of surface turbulent fluxes \citep{tastula2013,graham2019}. The largest values of $R_1$ are found over Antarctica whereas $R_1$ is close to the RCAE threshold in the Arctic.\deleted{ Consistently,}\added{ The RAE regime coincides with \replaced{a}{that of the} surface inversion lapse rate regime. Specifically,} the region where $R_1\ge 0.9$ exhibits $>100\%$ deviation from a moist adiabat indicating a surface inversion (blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ann}b).

    Lastly, the RCAE regime, defined by $0.1 < R_1 < 0.9$, occurs between $40$ to $80^\circ$N and $40$ to $70^\circ$S in the annual mean (black line overlapping the white region in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ann}a).\added{ The RCAE regime coincides with the mixed lapse rate regime, where the lapse rate is more stable than a moist adiabat and does not exhibit a surface inversion. Specifically,} \replaced{t}{T}he free tropospheric lapse rate in the region where $0.1 < R_1 < 0.9$ deviates $+13$\% to $+35$\% from a moist adiabat.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Seasonality of energy balance regimes} \label{subsec:seasonality}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    The seasonality of $R_1$ is weak in the Southern Hemisphere, such that the latitudinal extent of RCE (equatorward of $40^\circ$S), RAE (poleward of $70^\circ$S), and RCAE regimes (between $40$ to $70^\circ$S) is largely the same throughout the year (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}a). Consistently, \replaced{the midlatitudes exhibit a mixed lapse rate regime (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}b) and the high latitudes exhibit a surface inversion yearround (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}c)}{both the seasonality of free tropospheric lapse rate deviation (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}b) and the boundary layer lapse rate deviation in the high latitudes (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}c) exhibit weak seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere}.

    In the Northern Hemisphere, the RCE regime occurs yearround equatorward of $40^\circ$N and expands poleward to $70^\circ$N during June (region equatorward of the thick orange contour in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}a). The seasonality of the \replaced{moist adiabatic lapse rate regime}{free tropospheric lapse rate deviation from a moist adiabat} similiarly expands poleward during summertime (e.g., see the 15\% deviation contour in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}b). However, there is a phase shift between the seasonality of energy balance and lapse rate regimes\added{ in the midlatitudes}. \replaced{T}{In particular, t}he Northern midlatitudes are in \replaced{the}{an} RCE regime from April to July\replaced{ but in the moist adiabatic}{, while the} lapse rate \replaced{regime}{is within $13$\% of a moist adiabat} from June to September (compare solid black and orange lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}a). This lag is associated with the seasonality of atmospheric storage. When atmospheric storage is excluded from $R_1$, there is closer agreement in the phase of the energy balance and lapse rate seasonality (compare dashed black and orange lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}a).

    The Northern Hemisphere RAE regime occurs poleward of $80^\circ$N with the exception of May and June (region poleward of the thick blue contour in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}a). Consistently, the \replaced{mixed lapse rate regime occurs}{boundary layer stability decreases} during May and June (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}c), but \deleted{relatively low static stability }persists through September despite \replaced{being in a state of RAE}{high values of $R_1$} (compare solid black and blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}b). The atmospheric storage term again plays an important role in the seasonal atmospheric MSE budget (compare solid and dashed black lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}b). However, unlike in the midlatitudes, the discrepancy in the timing of the energy balance and lapse rate regimes in the high latitudes cannot be directly related to the seasonality of atmospheric storage (compare dashed black and blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}b).

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \subsection{Decomposition of seasonal energy balance regime transitions}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    In order to diagnose the physical mechanism responsible for the seasonal\added{ energy balance} regime transitions in the Northern Hemisphere, we decompose the seasonality of $R_1$ as follows:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:r1-dev}
      \Delta R_1 = \overline{R_1}\left( \frac{\Delta(\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm))}{\overline{\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm)}}  - \frac{\Delta R_a }{\overline{R_a}}\right) + \mathrm{Residual} \, ,

    where $\Delta(\cdot)$ is the deviation from the annual mean and $\overline{(\cdot)}$ is the annual mean. The dynamic component \replaced{[}{(}first term on the right hand side of equation~\added{(}\ref{eq:r1-dev}\added{)}\replaced{]}{)} quantifies the importance of advection plus atmospheric storage, and the radiative component \replaced{[}{(}second term on the right hand side of equation~\added{(}\ref{eq:r1-dev}\added{)}\replaced{]}{)} quantifies the importance of radiative cooling. Lastly, the residual quantifies the importance of nonlinear interactions.

    The RCAE to RCE regime transition in the Northern midlatitudes (where the solid black line intersects the orange region in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a) closely follows the dynamic component (compare black and red lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a) whereas the other terms are small (gray and dash-dot line in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a). The RCE regime corresponds to the time when advection plus atmospheric storage are small (sum of black and red lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}b). In the Southern Hemisphere, the dynamic and radiative components are of similar magnitude and partially compensate, leading to relatively small seasonality in $R_1$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}c). The radiative components are similar between the two hemispheres (compare gray lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a and \ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}c). Thus, there is no midlatitude regime transition to RCE in the Southern Hemisphere because the dynamic component is small, which is consistent with the small seasonality of advection plus storage (black and red lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}d).

    \replaced{The RAE to RCAE regime transition in the Northern high latitudes is the outcome of opposing dynamic and radiative components}{The RAE to RCAE regime transition in the Northern high latitudes is a small residual of the dynamic and radiative components} (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}a).\added{ Since $\overline{R_1}=\overline{\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm)}/\overline{R_a}\approx 1$ in the Northern high latitudes (see black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ann}), equation~(\ref{eq:r1-dev}) simplifies to:}
    \begin{align}

    While the results above focused on the reanalysis mean, similar seasonality is \deleted{also }found in the CMIP5 historical simulations (Fig.~B1--B6). In particular, CMIP5 models capture the regime transition in the Northern midlatitudes and its connection to the large seasonality of advection plus storage (Fig.~B5). CMIP5 models also capture the regime transition in the Northern high latitudes and its connection to a summertime increase in latent heat flux (Fig.~B6). Some small differences between the reanalysis and CMIP5 mean are discussed in Appendix~B.

\section{Testing hypotheses to explain seasonal\added{ energy balance} regime transitions\deleted{ using idealized climate models}} \label{sec:hypo}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsection{Midlatitude regime transition} \label{subsec:mld}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  Previous studies have found that surface heat capacity controls the seasonality of various climate phenomena, such as surface temperature \citep{donohoe2014}, Intertropical Convergence Zone \citep{bordoni2008}, and storm track intensity and position \citep{barpanda2020}, due to its effect on the seasonality of surface energy fluxes. Thus, we hypothesize that surface heat capacity controls the existence of midlatitude energy \replaced{balance}{transfer} regime transitions. In order to connect the seasonality of $R_1$ to surface heat capacity, we begin by rewriting the atmospheric MSE budget in terms of\deleted{ fluxes at the} top of the atmosphere ($F_\mathrm{TOA}$) and\deleted{ the} surface ($F_\mathrm{SFC}$)\added{ fluxes} following \cite{barpanda2020}:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:mse-toasfc}
    \Delta\left(\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm) \right) = \Delta F_{\mathrm{TOA}} - \Delta F_{\mathrm{SFC}} \, .
  \end{equation}
  We can write the seasonality of surface fluxes using the surface energy budget of a mixed layer ocean:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:sfc-budget}
    \Delta F_{\mathrm{SFC}} = \rho c_{w} d \Delta\left(\partial_t T_{s}\right) + \Delta ( \partial_y F_{O}) \approx \rho c_{w} d \Delta\left(\partial_t T_{s}\right) \, ,
  \end{equation}
  where $\rho$ is the density of water, $c_w$ is the specific heat capacity of liquid water, $d$ is the mixed layer depth, and $\Delta(\partial_y F_O)$ is the seasonality of meridional ocean heat flux divergence, which we neglect because it is small \citep{roberts2017}. Finally, we divide by $\overline{R_a}$\replaced{ and combine equations~(\ref{eq:r1-dev}), (\ref{eq:mse-toasfc}), and (\ref{eq:sfc-budget}) to obtain}{, which yields} an equation for the seasonality of $R_1$:
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:mse-toasfc-approx}
    \Delta R_1 \approx \frac{\Delta\left(\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm) \right)}{\overline{R_a}} = \frac{1}{\overline{R_a}} \left(\Delta F_{\mathrm{TOA}} - \rho c_{w} d \Delta\left(\partial_t T_{s}\right)\right) \, , 
  \end{equation}
  where \deleted{we assumed that }the radiative component is assumed to be negligible\added{, consistent with the Northern midlatitudes where the regime transition occurs} (\replaced{see}{c.f.} Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a). In order to close equation~(\ref{eq:mse-toasfc-approx}), which depends on the unknown surface temperature tendency, we make use of the EBM (see Section~\ref{sec:methods}\ref{subsec:models} and Appendix~C for more details). \replaced{Using}{Following} the\added{ analytic} EBM, \deleted{we can write }equation~(\ref{eq:mse-toasfc-approx}) \replaced{becomes}{as}
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear4}
    \Delta R_{1} = \frac{Q^{*}}{\overline{R_{a}}}\frac{2D}{(B+2D)^{2}+(\rho c_w d \omega)^{2}}\left[(B+2D)\cos(\omega t)+\rho c_w d \omega \sin(\omega t)\right] \, ,
  \end{equation}
  where $Q^*$ is the seasonal amplitude of insolation and $\omega=2\pi$ yr$^{-1}$. \replaced{Thus, the EBM predicts that the seasonality of $R_1$ is large for shallow mixed layer depths and small for deep mixed layer depths (black line, Fig.~\ref{fig:amp-r1-echam}a)}{According to equation~(\ref{eq:r1-linear4}), the amplitude of $\Delta R_1$ decreases as the mixed layer depth $d$ increases if all else is equal}. 

  The dependence of\added{ the amplitude of} $\Delta R_1$ on mixed layer depth in AQUA is qualitatively consistent with the EBM prediction (compare stars to solid black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:amp-r1-echam}a). \deleted{While $\Delta R_1$ is less sensitive to the mixed layer depth in the EBM than in AQUA at very small mixed layer depths, it captures the seasonal amplitude of surface temperature (Fig.~\ref{fig:amp-r1-echam}b). }\added{Both AQUA and EBM agree that t}\deleted{T}he midlatitude regime transition from RCAE to RCE\added{ only occurs for shallow mixed layer depths. The regime transition occurs} in the EBM\deleted{ occurs} for $d \le 16$~m and in AQUA\deleted{ occurs} for $d \le 20$~m (intersection of the line and stars with the orange region in Fig.~\ref{fig:amp-r1-echam}a).\added{ This is consistent with the observed hemispheric asymmetry in the midlatitude regime transition. The regime transition is absent in the ocean-dominated (deep mixed layer) Southern midlatitudes (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}c) whereas the regime transition occurs in the Northern midlatitudes (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a), where the land fraction is higher (shallower mixed layer depth).}

  \added{The phase of $R_1$ is also a function of the mixed layer depth in AQUA (Fig.~\ref{fig:amp-r1-echam}b). The seasonal minimum of $R_1$ occurs as early as June in AQUA with a 3~m mixed layer depth and as late as September with a 50~m mixed layer depth. While AQUA with a 3~m mixed layer depth captures the phase of $R_1$ in the Northern midlatitudes in reanalysis data, it overpredicts the amplitude by a factor of three (compare cyan line in Fig.~\ref{fig:amp-r1-echam}b with black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a). This suggests that the seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere may be the result of zonal variations in surface heat capacity (land vs ocean).}

  When AQUA is configured with a mixed layer depth of 15~m, the amplitude of the \(R_{1}\) seasonality closely resembles the Northern midlatitudes (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}a and Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}a). However, the regime transition in AQUA with a 15~m mixed layer depth lags that in reanalysis data\added{ as discussed above}.\deleted{ This phase lag can be partly rectified by choosing a smaller (3~m) mixed layer depth, but this comes at the expense of amplifying the seasonality by a factor of three (not shown).} The regime transition in AQUA is associated with a large seasonality of advection plus atmospheric storage\added{,} consistent with the Northern midlatitudes in reanalysis data (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}b to \ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}b). 
  
  \replaced{W}{Consistent with the EBM prediction, w}hen AQUA is configured\added{ with} a 40~m mixed layer depth, \(\Delta R_{1}\) closely resembles the Southern midlatitudes; namely, there is no regime transition (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}c and Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}c). The persistence of the RCAE regime throughout the seasonal cycle in the 40~m aquaplanet simulation can be attributed to the weak seasonality of advection plus atmospheric storage, consistent with the results for the Southern midlatitudes in reanalysis data (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}d and \ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-mid}d).

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \subsection{High latitude regime transition} \label{subsec:ice}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \deleted{The existence of a high latitude regime transition in the Northern Hemisphere is associated with a large summertime latent heat flux and a small annual-mean $R_1$ compared to the Southern Hemisphere (compare blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}b,d and horizontal black lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}a,c). }The polar regions on Earth are fundamentally different in that the Northern Hemisphere has a polar ocean whereas the Southern Hemisphere has a polar continent. Given these differences, we quantify the importance of the following mechanisms \replaced{for the energy balance regime seasonality in the high latitudes}{on the high latitude energy balance seasonality}: 1) sea ice in the Arctic and 2) topography in the Antarctic.
  
  \replaced{Sea ice in the Arctic affects the surface heat capacity, surface albedo, and surface turbulent fluxes}{In the Arctic, surface latent heat flux is strongly affected by the presence of sea ice, which increases the albedo and modulates heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere} \citep{andreas1979, maykut1982}. We therefore expect sea ice to play a key role in the seasonality of energy balance regimes in the Northern high latitudes. We test the importance of sea ice using mechanism\replaced{-}{ }denial experiments where AQUA is configured with and without thermodynamic sea ice\added{ for various mixed layer depths} (Section~\ref{sec:methods}\ref{subsec:models}).

  \added{Without sea ice, AQUA has a fixed surface albedo of the ocean (0.07) and in the annual mean, the high latitudes are in the RCAE and mixed lapse rate regime for all mixed layer depths (Table~\ref{tab:aqua-r1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}a,b). Thus, the low surface heat capacity effect of sea ice alone cannot account for the occurence of annual-mean RAE in the Northern high latitudes.}
  
  \added{With sea ice, the annual-mean high latitudes in AQUA are in the RAE and surface inversion lapse rate regime for 25 through 40~m mixed layer depths (Table~\ref{tab:aqua-r1} and Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c,d). For deeper mixed layer depths, the high latitudes are in RCAE. Thus, sea ice is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for obtaining annual-mean RAE in the Northern high latitudes.}
  
  \added{Without sea ice, the high latitudes in AQUA do not exhibit a seasonal regime transition from RCAE to RAE across most mixed layer depths (10 to 50~m, see Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}a). The exception is the shallowest mixed layer depth (5~m), which exhibits a transition to RAE from March to May (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}a). However, the timing of the regime transition is not consistent with reanalysis data (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}a).}
  
  \added{With sea ice, the high latitudes in AQUA exhibit a seasonal regime transition from RCAE to RAE across all mixed layer depths (25 to 50~m, Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c,d). For shallower mixed layer depths (25 to 40~m), the RAE and surface inversion regime occur from September to April (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c,d). For deeper mixed layer depths (45 and 50~m), the RAE regime only occurs from December to April (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c,d). The timing of energy balance and lapse rate regime transitions coincides in AQUA with ice (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c and \ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}d). In contrast, the timing of the energy balance and lapse rate regimes exhibit a discrepancy in the reanalysis data (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}b). The summertime energy balance regime transition in the reanalysis data is better represented by AQUA with shallower mixed layer depths (compare solid black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}b and 25 to 40~m lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c). On the other hand, the extended lapse rate regime transition in the reanalysis data is better represented by AQUA with deeper mixed layer depths (compare blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-ga-temporal}b to 45 and 50~m lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}d).}

  \added{The different timing of the seasonal RCAE to RAE regime transition in the high latitudes in AQUA with sea ice coincides with different sea ice fraction and depth during fall (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}). For shallower mixed layer depths (25 to 40~m), the high latitudes are in RAE in fall, which is associated with full coverage (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}b) of thick sea ice (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}c) and a high surface albedo (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}c). For deeper mixed layer depths (45 and 50~m), the high latitudes are in RCAE in the fall, which is associated with partial coverage (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}b) of thin sea ice (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}c) and lower albedo (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}a). These results suggest that sea ice impacts the timing of high latitude regime transitions through the combined effect of surface albedo and effective surface heat capacity, which themselves depend on the mixed layer depth in AQUA.}
  
  % \added{The timing of the high latitude regime transition in AQUA with sea ice corresponds to differences in the seasonality of surface albedo, sea ice fraction, and sea ice depth (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}). The short regime transition for shallower mixed layer depths (25 to 40~m) coincides with a consistent summertime decrease in surface albedo (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}a). An exception is the 25~m AQUA, where the surface albedo is seasonally invariant. This suggests that a seasonally varying effective surface heat capacity may be important, because significant $R_1$ seasonality occurs even when a constant high albedo is imposed.}
  
  % \added{The extended regime transition for deeper mixed layer depths (45 and 50~m) coincides with a larger seasonal decrease in sea ice fraction and surface albedo that extends into autumn (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-ice-props}). As sea ice thickness and surface albedo follow a similar seasonal cycle, both the effective surface heat capacity and surface albedo effects of sea ice are plausible mechanisms for the extension of the RCAE energy balance regime into autumn.}

  In the Antarctic, the annual-mean value of $R_1$ is larger than\added{ in} the Arctic and there is no regime transition from RAE to RCAE. In the presence of Antarctic topography, the atmosphere is optically thinner, so that we expect atmospheric radiative cooling to be weaker\added{ \citep{jeevanjee2018}}, and thus \replaced{$R_1=(\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm))/R_a$}{$R_1=\frac{\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm)}{R_a}$} to be larger. We therefore investigate the impact of Antarctic topography on the seasonality of energy balance regimes using mechanism\replaced{-}{ }denial experiments. In particular, we use the CESM simulations configured with and without\deleted{ (flattened)} Antarctic topography by \cite{hahn2020}.

  The control CESM simulation with Antarctic topography captures the seasonality of $R_1$ in the reanalyses and CMIP5 historical runs. In particular, the Northern high latitudes undergo a RAE to RCAE regime transition in June (solid line intersects the white region in Fig.~\ref{fig:hahn-aa}a) while the Southern high latitudes remain in RAE yearround (dashed line remains in the blue region in Fig.~\ref{fig:hahn-aa}a). Without Antarctic topography, $\overline{R_1}$ decreases from 1.30 to 1.12 in the Southern high latitudes (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:hahn-aa}a to \ref{fig:hahn-aa}b). However, because topography does not significantly affect summertime $R_1$, the Southern high latitudes without Antarctic topography continue to remain in RAE yearround (dashed line remains in the blue region in Fig.~\ref{fig:hahn-aa}b).\deleted{ In both configurations of CESM, Antarctic latent heat flux remains small (below 5~W~m$^{-2}$, compare dashed and solid lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:hahn-aa}c,d).} Thus, while Antarctic topography partially explains the large hemispheric asymmetry in annual-mean $R_1$, it does not \replaced{explain the lack}{significantly affect the seasonality} of\added{ an} energy balance regime\deleted{s}\added{ transition} \replaced{in Antarctica}{in the Antarctic}.
  
  \added{The hemispheric asymmetry in energy balance regimes also cannot be solely explained by the near-constant high surface albedo in Antarctica, since an energy balance regime transition occurs in the presence of a seasonally invariant high surface albedo in AQUA (see 25 m simulation in Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae-mld}c). Thus, multiple mechanisms may need to be considered together to understand the seasonality of energy balance regimes in Antarctica.}

\section{\added{Connecting energy balance regimes in the modern climate to the vertical structure of the warming response}} \label{sec:vtemp}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\added{Here we quantify whether energy balance regimes in the modern climate provide a useful guide to the vertical, latitudinal, and seasonal structure of the warming response. For regions of RCE in the modern climate that stay in RCE in the future, the expectation is that warming maximizes aloft \citep{held1993, romps2011}. On the other hand, for regions of RAE in the modern climate that stay in RAE in the future, the expectation is that warming maximizes at the surface, assuming that the change in advective heat flux is negligible \citep{held1993, payne2015}.}

\added{In the annual mean, the CMIP5 multimodel mean latitudinal structure of energy balance regimes remains unchanged by the end of the century with the exception of a small region between $75^\circ$--$80^\circ$N (compare solid and dashed lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-r1-ann-rcp}a). Consistently, regions of RCE in the modern climate exhibit amplified warming aloft (red lines, $R_1\le 0.1$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-r1-ann-rcp}b) and regions of RAE in the modern climate exhibit amplified warming at the surface (blue lines, $R_1\ge 0.9$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-r1-ann-rcp}b). Thus, energy balance regimes defined using $R_1$ in the modern climate can be used to interpret the vertical structure of the annual-mean warming response.} 

\added{The seasonality of energy balance regimes in the tropics and Southern high latitudes is largely unchanged in response to warming (compare dashed and solid thick contours in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-dtemp}). Consistently, the tropics, which are a region of RCE in the modern climate and stay in RCE in the future, exhibit amplified warming aloft throughout the seasonal cycle (red-filled contours in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-dtemp}). Furthermore, the Southern high latitudes, which are a region of RAE in the modern climate and stay in RAE in the future, exhibit amplified surface warming throughout the seasonal cycle (blue-filled contours in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-dtemp}). Thus, energy balance regimes in the modern climate can also be used to interpret the vertical structure of the warming response seasonally in the tropics and Southern high latitudes.}

\added{In the Northern Hemisphere mid and high latitudes, energy balance regimes in the modern climate are less directly related to the vertical structure of the warming response. In the Northern midlatitudes, there is a phase shift between the seasonality of energy balance regimes in the modern climate and the seasonality of the lapse rate change (compare thick orange line to filled contours in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-dtemp}). This discrepancy is similar to the phase shift between the seasonality of energy balance and lapse rate regimes in the modern climate (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}a and \ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}b). This suggests that seasonal atmospheric heat storage may again be playing a role in delaying the seasonality of the lapse rate change relative to that of energy balance regimes.}

\added{The Northern high latitudes exhibit significant changes in energy balance regimes in response to warming (compare solid and dashed blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:cmip5-dtemp}), which coincide with significant changes in the advective heat flux into the Arctic, especially during summertime (not shown). Thus, the assumptions required for using energy balance regimes in the modern climate to interpret the warming response are not satisfied in the Arctic.}

\subsection{Summary}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We quantified \deleted{when and where }energy balance regimes \deleted{are observed}\added{in the modern climate}\replaced{,}{ and} their \replaced{link}{connection} to lapse rate\deleted{s} \added{regimes,} \replaced{and their response to warming}{for Earth's modern climate}. We used the vertically-integrated \replaced{moist static energy}{MSE} budget to define a nondimensional number \replaced{$R_1=(\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm))/R_a$}{$R_1=\frac{\partial_t m + \partial_y (vm)}{R_a}$} that quantifies regions of RCE ($R_1\le0.1$), RAE ($R_1\ge0.9$), and RCAE ($0.1<R_1<0.9$). In the annual mean, the RCE regime occurs equatorward of $40^\circ$, \replaced{consistent with the occurence of the moist adiabatic lapse rate regime}{where the free tropospheric lapse rate deviates less than 13\% from a moist adiabat}. The RAE regime occurs poleward of $80^\circ$N and $70^\circ$S\added{,} consistent with \replaced{the occurence of the}{where} surface inversion\replaced{ lapse rate regime}{s occur}. Lastly, the RCAE regime occurs between $40$ to $70^\circ$S and $40$ to $80^\circ$N, \replaced{consistent with the occurence of the mixed lapse rate regime (more stable than a moist adiabat but does not exhibit a surface inversion)}{where the free tropospheric lapse rate deviates 13\% to 35\% from a moist adiabat}.

Energy balance and lapse rate regimes\added{ in the modern climate} exhibit weak seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, regime transitions occur from RCAE to RCE in the midlatitudes and from RAE to RCAE in the high latitudes. The lapse rate also shows seasonal regime transitions in the Northern mid and high latitudes, but there is a phase shift relative to the energy balance regime transition by 1 to 3 months. In the Northern midlatitudes, this phase shift is associated with the seasonality of atmospheric storage.

A linear decomposition of the $R_1$ seasonality show\replaced{s}{ed} that the regime transition in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes is \replaced{associated}{consistent} with the large seasonality of advection plus atmospheric storage. We hypothesized using an EBM that surface heat capacity controls the amplitude of advection plus storage and thus the seasonal regime transition in the Northern midlatitudes. The hypothesis was confirmed by varying the mixed layer depth in aquaplanet simulations. As predicted by the EBM, aquaplanet simulations show that the \replaced{amplitude}{seasonality} of\added{ the} $R_1$\added{ seasonality} increases as the mixed layer depth decreases. The midlatitude regime transition occurs for mixed layer depths less than 20 m in the aquaplanet.\added{ The phase of $R_1$ is also a function of the mixed layer depth in the aquaplanet, where the RCE regime transition occurs earlier in the season for shallower mixed layer depths.} The importance of surface heat capacity on the seasonal amplitude of advection plus storage in the midlatitudes is consistent with \cite{barpanda2020}.

To understand the seasonality of energy balance regimes in the high latitudes, we tested the importance of sea ice for a polar ocean (Arctic) and topography for a polar continent (Antarctica) using mechanism\replaced{-}{ }denial experiments. \added{In the annual mean, the RAE regime only occurs over a polar ocean when thermodynamic sea ice is enabled. The energy balance regime seasonality depends on the seasonality of sea ice, which itself depends on the mixed layer depth in the aquaplanet. For shallower (25 to 40~m) mixed layer depths, RAE occurs from September to April when sea ice fraction, thickness, and surface albedo are large yearround. For deeper (45 and 50~m) mixed layer depths, RAE disappears in the fall when sea ice fraction, thickness, and surface albedo are small.} \deleted{In an aquaplanet with thermodynamic sea ice, the high latitudes undergo a regime transition from RAE to RCAE and the aquaplanet captures the seasonality of the Northern high latitudes. However, without sea ice, the aquaplanet remained in RCAE yearround confirming the importance of sea ice. }Using the CESM experiments conducted by \cite{hahn2020}, we found that \replaced{Antarctic topography alone cannot explain the lack of a high latitude regime transition over Antarctica}{the influence of Antarctic topography is confined to winter, and as a result the Southern high latitudes remain in RAE yearround regardless of the presence of Antarctic topography}.

\added{Finally, we showed that energy balance regimes in the modern climate can be used to interpret the vertical structure of the warming response in the annual mean, and seasonally in the tropics and the Southern high latitudes. In the annual mean, regions of RCE in the modern climate that remain in RCE in the future exhibit amplified warming aloft. Regions of RAE in the modern climate that remain in RAE in the future exhibit amplified warming at the surface. Similar results hold seasonally in the tropics and the Southern high latitudes. However, in the Northern Hemisphere mid and high latitudes, the seasonality of energy balance regimes in the modern climate is less directly related to the warming response due to the role of atmospheric heat storage in the midlatitudes and large changes in energy balance regimes in the Arctic.}

\subsection{Discussion}
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our findings are consistent with \cite{jakob2019}, who \replaced{showed that the tropics are close to RCE over large temporal ($>5000$ km) and spatial (>daily) time scales}{found that the tropics are near a state of RCE in the annual mean over a sufficiently large spatial average} (achieved here through taking the zonal mean). \cite{jakob2019} use the DSE budget to define RCE and primarily focus on the implications of the validity of RCE in the context of CRM configurations and convective aggregation in the tropics. Our work focuses on the nondimensional MSE budget, which has the advantage that it can be used as a more general criterion for defining energy balance regimes outside the tropics and in climates different from \replaced{Earth's modern climate}{modern Earth}.

The energy balance regimes defined here were based on the vertically-integrated MSE budget. The vertically-integrated budget is useful but it may have limitations when the vertical structure of advection, atmospheric storage, and radiation are important. For example, the discrepancy between the seasonality of energy balance and lapse rate regimes in the Northern high latitudes may be related to different vertical structures of advection and atmospheric storage. Extending the RAE model of \cite{cronin2016} to explicitly include atmospheric storage would be helpful for understanding the discrepancy. 

While the mechanism\replaced{-}{ }denial experiments involving sea ice \replaced{show that sea ice is a necessary condition to reproduce the seasonality of energy balance regimes in the Northern high latitudes}{were successful for understanding the seasonality of energy balance regimes in the Northern high latitudes},\added{ further experiments are necessary to 1) understand the discrepancy between the timing of energy balance and lapse rate regimes in the reanalysis data and 2) isolate the importance of the seasonally varying effective surface heat capacity and surface albedo effect of sea ice. Progress on 1) can be made by increasing the complexity of the sea ice representation (e.g., adding zonal asymmetry, sea ice dynamics) until the discrepancy in the timing of energy balance and lapse rate regimes can be reproduced. Progress on 2) can be made by running experiments with sea ice where the surface albedo is prescribed.}

\added{Our understanding of the Southern high latitude energy balance regime seasonality remains incomplete. In particular,} experiments involving topography\added{ and a seasonally invariant high albedo} were not successful in\added{ explaining the lack of a summertime regime transition in} the Southern high latitudes. Future work \replaced{could test the sensitivity of the results to variations in surface albedo beyond the range explored here, the role of alternative mechanisms such as clouds and the large-scale circulation, or the confluence of multiple mechanisms.}{should focus on the importance of alternative mechanisms such as the surface boundary condition (continent vs ocean) and clouds.}

\added{The connection between energy balance regimes in the modern climate and the vertical structure of the global warming response demonstrated here using state-of-the-art GCMs complements the findings of \cite{payne2015}. However, a complete understanding of the latitudinal and seasonal structure of the vertical temperature response in the Northern Hemisphere mid and high latitudes and Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes requires further investigation. Previous studies show the vertical structure of the warming response in the RAE model is sensitive to the type of forcing \citep{payne2015,cronin2016}. Thus, decomposing the change in $R_1$ into dynamic and radiative components and investigating their link to the warming response may be a fruitful direction for future work.}

The framework we introduced for quantifying energy balance regimes can be used to explore many interesting areas for future work. \replaced{T}{First, t}he framework can be extended to study the zonal structure of energy balance regimes.\added{ The role of zonal variations in surface heat capacity (land versus ocean) may be explored for the timing and amplitude of the Northern Hemisphere regime transitions.}\deleted{ Second, the framework can be used to understand the importance of sea ice on RAE and polar amplification in response to CO$_2$ through its control on the albedo and lapse rate feedback (Feldl et al. 2020).} \replaced{T}{Finally, t}he framework can \added{also }be applied to \replaced{quantify}{past and future climates to understand the potential for} energy balance regime transitions\deleted{ through time}\added{ in various paleoclimates}. Previous studies suggest that high latitudes during warm epochs, such as the Eocene, may have been close to RCE \citep{abbot2008a} whereas RAE was more widespread during Snowball Earth \citep{pierrehumbert2005}. These are all exciting areas for future work.

\appendix[A]
\appendixtitle{Lapse rate deviation from the moist adiabat}
We use a centered finite difference of monthly pressure level temperature and geopotential data to compute the lapse rate and convert to sigma coordinates by masking out the data below surface pressure and taking a cubic spline interpolation. We perform this conversion for every latitude and longitude grid point. 

Following \cite{stone1979}, we define the deviation of the lapse rate from the moist adiabatic lapse rate as the fractional difference:
  \begin{equation}
    \delta_{c} = \frac{\Gamma_{m}-\Gamma}{\Gamma_{m}}
  \end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ is the actual lapse rate in the reanalysis or GCM and $\Gamma_m$ is the moist adiabatic lapse rate as defined in equation~(3) in \cite{stone1979}.

\appendix[B]
\appendixtitle{Differences between the CMIP5 historical multimodel mean and the reanalysis mean}
In the reanalysis mean, there is a location of anomalously stable stratification between $\sigma=0.9$ to 0.7 for $R_1=0$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-binned-r1}). This leads to a nonmonotonic relationship between the lapse rate deviation and $R_1$ in the viscinity of $\sigma=0.8$. In comparison, the lower tropospheric stability does not show a similarly pronounced peak and the lapse rate deviation is monotonic with respect to $R_1$ for the CMIP5 multimodel mean (Fig.~B1).

In the reanalysis mean, there is a clear hemispheric asymmetry in the high latitude $R_1$ seasonality (compare Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}a and \ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}c). In addition, there is a corresponding asymmetry in the seasonality of the boundary layer lapse rate, where the lapse rate deviation in the Northern high latitudes indicates that the inversion vanishes during summertime whereas the inversion persists yearround in the Southern high latitudes (Fig.~\ref{fig:rea-r1-dev}c). The asymmetry differs somewhat in the CMIP5 multimodel mean. Notably, $R_1$ exhibits stronger seasonality in the Southern Hemisphere and approaches the margin of the RCAE regime during summertime (compare Fig.~B6c and \ref{fig:rea-r1-decomp-pole}c). Consistent with an energy balance state on the margin of RCAE, the inversion vanishes in the Southern high latitudes during summertime (Fig.~B3c).

\appendix[C]
\appendixtitle{Deriving an analytical expression for $\Delta R_1$ as a function of mixed layer depth}
Following the \cite{rose2017} EBM, we write the seasonality of TOA and SFC fluxes as a Fourier--Legendre series. Here we only consider the first harmonic as it is an order of magnitude larger than the second harmonic in the midlatitudes:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\Delta F_{\mathrm{TOA}} \approx a\Delta Q - B\Delta T_{s}$, where $a\Delta Q = Q^{*}\cos(\omega t)$. $\omega=2\pi$ yr$^{-1}$, $Q^{*}=as_{11}Q_{g}P_{1}(\phi)$ is the amplitude of net TOA shortwave radiation, $s_{11}=-2\sin{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the obliquity, $P_1(\phi) = \sin\phi$, and $Q_{g}=340$~W~m$^{-2}$. 
      \item $\Delta T_{s} = T_{s}^{*}\cos(\omega t - \Phi)$, where $T_{s}^{*}$ is the amplitude of surface temperature seasonality and $\Phi$ is the phase shift of $\Delta T_{s}$ relative to $\Delta Q$. $T_{s}^{*}=Q^{*}\left[(B+2D)^{2}+(\rho c_w d \omega)^{2}\right]^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi=\arctan\left(\frac{\rho c_w d \omega}{B+2D}\right)$ (see \cite{rose2017} for the derivation of the analytical expression of surface temperature).
    \end{itemize}
  Using the results above, we can write equation~(\ref{eq:mse-toasfc-approx}) as
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear3}
    \Delta R_{1} = \frac{1}{\overline{R_{a}}}\left(Q^{*}\cos(\omega t) -BT_s^{*}\cos(\omega t - \Phi)+\rho c_{w} d \omega T_{s}^{*}\sin(\omega t - \Phi) \right) \, .
  \end{equation}
  Substituting in $T_{s}^{*}$ and $\Phi$ and simplifying, we obtain
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear4-deriv}
    \Delta R_{1} = \frac{Q^{*}}{\overline{R_{a}}}\frac{2D}{(B+2D)^{2}+(\rho c_w d \omega)^{2}}\left[(B+2D)\cos(\omega t)+\rho c_w d \omega \sin(\omega t)\right] \, .
  \end{equation}
