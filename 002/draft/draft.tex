\abstract{Conceptual models of an atmospheric column provide a basis to understand the vertical temperature profile and its response to climate change. Specifically, Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE) and Radiative-Advective Equilibrium (RAE) are the standard idealized models for investigating tropical and polar climate change, respectively. Currently we do not have a complete understanding of the spatio-temporal structure of RCE and RAE. Here we use the vertically-integrated Moist Static Energy budget to define a non-dimensional number that quantifies when and where RCE and RAE are approximately satisfied in observations and models. We find RCE exists year-round in the deep tropics and in the northern midlatitudes during summertime. RAE exists year-round poleward of $\approx 70^{\circ}$ latitude. We show the stratification in RCE and RAE regimes in both reanalyses and GCMs are consistent with a moist adiabatic and stable near-surface temperature profile, respectively. Finally, we vary the mixed layer depth in idealized aquaplanet simulations with thermodynamic sea ice to test the following hypotheses: 1) the RCE regime occurs during midlatitude summer for land-like (small heat capacity) surface conditions and 2) the equatorward edge of the RAE regime is determined by the sea ice edge. We find that an aquaplanet model configured with a 20 m slab ocean (NH-like) transitions to RCE in the summer whereas the 40 m slab ocean (SH-like) does not.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We introduce a non-dimensional metric $R_{1}$ for identifying heat transfer regimes.
\item Vertical temperature profiles are a monotonic function of $R_{1}$, making $R_{1}$ a suitable metric to define heat transfer regimes and their associated temperature profiles (Fig. 1(a,b)).
  \item RCE exists yearround in the deep tropics and in the NH midlatitudes during summer. RAE exists yearround poleward of 70 S in the Antarctic but only during winter in the Arctic (Figs. 3(a) and 4(a)).
  \item In the NH winter, the observed stratification is more stable than a moist adiabat in the midlatitudes and exhibits a near surface inversion in the high latitudes, consistent with the expected temperature profiles for RCAE and RAE regimes, respectively (Fig. 3(b) and 4(b)).
  \item In NH summer, the observed stratification is moist adiabatic in the midlatitudes and does not exhibit a near surface inversion in the high latitudes, consistent with RCE and RCAE regimes, respectively (Figs. 3(c) and 4(c)).
  \item The observed stratification is more stable than a moist adiabat in the SH midlatitudes and exhibits a near surface inversion in the SH high latitudes yearround, consistent with RCAE and RAE regimes, respectively (Figs. 3(d,e) and 4(d,e)).
  \item The seasonality of $R_{1}$ in the midlatitudes mostly follows the seasonality of MSE flux divergence. Thus, the asymmetry in the seasonality of MSE flux divergence explains the hemispheric asymmetry in the midlatitude regime transitions (Fig. 6(a,b) and 7(a,b)).
  \item Modifying the surface heat capacity in an aquaplanet captures the hemispheric asymmetry in the seasonality of MSE flux divergence and $R_{1}$ (Figs. 10(a,b)). The strong seasonality of MSE flux divergence in the NH midlatitudes is consistent with a lower heat capacity (20 m mixed layer depth) and the weak seasonality of MSE flux divergence in the SH midlatitudes is consistent with a higher heat capacity (40 m mixed layer depth). The control of mixed layer depth on MSE flux divergence seasonality is consistent with Barpanda and Shaw (2020).
  \item On modern Earth, the melting of sea ice appears to be a necessary condition for RCAE in the high latitudes:
  \item In other words, our current hypothesis is that the presence of sea ice that is not melting is a necessary and sufficient condition for high latitude RAE.

\section{Introduction}

    At the most basic level, climate can be described as the mechanical and thermal processes that a planet undergoes in order to achieve energy balance with the insolation it receives from its star. For the atmosphere, a simple and useful starting point is the energy balance of an atmospheric column, which can be expressed as the vertically-integrated moist static energy (MSE) equation:
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:mse}
        \frac{\partial \langle h \rangle}{\partial t} + {\underbrace{\nabla\cdot \langle F_{m}\rangle}_{\text{advection}}} = {\underbrace{\vphantom{\langle F_{m}\rangle} R_{a}}_\text{radiation}} + {\underbrace{\vphantom{\langle F_{m}\rangle} \mathrm{LH+SH}}_\text{conduction}} \, ,
    \end{equation}
    where $h=c_p T + gz + Lq$ is MSE, $F_m$ is the MSE flux, $R_a$ is radiative cooling, $\mathrm{LH}$ is surface latent flux, $\mathrm{SH}$ is surface sensible heat flux, and $\langle \cdot \rangle$ is the mass-weighted vertical integral \citep{neelin1987}. As labeled in equation~(\ref{eq:mse}), the energy balance is maintained through three types of heat ransfer: radiation, conduction, and advection.
    
    Because conduction occurs through the bottom boundary and advection through the horizontal boundary of the atmospheric column, conductive and advective heat transfer can be loosely associated with two distinct forms of atmospheric dynamics: deep convection and baroclinic eddies. The connection can be understood in terms of the orientation of the heat fluxes. Convection is associated with a column where the heat flux is oriented vertically and baroclinicity where heat flux is oriented horizontally\footnote{While baroclinic eddies also transport heat vertically (vertical advective heat flux), this term cannot be diagnosed from the vertically-integrated equation; hence, we emphasize that the connection between the heat transfer types and dynamical regimes are loosely made.}.

    As the dominant forms of heat transfer are a strong function of latitude, simple climate models commonly assume simplified states of energy balance, or idealized heat transfer regimes. As simple climate models are an integral part of the climate model hierarchy and form the basis of our understanding of the climate system, it is important to understand when and where idealized heat transfer regimes are satisfied.
    
    In the low latitudes, atmospheric radiative cooling is primarily balanced by latent heating associated with convection \citep{riehl1958}. Thus, Radiative-Convective equilibrium (RCE) has become a standard idealized configuration for modeling the tropics of varying complexity, ranging from 1-D theories \citep[e.g.,][]{emanuel1996,nilsson1999,romps2014,singh2015} to 3-D cloud resolving model simulations \citep[][and the references therein]{wing2018}. RCE in the tropics is commonly associated with a convectively neutral temperature profile \citep{singh2013}, which in the simplest form can be characterized as near-moist adiabatic \citep[e.g.,][]{held1982,robe1996,tompkins1998}.

    In the high latitudes, radiative fluxes are primarily balanced by advective heat transport associated with the large-scale circulation \citep{nakamura1988}. Accordingly, \cite{cronin2016} recently proposed Radiative-Advective Equilibrium (RAE) as an idealized configuration for modeling the vertical temperature profile of the polar regions. Temperature profiles of RAE typically feature a near-surface temperature inversion because the surface can cool efficiency through the atmospheric window and the vertical profile of advective heat transport peaks slightly above the surface \citep[e.g.,][]{hahn2020}.
    
    Finally in the midlatitudes, all three types of heat transfer are important. We introduce the term Radiative-Convective-Advective Equilibrium (RCAE) to describe this heat transfer regime. RCAE is the idealized configuration for Energy Balance Models (EBM), which has been used to successfully study the latitudinal structure of surface temperature across a range of climates \citep{north1975}. The vertical temperature profile of RCAE are more stable than a moist adiabat \citep{schneider2008} due to the sensible and latent heating associated with baroclinic eddies.
    
    Categorizing latitudinal regions based on heat transfer regimes makes it straightforward to understand the temperature response to perturbations. For example, the warming response to increased CO$_2$ maximizes aloft in the tropics, which is characteristic of RCE and moist adiabatic adjustment \citep{held1993a,romps2011}. In contrast, the warming response maximizes at the surface in the polar regions consistent with the near-surface stable lapse rate of RAE \citep{payne2015,cronin2016}. Heat transfer regimes provide a quantitative definition for the boundaries of tropical and polar regions, which are known to change with forcing. For example, the tropics expand in response to increased CO$_2$ \citep{seidel2007} and the polar regions expand during Snowball Earth \citep{pierrehumbert2005}.
    
    Although the importance of understanding the spatio-temporal structure of idealized heat transfer regimes are clear, to date very few studies have quantified when and where RCE and RAE are observed. In particular, \cite{jakob2019} quantifies the spatial and temporal scales where RCE is approximately satisfied in the annual mean by using the dry static energy (DSE) budget. They define approximate RCE as where the DSE flux convergence is less than 50 Wm$^{-2}$. However, the DSE framework is problematic for identifying heat transfer regimes outside of the tropics because it neglects latent heat as a form of advective heat flux. Furthermore, a fixed dimensional threshold does not work as a general criteria, such as when considering heat transfer regimes in the context of climate change.
    
    Here, we develop a new framework for defining heat transfer regimes for quantifying when and where RCE and RAE regimes occur in the annual mean and seasonally for the modern Earth as a first step toward understanding changes in different climates. Heat transfer regimes are defined using a nondimensional number that arises upon nondimensionalizing the moist static energy (MSE) budget by the radiative cooling term. 

\section{Methods}

    \subsection{Defining heat transfer regimes using the nondimensionalized MSE budget}

     We nondimensionalize Equation (\ref{eq:mse}) by dividing by radiative cooling, \(R_{a}\), which is negative definite on modern Earth. The nondimensionalized MSE budget is
    \begin{equation}
        {\underbrace{\frac{\frac{\partial \langle h \rangle}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \langle F_{m} \rangle }{R_{a}}}_{R_1}} = 1 + {\underbrace{\frac{\mathrm{LH+SH}}{R_{a}}}_{R_2}} \, ,
    \end{equation}
    where we introduce two nondimensional numbers, $R_1$ and $R_2$. In the annual mean, $R_1\approx\frac{\nabla\cdot F_m}{R_a}$ and thus quantifies the relative importance of horizontal fluxes through an atmospheric column. $R_2$ quantifies the relative importance of vertical fluxes through the atmospheric column. The same interpretation of $R_1$ also applies through the seasonal cycle in the low latitudes where $\partial_t h$ is one order of magnitude smaller than $\nabla\cdot F_m$. However, in the mid and high latitudes, $|\partial_t h|\sim 50$ Wm$^{-2}$ around equinox and thus $R_1$ quantifies the relative importance of both horizontal fluxes and the MSE tendency. Our choice to include $\partial_t h$ in the definition of $R_1$ is motivated by the fact that $\partial_t h$ becomes absorbed with the advective term in the Lagrangian perspective of an atmospheric column and that the spatio-temporal structure of $R_1$ defined this way is more consistent with the spatio-temporal structure of lapse rate regimes than when defined excluding the $\partial_t h$ term.
    
    Strict radiative convective equilibrium requires that all fluxes in the column be oriented in the vertical direction (i.e., \(R_{1}=0\)). This is only satisfied in the global mean and where the MSE flux divergence changes sign in the subtropics, so we define approximate radiative convective equilibrium as regions where the MSE flux convergence is negligibly small or the MSE flux is divergent (\(R_{1}\le \epsilon\)). We choose to allow all magnitudes of positive MSE flux divergence because the MSE flux divergence in the deep tropics is comprised of upper level divergence and lower level convergence, both of which further destabilizes the column and incite convective activity. That is, although states of large negative $R_1$ do not amount to strict RCE from an energy balance perspective, the dynamics and its control on the lapse rate are expected to behave similarly to RCE \citep[e.g., see][]{warren2020}.
    
    Strict radiative advective equilibrium as defined in \cite{cronin2016} requires that all fluxes be in the horizontal direction (i.e., \(R_{2}=0\) or equivalently \(R_{1}=1\)). To be consistent with the approximate definition of RCE, we define approximate radiative advective equilibrium as regions where positive surface turbulent fluxes are small or the surface turbulent fluxes are negative (\(R_{2} \ge -\epsilon \) or equivalently \(R_{1} \ge 1-\epsilon\)). Similar to the argument for RCE, while $R_1$ significantly larger than 1 do not amount to strict RAE from an energy balance perspective, we label this regime as approximate RAE as we expect the near-surface inversion to further strengthen in the presence of negative surface turbulent fluxes (directed from the atmosphere to the surface).
    
    Tropospheric temperature profiles are a monotonic function of $R_{1}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:temp-binned-r1}(a,b)). Thus, $R_{1}$ is a useful metric for identifying heat transfer regimes and its associated vertical temperature profiles. We choose the threshold for approximate RCE and RAE as $\epsilon=0.1$ on the basis that the near-surface inversion exists for $R_{1} \ge 0.9$ (bold lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:temp-binned-r1}(a,b)).
    
    In summary, we define RCE as regions that satisfy \(R_{1}\le 0.1\) and RAE as regions that satisfy \(R_{1}\ge 0.9\). We identify intermediate values of \(R_{1}\) (i.e. \(0.1 < R_{1} < 0.9\)) as RCAE, where radiation, convection, and advection all contribute to its vertical temperature profile.

    \subsection{Data}

    We use the ERA5 reanalysis data to evaluate heat transfer regimes in the observed modern Earth and the historical run of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive for state-of-the-art climate model simulations of modern Earth. We perform our analysis on a monthly climatology averaged between 1979 and 2005, which corresponds to the time period where both ERA5 and CMIP5 historical data are both available. 
  
    \subsubsection{ERA5 Reanalysis}
    
    ERA5 is the latest generation reanalysis product provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts \citep{hersbach2020}. $R_a$, $\mathrm{LH}$, and $\mathrm{SH}$ are available as part of the standard single level output in ERA5. While the surface turbulent fluxes are known to be poorly constrained in reanalyses \citep{dee2021} and thus are usually inferred as the residual \citep[e.g.,][]{trenberth2001,fasullo2008,donohoe2013}, in this study we infer $\partial_t \langle h \rangle + \nabla\cdot\langle F_m \rangle$ as the sum $R_a + \mathrm{LH} + \mathrm{SH}$ to compute $R_1$. We choose to use the output of surface turbulent fluxes here because we are interested in verifying the diagnosed heat transfer regimes with the expected vertical temperature profiles of each regime and the near surface temperature and turbulent fluxes are tightly coupled through the bulk aerodynamic formula parameterization.
    
    \subsubsection{CMIP5 Historical Runs}
    
    The historical run of the CMIP5 archive are atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) forced with the historically observed atmospheric composition evolution. We obtain a multimodel mean of the CMIP5 historical run that is comprised of 41 models. As with ERA5, we use the output of $R_a$, $\mathrm{LH}$, and $\mathrm{SH}$ and infer $\partial_t \langle h \rangle + \nabla\cdot\langle F_m \rangle$ as the sum $R_a + \mathrm{LH} + \mathrm{SH}$.

    \subsection{ECHAM6 slab ocean aquaplanet experiments}
    
    We use the ECHAM6 atmospheric general circulation model configured as a slab ocean aquaplanet to determine the dominant physical mechanisms that lead to heat transfer regime transitions in the annual cycle. In particular, we hypothesize that 1) the mixed layer depth controls the seasonal amplitude and phase of $R_1$ and thus the existence of summertime RCE in the midlatitudes and 2) sea ice controls the existence of wintertime RAE in the high latitudes. ECHAM6 is the atmospheric component of the MPI-ESM-LR GCM \citep{stevens2013}. We vary the mixed layer depth from 2--50 m in the standard configuration of the ECHAM6 aquaplanet without sea ice to test the sensitivity of midlatitude RCE to the surface heat capacity. We run additional experiments with ECHAM6 where thermodynamic sea ice is enabled as in \cite{shaw2020} to test whether sea ice is a necessary condition for wintertime RAE.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

    \subsection{Meriodional structure of RCE and RAE in the annual mean}
    
    In the annual mean, RCE is satisfied in the low latitudes and RAE in the high latitudes, as expected (Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-ann}(a)). The spatial structure of $R_1$ closely follows the structure of MSE flux divergence because the zonally averaged radiative cooling is nearly uniform. The temporally and spatially averaged temperature profile over the RCE regime is close to moist adiabatic in both the NH (orange line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-ann}(b)) and SH (orange line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-ann}(c)). The temporally and spatially averaged temperature profile over the RAE regime exhibits a near surface inversion (blue lines in Figs.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-ann}(b) and (c)). The inversion is stronger in the SH, consistent with the higher values of $R_{1}$ indicating that it is in a stronger state of RAE. Over the RCAE regime, the temporally and spatially averaged temperature profile is more stable than a moist adiabat and does not exhibit a near surface inversion, distinct from both RCE and RAE regimes (gray lines in Figs.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-ann}(b) and (c)).
    
    \subsection{Seasonality of RCE and RAE}
    
    The seasonality of \(R_{1}\) in the mid and high latitudes is larger in the NH (Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}). The strong increase in \(R_{1}\) during NH summer drives a regime transition from RCAE to RCE in the NH midlatitudes and from RAE to RCAE in the NH high latitudes.
  
    The seasonality of vertical temperature profiles are consistent with the diagnosed heat transfer regimes in both the NH and SH. For example, the temperature profile at 45$^{\circ}$ N in January is significantly more stable than a moist adiabat (compare solid to dashed gray lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(b)) while the temperature profile in July is close to a moist adiabat (compare solid to dashed orange lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(c)). Similarly, the temperature profile at 85 $^{\circ}$ N in January exhibits a strong near surface inversion (blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(b)) while no surface inversion is present in July (gray line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(c)). In the SH, the temperature profile at 45$^{\circ}$S remains more stable than a moist adiabat yearround (gray lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(d,e)), consistent with $R_{1}$ indicating that the SH midlatitudes is in a state of RCAE yearround. The temperature profile at 85$^{\circ}$S exhibits a near surface inversion yearround (blue lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(d,e)), consistent with $R_{1}$ indicating that the SH high latitudes is in a state of RAE yearround.
    
    More generally, the spatio-temporal structure of the critical \(R_{1}\) values for RCE (\(R_{1}\le 0.1\)) and RAE (\(R_{1}\ge 0.9\)) closely follow the structure of convective (\(\delta_{c}\le 10\%\)) and inversion (\(\delta_{i}\ge 90\%\)) lapse rate regimes, respectively (compare orange and cyan contours in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-dev}(a) with Figs.~A1 and A2).
    
    These results suggest that RCE and RAE as diagnosed by \(R_{1}\) is a good proxy for identifying convective and inversion lapse rate regimes.
    
    Next, in order to understand what physical mechanism is responsible for the hemispheric asymmetry in heat transfer regimes in the mid and high latitudes, we diagnose which terms in the MSE budget dominates the hemispheric asymmetry.


\subsection{Midlatitude regime transitions} \label{subsec:asym}
    We now focus on latitude bands in the midlatitudes (40--50$^{\circ}$ N/S) and the high latitudes (80--90$^{\circ}$ N/S) to understand what sets the difference in the seasonality of the RCE and RAE boundaries across the northern and southern hemisphere. We find that the transition from RCAE to RCE in the NH midlatitude summer (solid black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(a)) arises primarily due to a weakening of MSE flux convergence (red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(a)). The significant weakening of MSE flux convergence (red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(b)) comes from a combination of weaker radiative cooling (gray line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(b)) and stronger surface turbulent fluxes in the summer (blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(b)).
    
    In contrast, the SH midlatitudes remains in RCAE yearround (solid black line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(c)). As in the NH, the MSE flux convergence weakens during summer (red line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(d)) but the amplitude is smaller than in the NH. This can be attributed to the opposite phase of the seasonality of surface turbulent fluxes (blue line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(d)).
    
    \subsubsection{Varying mixed layer depth explains hemispheric asymmetry of RCE}
        When ECHAM AQUA is configured with a mixed layer depth of 20 m (shallower than the critical depth of 25 m derived earlier), the seasonality of \(R_{1}\) (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}(a)) closely resembles that of the NH midlatitudes (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(a)).
        
        The decrease of \(R_{1}\) in the summer months is associated with a weakening of MSE flux divergence and a strengthening of turbulent heat fluxes (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}(b)).
        
        The seasonality of turbulent heat fluxes in ECHAM appears to lag behind insolation by 2 months. Thus, the months of RCE is also shifted toward late summer/early fall.
        
        When ECHAM is configured with a mixed layer depth of 40 m (deeper than the critical depth of 25 m), the seasonal amplitude of \(R_{1}\) (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}(c)) is comparable to that of the SH midlatitudes (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(c)). Interestingly, \(R_{1}\) in the 40 m ECHAM run is nearly perfectly out of phase with \(R_{1}\) in the SH midlatitudes.
  
        The weaker amplitude of \(R_{1}\) is associated with a seasonality of turbulent heat fluxes that is out of phase with insolation (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rce}(d)).
  
\subsection{High latitude regime transitions}
    The transition from RAE to RCAE in the NH high latitude summer (Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-pole}(a)) arises due to strong weakening of the MSE flux convergence that is supported by a strengthening of the surface turbulent fluxes during NH summer (Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-pole}(b)).
    
    In contrast, the SH high latitudes remains in RAE yearround (Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-pole}(c)). The amplitude of the weakening MSE flux convergence and strengthening surface turbulent fluxes in SH summer are similar to those in the NH (Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-pole}(d)). However, the SH remains in RAE yearround because its annual mean state is farther away from the RAE boundary (see horizontal line in Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-pole}(c)).

    \subsubsection{Winter RAE requires sea ice}
        When ECHAM is configured without sea ice, the annual mean state in the high latitudes is in RCAE (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae}(a)). This can be attributed to positive turbulent fluxes that persist yearround in the absence of sea ice (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae}(b)).
        
        This holds for all mixed layer depths tested here (10--50 m).
        
        When ECHAM is configured with thermodynamic sea ice (40 m chosen here as it fits the NH high latitudes well), the annual mean state in the high latitudes is in RAE (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae}(c)). In the presence of sea ice, turbulent fluxes are negative most of the year (Fig.~\ref{fig:echam-rae}(d)). Only when the sea ice melts during the summer do positive turbulent fluxes arise, which drives the transition to RCAE.
        
        This holds for mixed layer depths between 25--50 m. For mixed layer depths below 20 m, a runaway ice-albedo feedback leads the model to equilibrate to a snowball climate.

\section{Summary and Discussion}
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item We find that the northern boundary of the convective lapse rate regime expands poleward to the NH midlatitudes during NH summer in both ERA5 and the CMIP5 multi-model mean. The southern boundary does not expand poleward during SH summer. The amplitude of the seasonality of the southern boundary is different in ERA-Interim (contracts equatorward in SH winter) compared to CMIP5HIST-ESM-LR (negligible contraction).
%   \item The equatorward boundary of the NH inversion lapse rate regime extends to \(60^{\circ}\) N during NH winter and vanishes during summer in both ERA-Interim and CMIP5HIST-ESM-LR. The boundary of the SH inversion lapse rate regime also vanishes during SH summer in ERA-Interim, whereas there is negligible migration of the boundary in CMIP5HIST-ESM-LR.

\appendixtitle{Convective and inversion lapse rate regimes}
\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We use a cubic spline interpolation to convert the temperature profile to sigma coordinates. We do this to avoid the issue of averaging out inversions that occur at various pressure or height levels in the presence of topography.
  \item Following \cite{stone1979}, we define the deviation of a lapse rate from a convective lapse rate as the percent difference from a moist adiabatic lapse rate:
        \begin{equation}
          \delta_{c} = \frac{\Gamma_{m}-\Gamma}{\Gamma_{m}}
        \end{equation}
  \item We vertically average \(\delta_{c}\) from 0.85--0.4 in linear sigma coordinates to obtain the free tropospheric deviation \(\langle \delta_{c} \rangle\).
  \item To quantify the presence of a near surface inversion, we define the deviation of a lapse rate from a dry adiabatic lapse rate in a similar manner:
        \begin{equation}
          \delta_{i} = \frac{\Gamma_{d}-\Gamma}{\Gamma_{d}}
        \end{equation}
  \item Note that \(\delta_{i}=1\) corresponds to an isothermal stratification and thus \(\delta_{i}>1\) indicates the presence of an inversion.
  \item We use the dry adiabat as the reference lapse rate here because in general the boundary layer (where the near surface inversion forms) is not saturated.
  \item We vertically average \(\delta_{i}\) from 1--0.85 in linear sigma coordinates to obtain the near surface deviation \(\langle \delta_{i} \rangle\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The free tropospheric stratification is either conditionally unstable (orange filled contours in Fig.~A1) or close to neutrally stable (white filled contours in Fig.~A1) to a saturated moist adiabat equatorward of 30$^{\circ}$ N/S yearround.
  \item Thus the tropical free tropospheric stratification is set by convection yearround.
  \item The northern boundary of the convective lapse rate regime migrates poleward out to 60$^{\circ}$ N in July (Fig.~A1).
  \item The seasonal expansion of the northern boundary of the convective regime is consistent with the results obtained by \cite{stone1979} (cf. their Fig. 7).
  \item The southern boundary of the convective lapse rate regime varies less throughout the annual cycle, expanding out to only 40$^{\circ}$ in January (Fig.~A1). The southern boundary contracts equatorward to 20$^{\circ}$ S during the SH winter in ERA-Interim (Fig.~A1(a)) whereas there is negligible contraction in MPI-ESM-LR.
  \item The near surface stratification exhibits an inversion (100\% contour in Fig.~A2) poleward of 60 $^{\circ}$ N and 70$^{\circ}$ S in the respective winter hemispheres.
  \item The southern boundary of the NH inversion lapse rate regime migrates poleward following the seasonality of insolation until the inversion vanishes in the summer.
  \item The northern boundary of the SH inversion lapse rate regime also migrates poleward and vanishes in the summer in ERA-Interim (Fig.~A2(a)) whereas there is negligible seasonality in MPI-ESM-LR (Fig.~A2(b)).
\end{itemize}

\appendix[C]
\appendixtitle{Analytical relationship between $R_{1}$ and mixed layer depth}
\begin{itemize}
  \item In order to understand what physical mechanisms are responsible for the hemispheric asymmetry, we work toward expressing $R_{1}$ in terms of external parameters.
  \item Section~\label{subsec:asym} showed that the existence of a midlatitude regime transition depends on the seasonality of $R_{1}$. Thus, we start by focusing on the seasonality of $R_{1}$ into independent contributions from the seasonality of MSE flux divergence and radiative cooling:
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear}
          \Delta R_{1} = \Delta\left(\frac{\nabla\cdot F_{m}}{R_{a}}\right) \approx \frac{1}{\overline{R_{a}}}\Delta(\nabla\cdot F_{m}) - \frac{\overline{\nabla\cdot F_{m}}}{\overline{R_{a}}^{2}}\Delta R_{a} \, ,
        \end{equation}
  \item where $\overline{(\cdot)}$ denotes the annual mean and $\Delta(\cdot)$ denotes the deviation from the annual mean. Fig.~\ref{fig:era5-r1-decomp-mid}(a,c) show that the second term on the RHS is smaller than the first term in the midlatitudes. Thus, we approximate
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-term1}
          \Delta R_{1} \approx \frac{1}{\overline{R_{a}}}\Delta(\nabla\cdot F_{m}) \, .
        \end{equation}
  \item To connect the seasonality of MSE flux divergence to external parameters in the climate system, we rewrite the MSE equation in terms of fluxes at the top of atmophere (TOA) and surface (SFC):
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:mse-toasfc}
          \frac{\partial \langle h \rangle}{\partial t} + \nabla\cdot \langle F_{m} \rangle = F_{\mathrm{TOA}} - F_{\mathrm{SFC}}
        \end{equation}
  \item The seasonality of MSE tendency is small, so we approximate the seasonality of each term in the MSE equation as
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:mse-toasfc-approx}
          \Delta (\nabla\cdot \langle F_{m} \rangle) \approx \Delta F_{\mathrm{TOA}} - \Delta F_{\mathrm{SFC}}
        \end{equation}
  \item Note that \(F_{\mathrm{SFC}}\) is defined to be positive from the atmosphere to the surface here, hence the negative sign.
  \item We can write the seasonality of surface fluxes using the surface energy budget of a mixed layer ocean:
        \begin{equation}
          \Delta F_{\mathrm{SFC}} = \Delta\left(\rho c_{w} d \frac{\partial T_{s}}{\partial t}\right) + \Delta ( \nabla\cdot F_{O})
        \end{equation}
  \item The seasonality of ocean flux divergence is negligible on the seasonal time scale \citep{roberts2017}, so we can approximately relate the seasonality of surface fluxes to the mixed layer depth (d):
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:sfc-simple}
          \Delta F_{\mathrm{SFC}} = \Delta\left(\rho c_{w} d \frac{\partial T_{s}}{\partial t}\right)
        \end{equation}
  \item We substitute Equation~(\ref{eq:mse-toasfc-approx}) and (\ref{eq:sfc-simple}) into (\ref{eq:r1-term1}):
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear2}
          \Delta R_{1} = \frac{1}{\overline{R_{a}}}\left(\Delta F_{\mathrm{TOA}}-\rho c_{w} d \Delta\frac{\partial T_{s}}{\partial t}\right) \, .
        \end{equation}
  \item Following \cite{rose2017}, we make the following assumptions to rewrite the RHS:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item $\Delta F_{\mathrm{TOA}} \approx a\Delta Q - B\Delta T_{s}$, where $a$ is the co-albedo, $Q$ is insolation, and $B$ is the sensitivity of OLR to surface temperature $T_{s}$.
          \item $\Delta Q = Q^{*}\cos(\omega t)$, where $Q^{*}=as_{11}Q_{g}P_{1}(x)$ is the amplitude of net TOA shortwave, $s_{11}=-2\sin{\beta}$ where $\beta$ is the obliquity, and $Q_{g}=340$ Wm$^{-2}$. For simplicity we only consider the annual mode.
          \item $\Delta T_{s} = T_{s}^{*}\cos(\omega t - \Phi)$, where $T_{s}^{*}$ is the amplitude of surface temperature and $\Phi$ is the phase shift of $\Delta T_{s}$ relative to $\Delta Q$.
          \item As with insolation, we only consider the annual mode, so $T_{s}^{*}=Q^{*}B^{-1}\left((1+2\delta)^{2}+\gamma^{2}\right)^{-1/2}$ and $\Phi=\arctan\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+2\delta}\right)$, where $\delta = \frac{K}{R^2 B}  = \frac{D}{B}$ is the nondimensionalized diffusivity parameter.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item Using the above assumptions, we can write Equation~(\ref{eq:r1-linear2}) as
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear3}
          \Delta R_{1} = \frac{1}{\overline{R_{a}}}\left(Q^{*}\cos(\omega t) -BT^{*}\cos(\omega t - \Phi)+\rho c_{w} d \omega T_{s}^{*}\sin(\omega t - \Phi) \right) \, .
        \end{equation}
  \item Substituting in $T_{s}^{*}$ and $\Phi$ and simplifying, we obtain
        \begin{equation} \label{eq:r1-linear4}
          \Delta R_{1} = \frac{Q^{*}}{\overline{R_{a}}}\frac{2\delta}{(1+2\delta)^{2}+\gamma^{2}}\left((1+2\delta)\cos(\omega t)+\gamma\sin(\omega t)\right) \, .
        \end{equation}
        \item While the predicted relationship between $T_{s}^{*}$ and the mixed layer depth agrees well with the ECHAM simulations (Fig.~B1(a)), the predicted amplitude of $R_{1}$ underestimates those in ECHAM (Fig.~B1(b)).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Critical mixed layer depth}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We can define a critical mixed layer depth ($d_{c}$) as the depth that corresponds to the threshold of the RCE/RCAE regime transition. The threshold of the RCE/RCAE regime transition is expressed as
        \begin{equation}
          \min(R_{1}) = \overline{R_{1}} + \min(\Delta R_{1}) = \epsilon
        \end{equation}
  \item From Equation~(\ref{eq:r1-linear4}), we can compute the expression for $\min(\Delta R_{1})$
        \begin{equation}
          \min(\Delta R_{1}) = \frac{Q^{*}}{\overline{R_{a}}\sqrt{1+\tilde{C}^{2}}}
        \end{equation}
  \item Thus the critical mixed layer depth $d_{c}$ is
        \begin{equation}
          d_{c} = \frac{B}{\rho c_{w} \omega}\sqrt{\left(\frac{Q^{*}}{\overline{R_{a}}(\epsilon-\overline{R_{1}})}\right)^{2}-1} \, .
        \end{equation}
\item For $B=2$ Wm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, $\rho=1000$ kg m$^{-3}$, $c_{w}=4000$ J kg$^{-1} $K$^{-1}$, $Q^{*}=200$ W m$^{-2}$, $\overline{R_{a}}=-100$ W m$^{-2}$, $\epsilon=0.1$, and $\overline{R_{1}}=0.3$, we obtain a critical mixed layer depth of 25 m.
