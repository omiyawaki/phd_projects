# Introduction

Action items from our previous meeting are:

-   Consider varying the bounds for taking the vertically averaged difference in lapse rate to quantify closeness to a moist adiabat.
-   Define near-surface stability using deviation from a dry adiabatic lapse rate.
-   Explore various thresholds for RCE and RAE where \(\gamma = 1-\epsilon\).
-   Check if the RCE/RAE thresholds are sensible for other climates such as the 4xCO2 and snowball climates.


# Vertically averaged deviation from adiabatic lapse rates

We expect regions of RCE to exhibit a convective (moist adiabatic) stratification in the free troposphere and regions of RAE to exhibit a stable stratification near the surface. Previously I used the vertically averaged deviation of the climatological lapse rate from a moist adiabatic lapse rate between 1000&#x2013;200 hPa to quantify the closeness of the stratification to moist adiabatic. In addition, I used the inversion strength as defined as the difference between \(\sigma=1.0\) and \(\sigma=0.85\) temperature to quantify the stability of the stratification near the surface. I now quantify near-surface stability using the vertically averaged deviation of the climatological lapse rate. However, I quantify this deviation from a dry adiabatic lapse rate as we do not expect the air to be saturated near the surface.

Both metrics are not significantly sensitive to the vertical bounds chosen to separate the boundary layer and the free troposphere (Fig. [8](#org9afc405) and [9](#orgaf4835c)). The deviation of the free tropospheric lapse rate from moist adiabatic in the tropics becomes more negative as the lower bound is farther lowered as the boundary layer is closer to dry than moist adiabatic (Fig. [8](#org9afc405)d).

# Next Steps

-   Fix albedo contour issue.
-   Use equation (11) in the proposal to decompose the seasonality of \(R_1\) into the seasonality of TOA energy imbalance and net surface fluxes.
-   Test physical mechanisms that control the seasonality of RCE and RAE using slab-ocean aquaplanet experiments.
