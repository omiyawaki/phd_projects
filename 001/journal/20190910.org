* DONE Change TFREEZE
* TODO Can we change L from a constant to L(T) in RAS?
* DONE Make schematic (a la expo talk) to illustrate hypothesis in a simple way
	- i.e., if L changes from condensation to sublimation at freezing, kink would be expected from shift in freezing level
	- likewise for entrainment - if tokioka parameter is altered, what do we expect?
* DONE prioritize looking at cli on CMIP models
	- in particular look at models with a large kink
* TODO look at entrainment and freezing separately in temperature coordinates
* DONE contact doug about quals: set a date for written exam
	- brainstorm ideas for the prospectus: set an internal deadline to complete a draft by mid-October
	- revise prospectus with tiffany and complete by end of October
	- take written exam by mid November (before thanksgiving)
	- oral exam in mid december
* maybe contact zhihong about am2 abrupt4xco2?
* look at gfdl am3 results
