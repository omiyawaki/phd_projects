Framing the large scale circulation: I did not understand what was meant when you wrote that the &ldquo;large-scale circulation&rdquo; contributed to the over-prediction, even after reading lines 65&#x2013;78 (which I had interpreted as a useful summary of interesting/relevant results by others). I initially thought you were referring to the CO\(_2\) effect on the circulation change. But the &ldquo;large-scale circulation&rdquo; simply means that a moist adiabatic response should really only be expected in regions of deep convection (and not in regions of large-scale descent). It wasn&rsquo;t until Section 3.2 that I understood what as meant and my reaction to Figure 2 was that &ldquo;no one expects a moist adiabatic scaling relative to the eastern Pacific surface temperature response.&rdquo; Perhaps making the meaning of &ldquo;large-scale circulation&rdquo; more clear with something like this (perhaps the topic sentence(s) or concluding sentence(s) 65&#x2013;78): &ldquo;The tropical atmospheric circulation is zonally asymmetric with regions of climatological ascent and descent. Since the tropospheric temperature is only expected to be coupled to the surface temperature in regions of deep atmospheric convection, a moist adiabatic temperature scaling does not necessarily hold in areas of large scale descent or in the tropical average. As such, the presence of the tropical atmospheric circulation may influence the scaling between tropical tropospheric and surface temperature change. In contrast, aquaplanets do not include a tropical, zonally symmetric circulation, and may adhere more closely to moist adiabatic warming throughout the tropics.&rdquo;

This manuscript includes a tremendous amount of information. At times, the many complementary (and subtly different) comparisons can dilute the take home messages. I think it would be extremely useful to try to incorporate the findings into a summary figure that could illustrate the estimated contribution that each process makes to the moist adiabatic warming over-estimation. For example, it is very helpful that you state the contribution to the over-prediction from the circulation and CO\(_2\) in the abstract. I don&rsquo;t think you actually state how you arrive at these estimates in the main text. I&rsquo;ve constructed a schematic of the type of figure I was thinking of (you could include other simulations, but I think the key is to allow the reader to see the contribution each process makes to the over-prediction). This would essentially combine the information of Figure 1 and 3.

A similar comment regarding the presentation in the text. The average over-prediction values are listed in Sections 3.1&#x2013;3.3 (rather than the estimate change attributed to each physical process). It would be extremely helpful to 1) re-order the presentation of experiments into a more linear narrative, 2) emphasize a subset of the experiments (and use the others of further evidence of your claims), and 3) focus more on the impact of each process (rather than the mean over-prediction for each experiment). For example, you could:

-   start by stating in Section 3.1 that the over-prediction is \(23.7\%\) in abrupt4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) and the magnitude is similar in amipFuture+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) and amip4K+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) runs (\(20.1\) and \(21.1\%\)).
-   then in Section 3.2, you could state that when you look in regions of deep convection, the abrupt4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) over-prediction drops by \(7.1\%\) to \(16.6\%\). This is supported by the results from the amipFuture+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) and amip4K simulations where the overprediction drops by \(7.1\) and \(3.8\%\). Last, you could point out that the over-prediction in aqua4K+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) is similar to the amipFuture+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) and amip4K+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\) simulations (as you do in lines 292&#x2013;294).
-   in Section 3.3, you could shift your focus to the amipFuture+4\(\times\)CO\(_2\)/amipFuture simulations and state that when you remove the direct effect of CO\(_2\) the overprediction falls by \(3.7\%\) to \(9.3\%\). As support, you could note that AMIP and aqua simulations also show declines in the over-prediction when the effects of CO\(_2\) changes are removed.
-   in section 3.4 you could state that entrainment also contributes to the over-prediction (and perhaps state an estimate from the GFDL model experiments).
-   this narrative would mean that in each section, you are removing one piece of complexity (first circulation, then CO\(_2\), then entrainment) and emphasizing a subset of experiments (e.g., abrupt+amip, and using the others to bolster your claims, e.g., aqua). I think this would make it a bit easier to follow an dunderstand what the many experiments are telling us.

Line 15: Consider making it clear that warming is amplified relative to the surface (or lower troposphere) by inserting &ldquo;surface.&rdquo; Here you say that the amplification is in response to CO\(_2\) increases, but in other places you are careful to say that it is due to surface warming (and not the direct effect of CO\(_2\)).

Line 21: It wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear how to interpret these numbers, because the range of overprediction is large across CMIP5. So this would account for \(\approx40\%\) or \(\approx75\%\) of the over-prediction, depending on the CMIP5 model considered.

\textbf{TODO: discuss and respond.}

Plain Language Summary: There are some places where this reads a bit jargon-y and emphasizes detailed, field specific results rather than broader take-home messages. Consider simplifying this a bit and/or focusing on the implications for the research. For example, you could center the discussion around rising plumes (which leads to thermodynamic heating as water vapor condenses into clouds and rain droplets). This would allow you to substitute out some specialty-specific language such as &ldquo;mixing of dry environmental air into moist ascent&rdquo; into something like &ldquo;dry air mixes into the rising plume, which dilutes the water vapor content and reduces warming from condensation.&rdquo; I view this as an optional editorial comment since plain-language summaries are new enough where there isn&rsquo;t a standard on which audience these should be geared to.

# Reviewer 2

The paper investigates the deviation in the upper-troposphere warming from a simple moist-adiabat prediction. It shows that moist adiabat over-predicts the upper-tropospheric warming because of effects from large-scale circulation, direct CO\(_2\) effect, and entrainment. The results are overall convincing but there are a few key points that need to be clarified.

Line 170: The moist adiabatic profile is sensitive to where the air parcel is initially lifted from. The paper chooses the 2 m level. What if using the boundary-layer mean or 950 hPa. The paper should discuss about this sensitivity.

Line 240&#x2013;243: I am confused about why the direct CO\(_2\) effect increases over-prediction. The direct CO\(_2\) warms the tropospheric temperature but has little effect on the surface temperature. It indicates that direct CO\(_2\) effect will reduce the over-prediction. I then look at Fig. S2. It shows that while the near-surface temperature only warms by \(\approx0.1\) C, the upper tropospheric temperature following the moist adiabat warms by \(0.5\) C. This amplification (5 times) is much larger than the 2.5 times amplification in other cases (Fig. S1). Why the moist adiabatic amplification is so different?

\textbf{The direct CO\(_2\) effect leads to a 0.5\% and 0.6\% increase in 2 m relative humidity (RH) for amipF/4K and aqua4K experiments, respectively. This increase in RH leads to a lower lifted condensation level (LCL) in the warmer climate. A lower LCL with warming corresponds to enhanced tropospheric warming as predicted by the moist adiabat as the parcel begins to release latent heat at a lower altitude where there the saturation vapor pressure is higher. When RH is held fixed at the control climate value, tropospheric warming weakens (Fig.~cite:fig:fixed-rh) and the 2.5\(\times\) amplification at 300 hPa is comparable to the other cases. Whereas the small change in RH plays a secondary role for the temperature response to significant near-surface warming, it plays an important role for the temperature response to the direct CO\(_2\) effect where the near-surface warming is small.}

A moist adiabatic prediction where the 2 m RH is held fixed at the control climate value is also shown (dashed orange).")

Line 155: I am not sure if the zero-buoyancy bulk-plume model is sufficient or accurate enough to explain the temperature deviation in models. By assuming a bulk-plume with constant entrainment rate, the model does not predict the right vertical profile of the temperature deviation from the moist adiabat (see Fig. 2 of <sup id="096825b0012543e190587d46bc2d8f9a"><a href="#zhou_conceptual_2019" title="Zhou \&amp; Xie, A {{Conceptual Spectral Plume Model}} for {{Understanding Tropical Temperature Profile}} and {{Convective Updraft Velocities}}, {Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences}, v(9), 2801--2814 (2019).">zhou_conceptual_2019</a></sup> for details). In particular, it predicts largest temperature deviation from the moist adiabat in the tropopause, while in reality the tropopause temperature is close to the moist adiabat (that is, overprediction should be nearly zero in the tropopause). It makes more sense to understand the GCM results using the spectral-plume model, as in <sup id="096825b0012543e190587d46bc2d8f9a"><a href="#zhou_conceptual_2019" title="Zhou \&amp; Xie, A {{Conceptual Spectral Plume Model}} for {{Understanding Tropical Temperature Profile}} and {{Convective Updraft Velocities}}, {Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences}, v(9), 2801--2814 (2019).">zhou_conceptual_2019</a></sup>.

\textbf{We agree that the spectral-plume model of} <sup id="096825b0012543e190587d46bc2d8f9a"><a href="#zhou_conceptual_2019" title="Zhou \&amp; Xie, A {{Conceptual Spectral Plume Model}} for {{Understanding Tropical Temperature Profile}} and {{Convective Updraft Velocities}}, {Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences}, v(9), 2801--2814 (2019).">zhou_conceptual_2019</a></sup> \textbf{(abbreviated as ZX19) better represents the temperature profile near the tropopause compared to the bulk-plume models of SO13, R14, and R16. We added the predictions of the ZX19 model with the vertical profile of entrainment set to the power of} \(k=0.5\) \textbf{to best fit the GFDLrce results (Line insert line number, Fig. 4c,d, Fig. S insert new supplementary figure number here). We find that ZX19 exhibits a similar sensitivity of overprediction to entrainment compared to the bulk-plume models of SO13 and R14. Our interpretation of this is that the pressure level we evaluate the overprediction (300 hPa) is sufficiently below the tropopause that the bulk-plume models are also accurate for predicting the temperature response in RCE.}

Line 142: How is the convective entrainment quantified at each level?

\textbf{We use convective entrainment that is output directly by the RAS scheme. This output is already reported in 1/m at the standard output pressure levels for the GFDL model. We rephrased "quantify" to "record" to better reflect this procedure.}

Line 243: Will it be better to put Fig. 3 together with Fig. 1a,b to better illustrate the changes.
