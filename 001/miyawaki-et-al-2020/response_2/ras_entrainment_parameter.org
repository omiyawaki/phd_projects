I previously mentioned that the RAS scheme outputs the fractional entrainment rate of a plume that detrains at the output level, implying that it is equivalent to \(\epsilon[z_d]\) in ZX19. I take this back as the output from RAS is not \(\epsilon[z_d]\), but rather \(\lambda\) as defined in Equation (1) of cite:moorthi1992, which I repeat here:
#+NAME: eq:ms92
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \eta_{\lambda}}{\partial z} = \lambda,
\end{equation}
where \(\eta_\lambda\) is the normalized mass flux (relative to the cloud base mass flux \(M(z_b)\)) of a plume characterized by the entrainment /parameter/ \(\lambda\). In comparison, \(\epsilon[z_d]\) is related to the mass flux as
#+NAME: eq:zx19
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{M[z_d]}\frac{\partial M[z_d]}{\partial z} = \epsilon[z_d] \quad \mathrm{for} \quad z<z_d,
\end{equation}
where \(M[z_d]\) is the mass flux of a plume that detrains at \(z_d\). If we rewrite Equation ([[eq:ms92]]) using \(M\),
#+NAME: eq:ms92-2
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{M(z_b)}\frac{\partial M}{\partial z} = \lambda,
\end{equation}
and multiply by \(M/M\),
#+NAME: eq:ms92-3
\begin{equation}
\frac{M}{M(z_b)}\frac{1}{M}\frac{\partial M}{\partial z} = \lambda,
\end{equation}
we can substitute Equation ([[eq:zx19]]) into Equation ([[eq:ms92-3]]) to express the relationship between \(\epsilon[z_d]\) and \(\lambda\):
\begin{equation}
\eta\epsilon[z_d] = \lambda.
\end{equation}
Thus, to make a fair comparison between the direct output of entrainment from RAS (\(\lambda\)) to the entrainment rate in ZX19 (\(\epsilon[z_d]\)), I have to compute \(\lambda/\eta\).
