  abstract = {There is significant interest in whether there could be a bifurcation, sometimes referred to as a ``tipping point,'' associated with Arctic sea ice loss. A low-order model of Arctic sea ice has recently been proposed and used to argue that a bifurcation associated with summer sea ice loss (the transition from perennial to seasonal ice) is unlikely. Here bifurcations are investigated in a variation of this model that incorporates additional effects, including parameterizations of changes in clouds and heat transport as sea ice is lost. It is shown that bifurcations can separate perennially and seasonally ice-covered states in this model in a robust parameter regime, although smooth loss of summer sea ice is also possible. Hysteresis and jumps associated with bifurcations involving winter sea ice loss are larger than those associated with summer sea ice loss. Finally, in analogy with simulations in global climate models, the low-order model is integrated with time-varying greenhouse gas forcing in both the regime in which summer sea ice is lost via bifurcations and the regime in which it is not. The resulting time series are compared as a preliminary way of investigating ways in which these regimes could be distinguished from each other.},

  abstract = {Abstract Winter sea ice dramatically cools the Arctic climate during the coldest months of the year and may have remote effects on global climate as well. Accurate forecasting of winter sea ice has significant social and economic benefits. Such forecasting requires the identification and understanding of all of the feedbacks that can affect sea ice. A convective cloud feedback has recently been proposed in the context of explaining equable climates, for example, the climate of the Eocene, which might be important for determining future winter sea ice. In this feedback, CO2-initiated warming leads to sea ice reduction, which allows increased heat and moisture fluxes from the ocean surface, which in turn destabilizes the atmosphere and leads to atmospheric convection. This atmospheric convection produces optically thick convective clouds and increases high-altitude moisture levels, both of which trap outgoing longwave radiation and therefore result in further warming and sea ice loss. Here it is shown that this convective cloud feedback is active at high CO2 during polar night in the coupled ocean\textendash sea ice\textendash land\textendash atmosphere global climate models used for the 1\% yr-1 CO2 increase to the quadrupling (1120 ppm) scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report. At quadrupled CO2, model forecasts of maximum seasonal (March) sea ice volume are found to be correlated with polar winter cloud radiative forcing, which the convective cloud feedback increases. In contrast, sea ice volume is entirely uncorrelated with model global climate sensitivity. It is then shown that the convective cloud feedback plays an essential role in the elimination of March sea ice at quadrupled CO2 in NCAR's Community Climate System Model (CCSM), one of the IPCC models that loses sea ice year-round at this CO2 concentration. A new method is developed to disable the convective cloud feedback in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), the atmospheric component of CCSM, and to show that March sea ice cannot be eliminated in CCSM at CO2 = 1120 ppm without the aide of the convective cloud feedback.},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous work has shown that a convective cloud feedback can greatly increase high-latitude surface temperature upon the removal of sea ice and can keep sea ice from forming throughout polar night. This feedback activates at increased greenhouse gas concentrations. It may help to explain the warm ``equable climates'' of the late Cretaceous and early Paleogene eras ({$\sim$}100 to {$\sim$}35 million years ago) and may be relevant for future climate under global warming. Here, the factors that determine the critical threshold CO2 concentration at which this feedback is active and the magnitude of the warming caused by the feedback are analyzed using both a highly idealized model and NCAR's single-column atmospheric model (SCAM) run under Arctic-like conditions. The critical CO2 is particularly important because it helps to establish the relevance of the feedback for past and future climates. Both models agree that increased heat flux into the high latitudes at low altitudes generally decreases the critical CO2. Increases in oceanic heat transport and in solar radiation absorbed during the summer should cause a sharp decrease in the critical CO2, but the effect of increases in atmospheric heat transport depends on its vertical distribution. It is furthermore found (i) that if the onset of convection produces more clouds and moisture, the critical CO2 should decrease, and the maximum temperature increase caused by the convective cloud feedback should increase and (ii) that reducing the depth of convection reduces the critical CO2 but has little effect on the maximum temperature increase caused by the convective cloud feedback. These results should help with interpretation of the strength and onset of the convective cloud feedback as found, for example, in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere models with different cloud and convection schemes.},

The model contains simplified parametrizations for convection, precipitation, and clouds, and a long-wave radiation scheme that explicitly depends on carbon dioxide, water vapour, and cloud fraction. The convective cloud feedback occurs if the extratropical surface temperature is increased enough to initiate strong atmospheric convection. This results in a change from low to high clouds and from negative to neutral or positive cloud radiative forcing, which further warms the surface and leads to more convection. This positive feedback activates as the CO2 concentration is increased and leads to a climate solution with high boundary-layer temperatures, convection at mid and high latitudes, and an Equator to Pole temperature difference that is reduced by 8\textendash 10 \textdegree C. The reduction in Equator to Pole temperature difference is due to changes in high-latitude local heat balance and occurs despite decreased meridional heat transport. The convective cloud feedback also leads to multiple equilibria and hysteresis with respect to CO2 and other model variables, although these results may be due to the simplicity of the model. The possible connection of the behaviour of the model at high CO2 with equable climates is considered. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2008 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {Geological and geochemical evidence can be interpreted as indicating strong hysteresis in global climate during the Neoproterozoic glacial events ({$\sim$}630 Ma and {$\sim$}715 Ma). Standard climate theory only allows such strong hysteresis if global climate enters a fully-glaciated ``Snowball'' state. However, the survival of photosynthetic, eukaryotic, marine species through these glaciations may indicate that there were large areas of open ocean. A previously-proposed ``Slushball'' model for Neoproterozoic glaciations could easily explain the survival of these organisms because it has open ocean throughout the tropics, but there is only a small amount of hysteresis associated with the Slushball state. In this paper a new state of global climate, the ``Jormungand'' state, is proposed. In this state the ocean is very nearly globally ice-covered, but a very small strip of the tropical ocean remains ice-free. The low ice latitude of the Jormungand state is a consequence of the low albedo of snow-free (bare) sea ice. If the ice latitude propagates into the subtropical desert zone, it can stabilize without collapsing to the equator because subtropical ice-covered regions have a relatively low top-of-atmosphere albedo as a result of the exposure of bare sea ice and relatively lower cloud cover. Moreover, there is strong hysteresis associated with the Jormungand state as greenhouse gas levels are varied because of the high albedo contrast between regions of bare and snow covered sea ice. The Jormungand state is illustrated here in two different atmospheric global climate models and in the Budyko-Sellers model. By offering a scenario that could explain both strong hysteresis in global climate and the survival of life, the Jormungand state represents a potential model for Neoproterozoic glaciations, although further study of this issue is needed.},

Here we argue that over the lifetime of a Snowball event, ice dynamics should lead to the development of a layer of continental and volcanic dust at the ice surface in the tropics that would significantly lower the tropical surface albedo and encourage deglaciation. This idea leads to the prediction that clay drapes found on top of Neoproterozoic glaciations should be thicker in tropical than extratropical regions. We test this idea by running the FOAM general circulation model (GCM) with an added tropical dust layer of different sizes and albedos and find that the tropical dust layer causes Snowball deglaciation at pCO2 = 0.01\textendash 0.1 bar in a reasonable regime of these parameters. We find similar, though more nuanced, results from a limited number of test cases using National Center for Atmospheric Research's CAM GCM.},

These processes strongly affect Snowball Earth deglaciation and the ability of oases to support photosynthetic marine life throughout a Snowball Earth. Here we establish robust aspects of the Snowball Earth atmospheric circulation by running six general circulation models with consistent Snowball Earth boundary conditions. The models produce qualitatively similar patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation minus evaporation. The strength of the Snowball Hadley circulation is roughly double modern at low CO2 and greatly increases as CO2 is increased. We force a 1-D axisymmetric sea glacier model with general circulation model (GCM) output and show that, neglecting zonal asymmetry, sea glaciers would limit ice thickness variations to (10\%). Global mean ice thickness in the 1-D sea glacier model is well-approximated by a 0-D ice thickness model with global mean surface temperature as the upper boundary condition. We then show that a thin-ice Snowball solution is possible in the axysymmetric sea glacier model when forced by output from all the GCMs if we use ice optical properties that favor the thin-ice solution. Finally, we examine Snowball oases for life using analytical models forced by the GCM output and find that conditions become more favorable for oases as the Snowball warms, so that the most critical time for the survival of life would be near the beginning of a Snowball Earth episode.},

Past work has linked such invigoration with the latent heat released by water condensation or freezing in chains of processes that depend on aerosol concentrations. Abbott and Cronin suggest a third possibility in which updrafts intensify because high aerosol concentrations increase environmental humidity by mixing more condensed water into the surrounding air, which in turn favors stronger updrafts. Science, this issue p. 83 Cloud-aerosol interactions remain a major obstacle to understanding climate and severe weather. Observations suggest that aerosols enhance tropical thunderstorm activity; past research, motivated by the importance of understanding aerosol impacts on clouds, has proposed several mechanisms that could explain that observed link. We find that high-resolution atmospheric simulations can reproduce the observed link between aerosols and convection. However, we also show that previously proposed mechanisms are unable to explain the invigoration. Examining underlying processes reveals that, in our simulations, high aerosol concentrations increase environmental humidity by producing clouds that mix more condensed water into the surrounding air. In turn, higher humidity favors large-scale ascent and stronger convection. Our results provide a physical reason to expect invigorated thunderstorms in high-aerosol regions of the tropics. Computer simulations show that aerosols increase updraft speeds in clouds by increasing humidity outside clouds.

This uncertainty is addressed here by analyzing idealized convection-permitting simulations of radiative\textendash convective equilibrium in long-channel geometry. Across a wide range of climates, the thermodynamic contribution to changes in instantaneous precipitation extremes follows near-surface moisture, and the dynamic contribution is positive and small but is sensitive to domain size. The shapes of mass flux profiles associated with precipitation extremes are determined by conditional sampling that favors strong vertical motion at levels where the vertical saturation specific humidity gradient is large, and mass flux profiles collapse to a common shape across climates when plotted in a moisture-based vertical coordinate. The collapse, robust to changes in microphysics and turbulence schemes, implies a thermodynamic contribution that scales with near-surface moisture despite substantial convergence aloft and allows the dynamic contribution to be defined by the pressure velocity at a single level. Linking the simplified dynamic mode to vertical velocities from entraining plume models reveals that the small dynamic mode in channel simulations ({$<$}inline-formula xmlns:ifp="http://www.ifactory.com/press"{$><$}math{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal"{$>\lessequivlnt<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$}2\% K\textsuperscript{-1}) is caused by opposing height dependences of vertical velocity and density, together with the buffering influence of cloud-base buoyancies that vary little with surface temperature.

  abstract = {The ocean's thermal inertia is a major contributor to irreversible ocean changes exceeding time scales that matter to human society. This fact is a challenge to societies as they prepare for the consequences of climate change, especially with respect to the ocean. Here we review the requirements for human actions from the ocean's perspective. In the near term ({$\sim$}2030), goals such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be critical. Over longer times ({$\sim$}2050-2060 and beyond), global carbon neutrality targets may be met as countries continue to work toward reducing emissions. Both adaptation and mitigation plans need to be fully implemented in the interim, and the Global Ocean Observation System should be sustained so that changes can be continuously monitored. In the longer-term (after {$\sim$}2060), slow emerging changes such as deep ocean warming and sea level rise are committed to continue even in the scenario where net zero emissions are reached. Thus, climate actions have to extend to time scales of hundreds of years. At these time scales, preparation for ``high impact, low probability'' risks - such as an abrupt showdown of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, ecosystem change, or irreversible ice sheet loss - should be fully integrated into long-term planning. 摘要 在全球变化背景下, 海洋的很多变化在人类社会发展的时间尺度上 (百年至千年) 具有不可逆转性, 海洋巨大的热惯性是造成该不可逆性的主要原因.这个特征为人类和生态系统应对海洋变化提出一系列挑战.本文从海洋变化的角度总结了人类应对气候变化的要求, 提出需要进行多时间尺度的规划和统筹.在近期 (到2030年) , 实现联合国可持续发展目标至关重要.在中期 (2050\textendash 2060年前后) , 全球需要逐步减排并实现碳中和目标.同时, 适应和减缓气候变化的行动和措施必须同步施行;全球海洋观测系统需要得以维持并完善以持续监测海洋变化.在远期 (在2060年之后) , 即使全球达到净零排放, 包括深海变暖和海平面上升在内的海洋变化都将持续, 因此应对全球变化的行动需持续数百年之久.在该时间尺度, 应对``低概率, 高影响''气候风险 (即发生的可能性较低, 但一旦发生影响极大的事件带来的风险, 例如:大西洋经圈反转环流突然减弱,海洋生态系统跨过临界点,无可挽回的冰盖质量损失等) 的准备应充分纳入长期规划.},

Changes in mean temperatures are part of any global warming signal, whereas changes in temperature gradients are primarily associated with ENSO. Within this study, 6 reanalysis datasets, 22 Atmospheric Modeling Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations, and 11 historical simulations from phase 5 of the Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are analyzed, covering the years 1979\textendash 2012. It is found that the HC widens as mean temperatures increase or as temperature gradients weaken in most reanalyses and climate models. On average, climate models exhibit a smaller sensitivity of HC width to changes in mean temperatures and temperature gradients than do reanalyses. However, the sensitivities differ substantially among reanalyses, rendering the HC response to mean temperatures in climate models not statistically different from that in reanalyses.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}While global-mean temperatures did not increase substantially between 1997 and 2012, the HC continued to widen in most reanalyses.

In the maritime tropics, CAPE and precipitation are usually inversely correlated. In continental convection (i.e., midlatitude and tropical), no consistent relationship has been found. In this study of the semiarid Southwest, a moderate positive correlation exists, approaching 0.6. Correlations based on radiosonde data are found to be sensitive to the parcel level of origin. The strongest correlations are found by modifying the preconvective morning sounding with the maximum reported surface temperature, assuming well-mixed adiabatic layers to the level of free convection with pseudoadiabatic ascent. These results show that the upper bounds on parcel instability correlate best with precipitation. Furthermore, the CAPE\textendash precipitation relationship is argued to depend on the convective regime being considered. The North American monsoon convective regime requires essentially only moisture advection interacting with the strong surface sensible heating over complex topography. Elimination of strong convective inhibition through intense surface sensible heating in the presence of sufficient water vapor leads to the positive CAPE\textendash precipitation relationship on diurnal time scales. These results are discussed in light of contradictory results from other continental and maritime regions, which demonstrate negative correlations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This latter observation makes it possible to relate the ITCZ position to the energy balance, specifically the atmospheric net energy input near the equator and the cross-equatorial energy flux. Here the validity of the resulting relations between the ITCZ position and energetic quantities is examined with reanalysis data for the years 1979\textendash 2014. In the reanalysis data, the EFE and ITCZ position indeed covary on time scales of seasons and longer. Consistent with theory, the ITCZ position is proportional to the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy flux and inversely proportional to atmospheric net energy input at the equator. Variations of the cross-equatorial energy flux dominate seasonal variations of the ITCZ position. By contrast, variations of the equatorial net energy input, driven by ocean energy uptake variations, dominate interannual variations of the ITCZ position (e.g., those associated with ENSO).{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Near the ITCZ, column-integrated energy fluxes vanish, forming an atmospheric energy flux equator (EFE). This paper extends existing approximations relating the ITCZ position and EFE to the atmospheric energy budget by allowing for zonal variations. The resulting relations are tested using reanalysis data for 1979\textendash 2014. The zonally varying EFE is found as the latitude where the meridional component of the divergent atmospheric energy transport (AET) vanishes. A Taylor expansion of the AET around the equator relates the ITCZ position to derivatives of the AET. To a first order, the ITCZ position is proportional to the divergent AET across the equator; it is inversely proportional to the local atmospheric net energy input (NEI) that consists of the net energy fluxes at the surface, at the top of the atmosphere, and zonally across longitudes. The first-order approximation captures the seasonal migrations of the ITCZ in the African, Asian, and Atlantic sectors. In the eastern Pacific, a third-order approximation captures the bifurcation from single- to double-ITCZ states that occurs during boreal spring. In contrast to linear EFE theory, during boreal winter in the eastern Pacific, northward cross-equatorial AET goes along with an ITCZ north of the equator. EFE and ITCZ variations driven by ENSO are characterized by an equatorward (poleward) shift in the Pacific during El Ni\~no (La Ni\~na) episodes, which are associated with variations in equatorial ocean energy uptake.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Applying the conservation of energy principle to the incoming solar radiation and to the long-wave radiation, a heating mechanism of the atmosphere is introduced. A simplified emission spectrum of the atmosphere with one transparent region is used. The surface of the earth and a cloud layer are considered as black bodies.A simplified model of the atmosphere containing the coupling between dynamical and thermodynamical processes is presented. The equations that give the temperature, the excess of radiation and the mean zonal wind for each day of the year are derived. The temperature is given by a second order differential equation that can readily be solved. The zonal wind and the excess of radiation are explicit functions of the temperature.If in the computations we postulate that the addition of energy by processes other than radiation is a constant, the solution agrees remarkably well with the observed values, except in the months of May, June and July.It is shown that using only meridional turbulent diffusion transport of heat by large eddies, the required transport is accomplished. The theoretical solution requires a transport with the following exchange coefficients: 5 \texttimes{} 1010 cm2 per sec in February and in March, 4.5 \texttimes{} 1010 in October, 4 \texttimes{} 1010 in January, 3.5 \texttimes{} 1010 in November, 3 \texttimes{} 1010 in September and in December, 2 \texttimes{} 1010 in April, 0.25 \texttimes{} 1010 in August, and zero in May, June and July. There are two maxima of the value of the exchange coefficient: one in February and the other in October. The order of magnitude of the values of the exchange coefficient of our solution is in complete agreement with the value corresponding to the migratory cyclones and anticyclones of the middle latitudes, treated as turbulent eddies, which is equal to 5 \texttimes{} 1010.The theoretical solution correctly gives the position and strength of the jet stream, except in May, June and July. Therefore we can conclude that, except in these months, the mean daily circulation is mainly a result of the transfer of energy by radiation processes and the turbulent meridional transport of heat by the migratory cyclones and anticyclones.},

The approach harnesses a recent development called multi-fractal temporally weighted detrended fluctuation analysis, which exploits the intuition that points closer in time are more likely to be related than distant points. In both datasets, we extract multiple crossover times, as characterized by generalized Hurst exponents, ranging from synoptic to decadal. The method goes beyond treatments that assume a single decay scale process, such as a first-order autoregression, which cannot be justifiably fitted to these observations. Importantly, the strength of the seasonal cycle `masks' long-term correlations on time scales beyond seasonal. When removing the seasonal cycle from the original record, the ice extent data exhibit white noise behaviour from seasonal to bi-seasonal time scales, whereas the clear fingerprints of the short (weather) and long (approx. 7 and 9 year) time scales remain, the latter associated with the recent decay in the ice cover. Therefore, long-term persistence is re-entrant beyond the seasonal scale and it is not possible to distinguish whether a given ice extent minimum/maximum will be followed by a minimum/maximum that is larger or smaller in magnitude.},

Most of RCMs show an increase of cyclone frequency in winter (DJF) and a decrease in summer (JJA) to the end of the 21st century. However, in one half of the RCMs, cyclones become weaker and substantially smaller in winter and deeper and larger in summer. RCMs as well as GCMs show an increase of cyclone frequency over the Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, north of Greenland, Canadian Archipelago, and a decrease over the Nordic Seas, Kara and Beaufort Seas and over the sub-arctic continental regions in winter. In summer, the models simulate an increase of cyclone frequency over the Central Arctic and Greenland Sea and a decrease over the Norwegian and Kara Seas by the end of the 21st century. The decrease is also found over the high-latitude continental areas, in particular, over east Siberia and Alaska.

Its thermodynamic variability has long been characterized using simple frameworks, of which mixed layer theory is the simplest kind. Past studies qualitatively support such a description, yet the adequacy of mixed layer theory as a quantitative description has not been tested. Here we use observations collected during the EUREC4A (Elucidating the role of clouds\textendash circulation coupling in climate) field campaign to test this framework and evaluate our understanding of the trade-wind subcloud layer. We find evidence for a transition layer separating the mixed layer and subcloud layer tops. The presence of such a finitely-thick transition layer with vertical gradients complicates the application of mixed layer theory, which assumes an abrupt gradient, or `jump' at the subcloud layer top. This ambiguity introduces effective parameters and motivates their estimation through a Bayesian methodology. Results from this Bayesian inversion further reflect a finite-depth entrainment zone. We find that subcloud layer moisture and heat budgets close for synoptic variability and a monthly campaign-mean, yielding a campaign-mean residual of 3.6 Wm-2 for moisture and 2.9 Wm-2 for heat. Surface wind speed variability influences the subcloud layer depth and fluxes, yet thermodynamic variability above the subcloud layer top emerges as the primary control on subcloud layer moisture and heat variability. Given that this simple theoretical framework can explain observed variability, it offers an appealing framework for evaluating larger-scale models that must parameterize the processes regulating this fundamental part of the atmosphere.},

A physical mechanism responsible for this pattern is presented and tested in an energy balance model and two different GCMs through a series of fixed-SST and ``ghost forcing'' experiments. In the first ghost forcing experiment, 4~W/m2 is added uniformly to the mixed layer heat budget and in the second and third, the same forcing is confined to the tropics and extra-tropics, respectively. The result of the uniform forcing is a polar amplified response much like that resulting from a doubling of CO2. Due to an observed linearity this response can be interpreted as the sum of the essentially uniform response to the tropical-only forcing and a more localized response to the extra-tropical-only forcing. The flat response to the tropical forcing comes about due to increased meridional heat transports leading to a warming and moistening of the high-latitude atmosphere. This produces a longwave forcing on the high-latitude surface budget which also has been observed by other investigators. Moreover, the tropical surface budget is found to be more sensitive to SST changes than the extra-tropical surface budget. This strengthens the tendency for the above mechanism to produce polar amplification, since the tropics need to warm less to counter an imposed forcing.},

Our analysis demonstrates large discrepancies between the reanalysis datasets, possibly due to differences in the data assimilation procedures as well as sparseness and inhomogeneity of high-latitude observations. We test the robustness of arctic tropospheric warming based on the ERA-40 dataset. ERA-40 Arctic atmosphere temperatures tend to be closer to the observed ones in terms of root mean square error compared to other reanalysis products used in the article. However, changes in the ERA-40 data assimilation procedure produce unphysical jumps in atmospheric temperatures, which may be the likely reason for the elevated tropospheric warming trend in 1979\textendash 2002. NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data show that the near-surface upward temperature trend over the same period is greater than the tropospheric trend, which is consistent with direct radiosonde observations and inconsistent with ERA-40 results. A change of sign in the winter temperature trend from negative to positive in the late 1980s is documented in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere with a maximum over the Canadian Arctic, based on radiosonde data. This change from cooling to warming tendency is associated with weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex and shift of its center toward the Siberian coast and possibly can be explained by the changes in the dynamics of the Arctic Oscillation. This temporal pattern is consistent with multi-decadal variations of key arctic climate parameters like, for example, surface air temperature and oceanic freshwater content. Elucidating the mechanisms behind these changes will be critical to understanding the complex nature of high-latitude variability and its impact on global climate change.},

While a typical cloudy state of the Arctic winter boundary layer has been linked to the advection of moist air masses, direct observations of the transformation from moist midlatitude to dry Arctic air are lacking. Here, we have used observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project to compile Eulerian observations along the trajectories of warm and cold air masses in a Lagrangian sense, showing the cooling and drying of air masses over sea ice and moistening over the open ocean. Air masses originating mostly over open water generate cloudy conditions over the observation site, whereas air masses originating over continents or sea ice generate radiatively clear conditions. We recommend using our case-studies and the method of linking expeditions to station soundings via back-trajectories for modelling work in future campaigns.},

The short wave radiative effect of cloud is primarily manifest as a reduction in the solar radiation absorbed at the surface of - 53 Wm-2. Clouds impact long wave radiation by heating the moist tropical atmosphere (up to around 40 Wm-2 for global annual means) while enhancing the radiative cooling of the atmosphere over other regions, in particular higher latitudes and sub-tropical marine stratocumulus regimes.

Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

As in previous studies, the diagnosis is based on the equivalent length of a test tracer advected on isentropic surfaces, in this case using the van Leer flux-limiting scheme driven by the United Kingdom Meteorological Office assimilated winds. Although the magnitude of equivalent length is resolution dependent, its structure is shown to be reasonably robust for quantifying the inhomogeneous mixing in the stratosphere. The van Leer calculation agrees well with a more expensive spectral transform calculation at a comparable resolution, suggesting that the diagnostic is not sensitive to the advection scheme or subgrid representation of the models. A first attempt is also made at estimating the implicit numerical diffusion of the van Leer scheme, which is necessary to convert equivalent length to effective diffusivity. Compared with the spectral calculations with a constant diffusion coefficient, the van Leer results show notably greater diffusivity within the winter polar vortices despite the comparable equivalent lengths, suggesting that the scheme may be overdiffusing in the vicinities of mobile tracer extrema. The climatology of equivalent length is then presented, and the seasonal evolution is discussed in detail for the lower, middle, and upper stratosphere. The major mixing barriers (winter and summer polar vortices and tropical eddy transport barrier) are easily identified, as well as the strong mixing regions (surf zones). Generally, equivalent length tends to be small in regions of strong zonal wind and large in regions of weak wind. Large values of equivalent length are observed in the summer lower stratosphere and in the middle stratosphere during the breakup of the polar vortices. Interhemispheric asymmetry is observed both after the winter polar vortex breakup, where in the middle stratosphere the Southern Hemisphere shows much larger equivalent lengths, and in the summer tropical region, where larger equivalent lengths are observed in the Northern Hemisphere, likely related to the monsoon circulation. A monthly averaged equivalent length climatology is presented, and implications for two-dimensional stratospheric chemistry-transport modeling are discussed.},

We derive estimates of temperature trends for the upper troposphere to the lower stratosphere since 1970. Over the period of observations, we find a maximum warming trend of 0.65{$\pm$}0.47\,K per decade near the 200\,hPa pressure level, below the tropical tropopause. Warming patterns are consistent with model predictions except for small discrepancies close to the tropopause. Our findings are inconsistent with the trends derived from radiosonde temperature datasets and from NCEP reanalyses of temperature and wind fields. The agreement with models increases confidence in current model-based predictions of future climate change.},

  abstract = {A special study of the Sharav Cyclones indicates that they are the result of large-scale weak baroclinicity, enhanced by vigorous boundary-layer baroclinicity between the North African coast and the Mediterranean. It is illustrated how the jet stream plays a major role in the vertical circulation in producing a complex cyclonic circulation dominated by at least three mechanisms: large-scale interior baroclinicity, boundary-layer baroclinicity, and jet stream related circulations. The main characteristics of the Sharav Cyclone (also called the Saharan Depression or Khamsin Depression) in the Mediterranean are reviewed. Unlike the cold winter cyclone, the Sharav Cyclone is a spring cyclone. Its tracks lie mainly along the North African coast and turn to the north near the southeastern Mediterranean. Its warm front is active and is sometimes associated with extremely high surface temperatures. Its cold front is shallow. The Sharav Cyclone moves eastward relatively fast, typically faster than 10 m s-1, and with a small speed variability. In general, there is an upper level trough to the west of the surface low and the surface horizontal scale is of the order of 500\textendash 1000 km. Finally, it is frequently associated with heavy dust/sand storms and low visibilities. Some of these features are illustrated in a case study of the April 28\textendash 30, 1986, cyclone. Vertical cross sections indicate a deep circulation associated with the exit region of an upper level jet. In addition to presenting evidence that the Sharav Cyclone is a deep tropospheric circulation, it is shown that the transverse indirect circulation at the exit region of the jet is a major component of its circulation. The classic two-level baroclinic model (Phillips, 1954) is applied. The effects of the major diabatic heating due to the sensible heat flux above the North African desert and the large north to south temperature gradients are incorporated through the thermal wind of the basic state. The model predicts the fast eastward motion, the relatively smaller horizontal scale and the fast growth rate. Furthermore, the model predicts an annual maximum growth rate in April and a secondary peak in October, which agrees with the frequency of occurrences of the Sharav Cyclones.},

In winter, when the polar oceans have extensive ice covers and the water-air temperature difference is typically 20\textdegree\textendash 40\textdegree C, they allow enormous amounts of sensible and latent heat to escaoe from the ocean to the atmosphere. Parameterizing these fluxes accurately is thus an important part of modeling the growth and decay of sea ice.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}To develop a unified method for parameterizing the turbulent transfer from open water surrounded by pack ice, we have reanalyzed data reported in the literature on momentum and heat transfer over Arctic leads and polynyas. The neutral stability value of the 10-m drag coefficient, {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}DN{$<$}/em{$>$}10} = 1.49\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-1}, is independent of wind speed and open-water fetch for winds from 1 to 10 m s\textsuperscript{-1} and fetches from 7 to 500 m. That value is slightly higher than values typical of the open ocean at these wind speed probably because of the form drag over the upwind ice or at the ice edges and because the wave field is still actively growing. We parameterize the neutral stability value of the 10-m transfer coefficient for sensible heat, {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}HN{$<$}/em{$>$}10}, with the nondimensional fetch {$<$}em{$>$}X{$<$}/em{$>$}/{$<$}em{$>$}L{$<$}/em{$>$}, where {$<$}em{$>$}X{$<$}/em{$>$} is the over-water fetch and {$<$}em{$>$}L{$<$}/em{$>$} is the Obukhov length. The {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}HN{$<$}/em{$>$}10} has a maximum value of 1.8 \texttimes{} 10\textsuperscript{-3} at very small -{$<$}em{$>$}X{$<$}/em{$>$}/{$<$}em{$>$}L{$<$}/em{$>$} but decreases rapidly with increasing -{$<$}em{$>$}X{$<$}/em{$>$}/{$<$}em{$>$}L{$<$}/em{$>$} to 1.0\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{-3} -essentially the open ocean value. We find no compelling reason to believe that the bulk transfer coefficient for latent heat is different from {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}HN{$<$}/em{$>$}10}. The approach of {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}HN{$<$}/em{$>$}10} to its open ocean value at relatively short fetches (roughly 200 m) implies that horizontal homogeneity may not be as severe a constraint for evaluating scalar transfer coefficients as it is for some other applications of the flux-gradient relations.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The bulk transfer coeficients actually used in modeling turbulent transfer over leads and polynyas are derivable from our reported {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}DN{$<$}/em{$>$}10} and {$<$}em{$>$}C{$<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}HN{$<$}/em{$>$}10} values if the atmospheric stability is known.

Often, multiple humidity sensors even showed supersaturation. Four months of observations over sea ice in the Antarctic showed the same behavior. These frequent, ubiquitous, and reproducible measurements are too compelling to discount. We hypothesize that the high relative humidity is a consequence of plentiful water vapor given up by leads and polynyas. We thus develop a simple time-dependent vapor budget model that we solve analytically to assess the role of leads in supplying water vapor to the polar atmospheric boundary layer. The solution to that model shows that (1) because the polar marine boundary layer is generally thin, its timescale for reaching moisture equilibrium is much shorter than the timescale of the synoptic processes that tend to disrupt equilibrium, and (2) because they have relatively warm surfaces, open leads and polynyas supply water vapor more rapidly than the surrounding sea ice surface can remove it, despite an open water fractional area that may be only 5\%. In concert, the two processes commonly lead to water vapor densities in the boundary layer over sea ice that are near the value for ice saturation.},

  abstract = {The surface of the Arctic Ocean in summer is a mix of sea ice and water in both leads and melt ponds. Here we use data collected at multiple sites during the year-long experiment to study the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) to develop a bulk turbulent flux algorithm for predicting the surface fluxes of momentum and sensible and latent heat over the Arctic Ocean during summer from readily measured or modelled quantities. The distinctive aerodynamic feature of summer sea ice is that the leads and melt ponds create vertical ice faces that the wind can push against; momentum transfer to the surface is thus enhanced through form drag. In effect, summer sea ice behaves aerodynamically like the marginal ice zone, which is another surface that consists of sea ice and water. In our bulk flux algorithm, we therefore combine our SHEBA measurements of the neutral-stability drag coefficient at a reference height of 10 m, \$\textbackslash hboxC\_\textbackslash rm DN10\$, with similar measurements from marginal ice zones that have been reported in the literature to create a unified parametrization for \$\textbackslash hboxC\_\textbackslash rm DN10\$ for summer sea ice and for any marginal ice zone.

The AGCMs therefore have a similar temperature pattern and trend to that of observed historical climate change. The AGCMs simulate a spread in climate feedback similar to that seen in coupled simulations of the response to CO2 quadrupling.

This is due to a pattern effect, whereby the pattern of observed historical sea surface temperature change gives rise to more negative cloud and longwave clear-sky feedbacks. Assuming the patterns of long-term temperature change simulated by models, and the radiative response to them, are credible; this implies that existing constraints on EffCS from historical energy budget variations give values that are too low and overly constrained, particularly at the upper end.

Cloud and lapse rate feedbacks are found to vary the most, depending strongly on the pattern of tropical Pacific SST change. When warming is focused in the southeast tropical Pacific\textemdash a region of climatological subsidence and extensive marine low cloud cover\textemdash warming reduces the lower-tropospheric stability (LTS) and low cloud cover but is largely trapped under an inversion and hence has little remote effect. The net result is a relatively weak negative lapse rate feedback and a large positive cloud feedback. In contrast, when warming is weak in the southeast tropical Pacific and enhanced in the west tropical Pacific\textemdash a strong convective region\textemdash warming is efficiently transported throughout the free troposphere. The increased atmospheric stability results in a strong negative lapse rate feedback and increases the LTS in low cloud regions, resulting in a low cloud feedback of weak magnitude. These mechanisms help explain why climate feedback and sensitivity change on multidecadal time scales in AOGCM abrupt4xCO\textsubscript{2} simulations and are different from those seen in AGCM experiments forced with observed historical SST changes. From the physical understanding developed here, one should expect unusually negative radiative feedbacks and low effective climate sensitivities to be diagnosed from real-world variations in radiative fluxes and temperature over decades in which the eastern Pacific has lacked warming.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Experiments with CO2 instantaneously quadrupled and then held constant are used to show that the relationship between the global-mean net heat input to the climate system and the global-mean surface air temperature change is nonlinear in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) atmosphere\textendash ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). The nonlinearity is shown to arise from a change in strength of climate feedbacks driven by an evolving pattern of surface warming. In 23 out of the 27 AOGCMs examined, the climate feedback parameter becomes significantly (95\% confidence) less negative (i.e., the effective climate sensitivity increases) as time passes. Cloud feedback parameters show the largest changes. In the AOGCM mean, approximately 60\% of the change in feedback parameter comes from the tropics (30\textdegree N\textendash 30\textdegree S). An important region involved is the tropical Pacific, where the surface warming intensifies in the east after a few decades. The dependence of climate feedbacks on an evolving pattern of surface warming is confirmed using the HadGEM2 and HadCM3 atmosphere GCMs (AGCMs). With monthly evolving sea surface temperatures and sea ice prescribed from its AOGCM counterpart, each AGCM reproduces the time-varying feedbacks, but when a fixed pattern of warming is prescribed the radiative response is linear with global temperature change or nearly so. It is also demonstrated that the regression and fixed-SST methods for evaluating effective radiative forcing are in principle different, because rapid SST adjustment when CO2 is changed can produce a pattern of surface temperature change with zero global mean but nonzero change in net radiation at the top of the atmosphere (\textasciitilde -0.5 W m-2 in HadCM3).},

The effective climate sensitivity (EffCS) to a doubling of CO2 is 5.5 K for HadGEM3.1-GC3.1-LL and 5.4 K for UKESM1. The transient climate response is 2.5 and 2.8 K, respectively. While the EffCS is larger than that seen in the previous generation of models, none of the model's forcing or feedback processes are found to be atypical of models, though the cloud feedback is at the high end. The relatively large EffCS results from an unusual combination of a typical CO2 forcing with a relatively small feedback parameter. Compared to the previous U.K. climate model, HadGEM3-GC2.0, the EffCS has increased from 3.2 to 5.5 K due to an increase in CO2 forcing, surface albedo feedback, and midlatitude cloud feedback. All changes are well understood and due to physical improvements in the model. At higher atmospheric and ocean resolution (HadGEM3-GC3.1-MM), there is a compensation between increased marine stratocumulus cloud feedback and reduced Antarctic sea-ice feedback. In UKESM1, a CO2 fertilization effect induces a land surface vegetation change and albedo radiative effect. Historical aerosol forcing in HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL is -1.1 W m-2. In HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL historical simulations, cloud feedback is found to be less positive than in abrupt-4xCO2, in agreement with atmosphere-only experiments forced with observed historical sea surface temperature and sea-ice variations. However, variability in the coupled model's historical sea-ice trends hampers accurate diagnosis of the model's total historical feedback.},

Wave transience, forcing and dissipation are taken into account in a very general way. The theory makes it possible to discuss the latitudinal (y) and vertical (z) dependence of {$\partial$}\=u/{$\partial$}t qualitatively and calculate it directly from an approximate knowledge of the wave structure. For equatorial modes it reveals that the y profile of {$\partial$}\=u/{$\partial$}t is strongly dependent on the nature of the forcing or dissipation mechanism. A by-product of the theory is a far-reaching generalization of the theorems of Charney-Drazin, Dickinson and Holton on the forcing of {$\partial$}\=u/{$\partial$}t by conservative linear waves. Implications for the quasi-biennial oscillation in the equatorial stratosphere are discussed. Graphs of y profiles of {$\partial$}\=u/{$\partial$}t are given for the equatorial waves considered in the recent analysis of observational data by Lindzen and Tsay (1975). The y profile of {$\partial$}\=u/{$\partial$}t for Rossby-gravity and inertio-gravity modes, in Lindzen and Tsay's parameter ranges, prove extremely sensitive to whether or not small amounts of mechanical dissipation are present alongside the radiative-photochemical dissipation of the waves. The probable importance of low-frequency Rossby waves for the momentum budget of the descending easterlies is suggested.},

Because sea-surface nutrient concentrations are generally high in the high latitudes,pCO2sensitivity to high-latitude forcing also determinespCO2sensitivity to the biological pump globally. We diagnose high-latitude sensitivity of a range of ocean models using atmosphericpCO2above an abiotic ocean; cold high-latitude waters pull abioticpCO2to low values. Box models are very high-latitude sensitive, while most global circulation models are considerably less so, including a two-dimensional overturning model, two primitive equation models, the Hamburg class of large scale geostrophic (LSG) general circulation models (GCMs), and the MICOM isopycnic GCM. High-latitude forcing becomes more important in a depth-coordinate GCM when lateral diffusion is oriented along isopycnal surfaces, rather than horizontally, followingRedi [1982]. In two different GCMs (a primitive equation model and LSG), addition of the Gent and McWillams[1990] isopycnal thickness diffusion scheme had only minor impact on high-latitude sensitivity. Using a simplified box model, we show that high-latitude sensitivity depends on a high-latitude monopoly on deep water formation. In an attempt to bridge the gap between box models and GCMs, we constructed a simple slab overturning model with an imposed stream function which can be discretized at arbitrary resolution from box model to GCM scale. High-latitude sensitivity is independent of model resolution but very sensitive to vertical diffusion. Diffusion acts to break the high-latitude monopoly, decreasing high-latitude sensitivity. In the isopycnal GCM MICOM, however, high-latitude sensitivity is relatively insensitive to diapycnal diffusion of tracers such as CO2. This would imply that flow pathways in MICOM take the place of vertical diffusion in the slab model. The two nominally most sophisticated ocean models in the comparison are the isopycnal model MICOM and the depth-coordinate GCM withRedi [1982] and Gent and McWilliams [1990] mixing. Unfortunately, these two models disagree in their abiotic CO2behavior; the depth-coordinate isopycnal mixing GCM is high-latitude sensitive, in accord with box models, while MICOM is less so. The rest of the GCMs, which have historically seen the most use in geochemical studies, are even less high-latitude sensitive than MICOM. This discrepancy needs to be resolved. In the meantime, the implication of the MICOM/traditional GCM result would be that box models overestimate high-latitude sensitivity of the real ocean. This would eliminate iron dust fertilization of the ocean as an explanation for the glacialpCO2 range of 180\textendash 200 {$\mu$}atm [Archer et al., 2000].},

In the northern hemisphere, the jet stream weakened. In the southern hemisphere, the sub-tropical jet weakened, whereas the polar jet strengthened.

It informs us of the minimum climate change we face and, moreover, depends only on our knowledge of the natural climate system. Studies of the climate commitment due to CO2 find that global temperature would remain near current levels, or even decrease slightly, in the millennium following the cessation of emissions. However, this result overlooks the important role of the non-CO2 greenhouse gases and aerosols. This paper shows that global energetics require an immediate and significant warming following the cessation of emissions as aerosols are quickly washed from the atmosphere, and the large uncertainty in current aerosol radiative forcing implies a large uncertainty in the climate commitment. Fundamental constraints preclude Earth returning to pre-industrial temperatures for the indefinite future. These same constraints mean that observations are currently unable to eliminate the possibility that we are already beyond the point where the ultimate warming will exceed dangerous levels. Models produce a narrower range of climate commitment, but undersample observed forcing constraints.},

The transition to an Arctic that is populated by thinner, first-year sea ice has important implications for future trends in area and volume. Here, a reduced model for Arctic sea ice is developed. This model is used to investigate how the survivability of first-year and multiyear ice controls the mean state, variability, and trends in ice area and volume. A hindcast with a global dynamic\textendash thermodynamic sea ice model that traces first-year and multiyear ice is used to estimate the survivability of each ice type. These estimates of survivability, in concert with the reduced model, yield persistence time scales of September area and volume anomalies and the characteristics of the sensitivity of sea ice to climate forcing that compare well with a fully coupled climate model. The September area is found to be nearly in equilibrium with climate forcing at all times, and therefore the observed decline in summer sea ice cover is a clear indication of a changing climate. Keeping an account of first-year and multiyear ice area within global climate models offers a powerful way to evaluate those models with observations, and could help to constrain projections of sea ice decline in a warming climate.},

It is shown here that the three perspectives provide complementary diagnostics of meridional AHT and its changes under greenhouse gas forcing. When combined, the energetic and diffusive perspectives offer prognostic insights: anomalous AHT is constrained to satisfy the net energetic demands of radiative forcing, radiative feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake; in turn, the meridional pattern of warming must adjust to produce those AHT changes, and does so approximately according to diffusion of anomalous MSE. The relationship between temperature and MSE exerts strong constraints on the warming pattern, favoring polar amplification. These conclusions are supported by use of a diffusive moist energy balance model (EBM) that accurately predicts zonal-mean warming and AHT changes within comprehensive general circulation models (GCMs). A dry diffusive EBM predicts similar AHT changes in order to satisfy the same energetic constraints, but does so through tropically amplified warming\textemdash at odds with the GCMs' polar-amplified warming pattern. The results suggest that polar-amplified warming is a near-inevitable consequence of a moist, diffusive atmosphere's response to greenhouse gas forcing. In this view, atmospheric circulations must act to satisfy net AHT as constrained by energetics.},

We test sea ice reversibility within a state-of-the-art atmosphere\textendash ocean global climate model by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide until the Arctic Ocean becomes ice-free throughout the year and subsequently decreasing it until the initial ice cover returns. Evidence for irreversibility in the form of hysteresis outside the envelope of natural variability is explored for the loss of summer and winter ice in both hemispheres. We find no evidence of irreversibility or multiple ice-cover states over the full range of simulated sea ice conditions between the modern climate and that with an annually ice-free Arctic Ocean. Summer sea ice area recovers as hemispheric temperature cools along a trajectory that is indistinguishable from the trajectory of summer sea ice loss, while the recovery of winter ice area appears to be slowed due to the long response times of the ocean near the modern winter ice edge. The results are discussed in the context of previous studies that assess the plausibility of sea ice tipping points by other methods. The findings serve as evidence against the existence of threshold behavior in the summer or winter ice cover in either hemisphere.},

Further, these processes are primarily due to passive advection of the anomalous warming signal by climatological ocean currents; changes in ocean circulation are secondary. These findings suggest the Southern Ocean responds to greenhouse gas forcing on the centennial, or longer, timescale over which the deep ocean waters that are upwelled to the surface are warmed themselves. It is against this background of gradual warming that multidecadal Southern Ocean temperature trends must be understood.},

While the global climate feedback is often assumed to be constant, its value\textemdash diagnosed from global climate models\textemdash shows substantial time variation under transient warming. Here a reformulation of the global climate feedback in terms of its contributions from regional climate feedbacks is proposed, providing a clear physical insight into this behavior. Using (i) a state-of-the-art global climate model and (ii) a low-order energy balance model, it is shown that the global climate feedback is fundamentally linked to the geographic pattern of regional climate feedbacks and the geographic pattern of surface warming at any given time. Time variation of the global climate feedback arises naturally when the pattern of surface warming evolves, actuating feedbacks of different strengths in different regions. This result has substantial implications for the ability to constrain future climate changes from observations of past and present climate states. The regional climate feedbacks formulation also reveals fundamental biases in a widely used method for diagnosing climate sensitivity, feedbacks, and radiative forcing\textemdash the regression of the global top-of-atmosphere radiation flux on global surface temperature. Further, it suggests a clear mechanism for the ``efficacies'' of both ocean heat uptake and radiative forcing.},

  abstract = {Abstract Persistent superrotation is seen in the atmospheres of other terrestrial bodies (Venus, Titan) but not in that of present Earth, which is distinguished by equatorial easterlies. Nevertheless, superrotation has appeared in numerical simulations of Earth's atmosphere, from two-layer models to multilevel comprehensive GCMs. Simulations of warm climates that generate enhanced tropical convective variability seem particularly prone to superrotation, which has led to hypotheses that the warmer atmospheres of the early Pliocene and Eocene may have been superrotating, and that the phenomenon may be relevant to future climate projections. This paper considers a positive feedback leading to superrotation based on an equatorial wave resonance that occurs in a westerly background flow. The authors present simulations with an idealized multilevel GCM forced with a zonally varying equatorial heating, which show abrupt transitions to strongly superrotating states. Linear shallow water theory is used to show that these transitions occur as the superrotating jet velocity approaches the phase speed of free equatorial Rossby wave modes, leading to a resonant amplification of the response to eddy heating and its associated equatorward momentum flux. The resonance and transition are most prominent in simulations where the meridional temperature gradient has been reduced, and hysteresis behavior is seen when the gradient is eliminated completely. No evidence is found in these simulations for the midlatitude wave feedback believed to drive abrupt transitions in two-layer models, and there is only a minor role for the axisymmetric feedback based on vertical advection by the Hadley circulation.},

In a 2000 km-wide region in the central-eastern Pacific ITCZ, vertical motions import MSE, implying a negative gross moist stability. Horizontal MSE advection is negative and of similar magnitude to vertical MSE advection in rainy regions. Geographic differences in export of MSE by the vertical circulation are primarily due to differences in the shape of the vertical motion profile. In the west Pacific warm pool rainy regions, mean horizontal convergence extends up to 300 mb, while in parts of the Pacific ITCZ where meridional SST gradients are strong, the vertical motion profile is bottom-heavy, with convergence below 800 mb and divergence above. On daily timescales, the mode of vertical motion variability has little dependence on precipitation rate and is consistent with observed regional differences in the vertical structure of TRMM PR reflectivities.},

  abstract = {Abstract We have carried out a numerical investigation of the nature of high-drag states occurring in nonlinear stratified flow over obstacles. In particular, we consider the relative merits of theories which view the drag enhancement as due to linear resonance vs mechanisms which seek to exploit analogies with nonlinear hydraulic theory. First we examine the behavior of the system as a function of the height of a zero-wind line imposed in the ambient flow. The character of the high-drag states conforms well to the predictions of the internal hydraulic analysis of Smith, and cannot he explained in terms of linear resonance. However, a high-drag state emerges even when the initial critical level height is below the lowest predicted resonant height. In this case an upstream-propagating bore is generated which adjusts conditions so as to allow a high-drag sate. Further experiments with a narrow mountain revealed that nonhydrostatic effects do not appreciably affect the behavior for the lowest resonant position, but considerably reduce drag at the higher order resonances. In the second series of experiments, the numerical model is initialized with the idealized high-drag states yielded by Smith's theory, subject to uniform upstream wind conditions. When the mountain is high enough to produce wavebreaking in uniform flow, an overturning region develops at the theoretical level of no motion and a vertically propagating wave emerges aloft; nevertheless, the flow near the ground remains substantially unaltered. When the mountain is too low to support wavebreaking, the mixed region in the lee collapses, and the flow reverts to a nonhydraulic Long's model solution subject to a radiation upper boundary condition. Thus, wavebreaking is a crucial part of the dynamics maintaining the high-drag state. Our results expose some aspects of nonlinear gravity wave critical level behavior that are of general interest. The long term properties of the critical level were found to depend on the phase of the incident wave. Of particular interest are the circumstances in which the critical level acts as an absorber for all time. In this case the convergence of vertical momentum flux is balanced by a divergence of horizontal momentum flux, a state of affairs which can occur only for a horizontally localized wave packet incident an a horizontally unbounded critical level.},

The poleward heat flux generated by baroclinic waves is known to be central in reducing the equator-to-pole temperature gradient from a state of radiative\textendash convective equilibrium. However, invoking this relationship to explain the wide range of equator-to-pole temperature gradients observed in past climates is challenging because baroclinic waves tend to follow the flux\textendash gradient relationship such that their poleward heat flux is proportional to the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and zonal available potential energy (ZAPE). With reanalysis data, the authors show the existence of poleward heat transport by planetary-scale waves that are independent of the flux\textendash gradient relationship and baroclinic instability. This process arises from a forced tapping of atmospheric ZAPE by planetary-scale waves that are triggered by enhanced tropical convection over the Pacific warm pool region. The Rossby waves excited by this tropical convection propagate northeastward over the Pacific Ocean and constructively interfere with the climatological stationary waves at higher latitudes. During polar night, when the current warming is most rapid, the forced tapping of ZAPE by planetary-scale waves produces a substantially greater warming than that by the synoptic-scale eddy fluxes that presumably arise from baroclinic instability.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In this study, an investigation is made into the previously unexplored contribution of the synoptic-scale waves and their attendant atmospheric rivers to the TEAM mechanism. Reanalysis data are used to conduct a suite of observational analyses, trajectory calculations, and idealized model simulations. It is shown that localized tropical convection over the Maritime Continent precedes the peak of the planetary-scale wave life cycle by \textasciitilde 10\textendash 14 days. The Rossby wave source induced by the tropical convection excites a Rossby wave train over the North Pacific that amplifies the climatological December\textendash March stationary waves. These amplified planetary-scale waves are baroclinic and transport sensible and latent heat poleward. During the planetary-scale wave life cycle, synoptic-scale waves are diverted northward over the central North Pacific. The warm conveyor belts associated with the synoptic-scale waves channel moisture from the subtropics into atmospheric rivers that ascend as they move poleward and penetrate into the Arctic near the Bering Strait. At this time, the synoptic-scale waves undergo cyclonic Rossby wave breaking, which further amplifies the planetary-scale waves. The planetary-scale wave life cycle ceases as ridging over Alaska retrogrades westward. The ridging blocks additional moisture transport into the Arctic. However, sensible and latent heat amounts remain elevated over the Arctic, which enhances downward infrared radiation and maintains warm surface temperatures.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)'s Working Group on Climate Modelling (WGCM) Infrastructure Panel (WIP) was formed in 2014 in response to the explosive growth in size and complexity of Coupled Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs) between CMIP3 (2005\textendash 2006) and CMIP5 (2011\textendash 2012). This article presents the WIP recommendations for the global data infrastructure needed to support CMIP design, future growth, and evolution. Developed in close coordination with those who build and run the existing infrastructure (the Earth System Grid Federation; ESGF), the recommendations are based on several principles beginning with the need to separate requirements, implementation, and operations. Other important principles include the consideration of the diversity of community needs around data \textendash{} a data ecosystem \textendash{} the importance of provenance, the need for automation, and the obligation to measure costs and benefits.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}This paper concentrates on requirements, recognizing the diversity of communities involved (modelers, analysts, software developers, and downstream users). Such requirements include the need for scientific reproducibility and accountability alongside the need to record and track data usage. One key element is to generate a dataset-centric rather than system-centric focus, with an aim to making the infrastructure less prone to systemic failure.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}With these overarching principles and requirements, the WIP has produced a set of position papers, which are summarized in the latter pages of this document. They provide specifications for managing and delivering model output, including strategies for replication and versioning, licensing, data quality assurance, citation, long-term archiving, and dataset tracking. They also describe a new and more formal approach for specifying what data, and associated metadata, should be saved, which enables future data volumes to be estimated, particularly for well-defined projects such as CMIP6.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The paper concludes with a future facing consideration of the global data infrastructure evolution that follows from the blurring of boundaries between climate and weather, and the changing nature of published scientific results in the digital age.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Moisture flux convergence (MFC) is a term in the conservation of water vapor equation and was first calculated in the 1950s and 1960s as a vertically integrated quantity to predict rainfall associated with synoptic-scale systems. Vertically integrated MFC was also incorporated into the Kuo cumulus parameterization scheme for the Tropics. MFC was eventually suggested for use in forecasting convective initiation in the midlatitudes in 1970, but practical MFC usage quickly evolved to include only surface data, owing to the higher spatial and temporal resolution of surface observations. Since then, surface MFC has been widely applied as a short-term (0\textendash 3 h) prognostic quantity for forecasting convective initiation, with an emphasis on determining the favorable spatial location(s) for such development. A scale analysis shows that surface MFC is directly proportional to the horizontal mass convergence field, allowing MFC to be highly effective in highlighting mesoscale boundaries between different air masses near the earth's surface that can be resolved by surface data and appropriate grid spacing in gridded analyses and numerical models. However, the effectiveness of boundaries in generating deep moist convection is influenced by many factors, including the depth of the vertical circulation along the boundary and the presence of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) near the boundary. Moreover, lower- and upper-tropospheric jets, frontogenesis, and other forcing mechanisms may produce horizontal mass convergence above the surface, providing the necessary lift to bring elevated parcels to their level of free convection without connection to the boundary layer. Case examples elucidate these points as a context for applying horizontal mass convergence for convective initiation. Because horizontal mass convergence is a more appropriate diagnostic in an ingredients-based methodology for forecasting convective initiation, its use is recommended over MFC.},

Here, we calculate the SWV climate feedback under abrupt \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_2\$\$quadrupling in the CMIP5 ensemble of models. All models robustly show a moistening of the stratosphere, causing a global mean net stratosphere adjusted radiative perturbation of \$\$0.89\textbackslash pm 0.27\textbackslash,\textbackslash hbox \{Wm\}\^\{-2\}\$\$at the reference tropopause. The stratospheric temperature adjustment is a crucial component of this radiative perturbation. The associated climate feedback is \$\$0.17\textbackslash pm 0.05\textbackslash,\textbackslash hbox \{Wm\}\^\{-2\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash hbox\{K\}\^\{-1\}\$\$, with a considerable inter-model range of 0.12\textendash 0.28 \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{Wm\}\^\{-2\}\textbackslash,\textbackslash hbox \{K\}\^\{-1\}\$\$.

The SWV radiative perturbation peaks in the midlatitudes and not the tropics: this is due primarily to increases in SWV in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere, which cause the majority (over three quarters) of the global mean feedback. Based on these results, we suggest an increased focus on understanding drivers of water vapor trends in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere. We conclude that the SWV feedback is important, being on the same order of magnitude as the global mean surface albedo and cloud feedbacks in the multi-model mean.},

The cluster analysis indicates that one of the precursor patterns appears as a mixed pattern consisting of the negative-signed Western Hemisphere circulation pattern and the positive phase of the Pacific-North America pattern. The mixed pattern exhibits higher statistical significance as a precursor pattern of SSWs than other previously identified precursors such as the subpolar North Pacific low, Atlantic blocking, and the western Pacific pattern. Other clusters confirm northern European blocking and Gulf of Alaska blocking as precursors of SSWs. Linear interference with the climatological planetary waves provides a simple interpretation for the precursors.

In contrast to teleconnections, which are typically defined based on the characteristic spatial variations of a meteorological field or on the remote circulation response to a known forcing, LSMPs are defined relative to the occurrence of a specific phenomenon\textemdash here, extreme precipitation\textemdash and with an emphasis on the synoptic scales that have a primary influence in individual events, have medium-range weather predictability, and are well-resolved in both weather and climate models. For the LSMP relationship with extreme precipitation, we consider the previous literature with respect to definitions and data, dynamical mechanisms, model representation, and climate change trends. There is considerable uncertainty in identifying extremes based on existing observational precipitation data and some limitations in analyzing the associated LSMPs in reanalysis data. Many different definitions of ``extreme'' are in use, making it difficult to directly compare different studies. Dynamically, several types of meteorological systems\textemdash extratropical cyclones, tropical cyclones, mesoscale convective systems, and mesohighs\textemdash and several mechanisms\textemdash fronts, atmospheric rivers, and orographic ascent\textemdash have been shown to be important aspects of extreme precipitation LSMPs. The extreme precipitation is often realized through mesoscale processes organized, enhanced, or triggered by the LSMP. Understanding of model representation, trends, and projections for LSMPs is at an early stage, although some promising analysis techniques have been identified and the LSMP perspective is useful for evaluating the model dynamics associated with extremes.},

This spherical effect becomes increasingly important as the mean jet is positioned at higher latitudes. The persistence of the annular mode decreases as the mean jet moves closer to the pole due to the decreased persistence of the high-phase state, while the low-phase state exhibits similar persistence regardless of the jet position. These results suggest that with the expected poleward shift of the jet due to increasing greenhouse gases, the annular mode's total persistence will decrease due to a decrease in the persistence of the high-phase.},

The national FAR for tornado warnings in 2003 was 0.76, indicating that only one in four tornado warnings was verified. The NWS's goal for 2010 is to reduce this value to 0.70. Conventional wisdom is that false alarms reduce the public's willingness to respond to future events. This paper questions this conventional wisdom. In addition, this paper argues that the metrics used to evaluate false alarms do not accurately represent the numbers of actual false alarms or the forecasters' abilities because current metrics categorize events as either a hit or a miss and do not give forecasters credit for close calls. Aspects discussed in this paper include how the NWS FAR is measured, how humans respond to warnings, and what are alternative approaches to measure FAR. A conceptual model is presented as a framework for a new perspective on false alarms that includes close calls, providing a more balanced view of forecast verification.},

Such large environmental changes are already having profound impacts on the flora, fauna, and inhabitants of the Arctic region. An open question, however, is whether these Arctic changes have an effect on the jet-stream and thereby influence weather patterns farther south. This broad question has recently received a lot of scientific and media attention, but conclusions appear contradictory rather than consensual. We argue that one point of confusion has arisen due to ambiguities in the exact question being posed. In this study, we frame our inquiries around three distinct questions: Can Arctic warming influence the midlatitude jet-stream? Has Arctic warming significantly influenced the midlatitude jet-stream? Will Arctic warming significantly influence the midlatitude jet-stream? We argue that framing the discussion around the three questions: Can it?, Has it?, and Will it? provides insight into the common themes emerging in the literature as well as highlights the challenges ahead.

The authors consider separately the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and the Southern Hemisphere jets. The analysis is not limited to annual-mean changes in the latitude and speed of the jets, but also explores how the variability of each jet changes with increased greenhouse gases. All jets are found to migrate poleward with climate change: the Southern Hemisphere jet shifts poleward by 2\textdegree{} of latitude between the historical period and the end of the twenty-first century in the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario, whereas both Northern Hemisphere jets shift by only 1\textdegree. In addition, the speed of the Southern Hemisphere jet is found to increase markedly (by 1.2 m s-1 between 850 and 700 hPa), while the speed remains nearly constant for both jets in the Northern Hemisphere. More importantly, it is found that the patterns of jet variability are a strong function of the jet position in all three sectors of the globe, and as the jets shift poleward the patterns of variability change. Specifically, for the Southern Hemisphere and the North Atlantic jets, the variability becomes less of a north\textendash south wobbling and more of a pulsing (i.e., variation in jet speed). In contrast, for the North Pacific jet, the variability becomes less of a pulsing and more of a north\textendash south wobbling. These different responses can be understood in terms of Rossby wave breaking, allowing the authors to explain most of the projected jet changes within a single dynamical framework.},

This work explores how the eddy-driven jet and its variability persist within these limits. It is demonstrated in a barotropic model that as the jet is located at higher latitudes, the eddy length scale increases as predicted by spherical Rossby wave theory, and the leading mode of variability of the jet changes from a meridional shift to a pulse. Looking equatorward, a similar change in eddy-driven jet variability is observed when it is moved equatorward toward a constant subtropical jet. In both the poleward and equatorward limits, the change in variability from a shift to a pulse is due to the modulation of eddy propagation and momentum flux. Near the pole, the small value of beta (the meridional gradient of absolute vorticity) and subsequent lack of wave breaking near the pole account for the change in variability, whereas on the equatorward side of the jet the strong subtropical winds can affect eddy propagation and restrict the movement of the eddy-driven jet or cause bimodal behavior of the jet latitude. Barotropic quasilinear theory thus suggests that the leading mode of zonal-wind variability will transition from a shift to a pulse as the eddy-driven jets move poleward with climate change, and that the eddy length scale will increase as the jet moves poleward.},

  abstract = {Abstract Spindown experiments have been conducted, using an atmospheric general circulation model, to determine the nature and timescale of adjustment to a baroclinically neutral state. The spindown was obtained by turning off the radiative cooling of the atmosphere\textemdash a procedure, the authors argue, that retains all the relevant constraints on the atmospheric motions. A further experiment with radiation and all other physical parameterizations turned off was performed for comparison. The neutral state was characterized by increased static stability but little reduction in meridional temperature gradient in the main baroclinic zones. However, the zones were observed to narrow and were flanked by regions where the meridional temperature gradient was reduced significantly. This pattern was repeated in the no-physics spin-down experiment but, in the absence of surface friction and strong orographic drag, the flow also appeared to be stabilized by enhanced barotropic shear. The neutral states from these two experiments are compared with those predicted by baroclinic adjustment theories and those seen in eddy life cycle experiments. The adjustment of temperature was roughly exponential, on a timescale of 15\textendash 20 days. A spin-up experiment was also performed where the radiation was turned back on in the adjusted state. The original climate was restored on a timescale of 5\textendash 10 days. Since both radiation and eddies are acting in the spinup, this implies a purely radiative forcing timescale of the same order as the adjustment timescale, which adds to the evidence that the mean atmospheric state cannot be said to be baroclinically adjusted.},

It is shown that in comprehensive climate models, such loss of Arctic winter sea ice area is faster than the preceding loss of summer sea ice area for the same rate of warming. In two of the models, several million square kilometers of winter sea ice are lost within only one decade. It is shown that neither surface albedo nor cloud feedbacks can explain the rapid winter ice loss in the climate model MPI-ESM by suppressing both feedbacks in the model. The authors argue that the large sensitivity of winter sea ice area in the models is caused by the asymmetry between melting and freezing: an ice-free summer requires the complete melt of even the thickest sea ice, which is why the perennial ice coverage decreases only gradually as more and more of the thinner ice melts away. In winter, however, sea ice areal coverage remains high as long as sea ice still forms, and then drops to zero wherever the ocean warms sufficiently to no longer form ice during winter. The loss of basinwide Arctic winter sea ice area, however, is still gradual in most models since the threshold mechanism proposed here is reversible and not associated with the existence of multiple steady states. As this occurs in every model analyzed here and is independent of any specific parameterization, it is likely to be relevant in the real world.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Preliminary applications in a global numerical weather-prediction model and a mesoscale model are also discussed. The results suggest that the present scheme provides reasonable solutions in terms of predicted rainfall, and tropical temperature and moisture structures. The application of the scheme to various scales is supported by the use of a convective available potential energy convective closure that assures a smooth interaction with the large-scale environment and efficiently suppresses conditional instability of the second kind-like spin-up processes on the grid-scale.

These ``above anvil cirrus plumes'' (AACPs) exhibit unique temperature and reflectance patterns in satellite imagery, best recognized within 1-min ``super rapid scan'' observations. AACPs are often evident during severe weather outbreaks and, due to their importance, have been studied for 35+ years. Despite this research, there is uncertainty regarding why some storms produce AACPs but other nearby storms do not, exactly how severe are storms with AACPs, and how AACP identification can assist with severe weather warning. These uncertainties are addressed through analysis of severe weather reports, NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS) severe weather warnings, metrics of updraft cloud height, intensity, and rotation derived from Doppler radars, as well as ground-based total lightning observations for 4583 storms observed by GOES super rapid scanning, 405 of which produced an AACP. Datasets are accumulated throughout storm lifetimes through radar object tracking. It is found that 1) AACP storms generated 14 times the number of reports per storm compared to non-AACP storms; 2) AACPs appeared, on average, 31 min in advance of severe weather; 3) 73\% of significant severe weather reports were produced by AACP storms; 4) AACP recognition can provide comparable warning lead time to that provided by a forecaster; and 5) the presence of an AACP can increase forecaster confidence that large hail will occur. Given that AACPs occur throughout the world, and most of the world is not observed by Doppler radar, AACP-based severe storm identification and warning would be extremely helpful for protecting lives and property.},

  abstract = {Abstract The processes that contribute to the Arctic amplification of global surface warming are often described in the context of climate feedbacks. Previous studies have used a traditional feedback analysis framework to partition the regional surface warming into contributions from each feedback process. However, this partitioning can be complicated by interactions in the climate system. Here we focus instead on the physically intuitive approach of inactivating individual feedback processes during forced warming and evaluating the resulting change in the surface temperature field. We investigate this using a moist energy balance model with spatially varying feedbacks that are specified from comprehensive climate model results. We find that when warming is attributed to each feedback process by comparing how the climate would change if the process were not active, the water vapor feedback is the primary reason that the Arctic region warms more than the tropics, and the lapse rate feedback has a neutral effect on Arctic amplification by cooling the Arctic and the tropics by approximately equivalent amounts. These results are strikingly different from previous feedback analyses, which identified the lapse rate feedback as the largest contributor to Arctic amplification, with the water vapor feedback being the main opposing factor by warming the tropics more than the Arctic region. This highlights the importance of comparing different approaches of analyzing how feedbacks contribute to warming in order to build a better understanding of how feedbacks influence climate changes.},

The precipitation accumulation, near-surface winds, and surface downward longwave irradiance predicted by the model were in good agreement with SHEBA observations during this period. However, surface downward longwave irradiance was underestimated by 10 W m-2 on average when low clouds were present in the model and observations. The model demonstrated considerable skill in predicting the occurrence and vertical extent of cloudiness over SHEBA, with some tendency to overestimate the frequency of clouds below 1 km. A synthetic radar reflectivity estimated from the ECMWF model variables was compared with 8 mm wavelength radar measurements. The two were broadly consistent only if the assumed snowflake size distribution over SHEBA had a smaller proportion of large flakes than was found in previous studies at lower latitudes. The ECMWF model assumes a temperature-dependent partitioning of cloud condensate between water and ice. Lidar depolarization measurements at SHEBA indicate that both liquid and ice phase clouds occurred over a wide range of temperatures throughout the winter season, with liquid occurring at temperatures as low as 239 K. A much larger fraction of liquid water clouds was observed than the ECMWF model predicted. The largest discrepancies between the ECMWF model and the observations were in surface temperature (up to 15 K) and turbulent sensible heat fluxes (up to 60 W m-2). These appear to be due at least partially to the ECMWF sea ice model, which did not allow surface temperatures to respond nearly as rapidly to changing atmospheric conditions as was observed.},

These are discussed in the context of changes to the global observing system. Temperature, integrated water vapor (IWV), and kinetic energy are considered. The ERA40 global mean temperature in the lower troposphere has a trend of +0.11 K per decade over the period of 1979\textendash 2001, which is slightly higher than the MSU measurements, but within the estimated error limit. For the period 1958\textendash 2001 the warming trend is 0.14 K per decade but this is likely to be an artifact of changes in the observing system. When this is corrected for, the warming trend is reduced to 0.10 K per decade. The global trend in IWV for the period 1979\textendash 2001 is +0.36 mm per decade. This is about twice as high as the trend determined from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation assuming conservation of relative humidity. It is also larger than results from free climate model integrations driven by the same observed sea surface temperature as used in ERA40. It is suggested that the large trend in IWV does not represent a genuine climate trend but an artifact caused by changes in the global observing system such as the use of SSM/I and more satellite soundings in later years. Recent results are in good agreement with GPS measurements. The IWV trend for the period 1958\textendash 2001 is still higher but reduced to +0.16 mm per decade when corrected for changes in the observing systems. Total kinetic energy shows an increasing global trend. Results from data assimilation experiments strongly suggest that this trend is also incorrect and mainly caused by the huge changes in the global observing system in 1979. When this is corrected for, no significant change in global kinetic energy from 1958 onward can be found.},

In the Arctic the annual evaporation is {$\sim$}8000 km3 but {$\sim$}3000 km3 less in the Antarctica where the net horizontal transport is correspondingly larger. The net water transport of the model is more intense than in ERA-Interim, in the Arctic the difference is 2.5\% and in the Antarctic it is 6.2\%. Precipitation and net horizontal transport in the Arctic has a maximum in August and September. Evaporation peaks in June and July. The seasonal cycle is similar in Antarctica with the highest precipitation in the austral autumn. The largest net transport occurs at the end of the major extra-tropical storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere such as the eastern Pacific and eastern north Atlantic.The variability of themodel is virtually identical to that of the re-analysis and there are no changes in variability between the present climate and the climate at the end of the 21st century when normalized with the higher level of moisture. The changes from year to year are substantial with the 20- and 30-year records being generally too short to identify robust trends in the hydrological cycle.In the A1B climate scenario the strength of the water cycle increases by some 25\% in the Arctic and by 19\% in the Antarctica, as measured by annual precipitation. The increase in the net horizontal transport is 29\% and 22\%, respectively, and the increase in evaporation correspondingly less. The net transport follows closely the Clausius\textemdash Clapeyron relation. There is a minor change in the annual cycle of the Arctic atmospheric water cycle with the maximum transport and precipitation occurring later in the year.There is a small imbalance of some 4\textendash 6\% between the net transport and precipitation minus evaporation. We suggest that this is mainly due to the fact that the transport is calculated from instantaneous six hourly data while precipitation and evaporation is accumulated over a 6-h period. The residual difference is proportionally similar for all experiments and hardly varies from year to year.},

Results show that the surface inhomogeneity affects the fluxes at small scales but not in the domain average. The independent pixel approximation (IPA) and plane-parallel approximation (PPA) can produce accurate domain-average fluxes for low Arctic clouds, although the IPA can create large local errors. Measured and modeled fluxes are reasonably well matched, within the bounds of uncertainty in the model inputs, of which surface albedo has the largest impact. The fluxes are also sensitive to cloud liquid water path, cloud droplet effective radius, and aerosol amount.},

Evidence suggests that the primary warm season derecho corridor is located in the southern Great Plains. During the cool season, derecho activity was found to occur in the southeast states and along the Atlantic seaboard.

  abstract = {Abstract Changes to mean and extreme wet season precipitation over California on interannual time scales are analyzed using twenty-first-century precipitation data from 34 global climate models. Models disagree on the sign of projected changes in mean precipitation, although in most models the change is very small compared to historical and simulated levels of interannual variability. For the 2020/21\textendash 2059/60 period, there is no projected increase in the frequency of extremely dry wet seasons in the ensemble mean. Wet extremes are found to increase to around 2 times the historical frequency, which is statistically significant at the 95\% level. Stronger signals emerge in the 2060/61\textendash 2099/2100 period. Across all models, extremely dry wet seasons are roughly 1.5 to 2 times more common, and wet extremes generally triple in their historical frequency (statistically significant). Large increases in precipitation variability in most models account for the modest increases to dry extremes. Increases in the frequency of wet extremes can be ascribed to equal contributions from increased variability and increases to the mean. These increases in the frequency of interannual precipitation extremes will create severe water management problems in a region where coping with large interannual variability in precipitation is already a challenge. Evidence from models and observations is examined to understand the causes of the low precipitation associated with the 2013/14 drought in California. These lines of evidence all strongly indicate that the low 2013/14 wet season precipitation total can be very likely attributed to natural variability, in spite of the projected future changes in extremes.},

Recent studies have shown that a large-scale circulation may spontaneously develop from radiative-convective equilibrium through the interactions among water vapor, radiation, and convection. This potential instability, referred to as radiative-convective instability, may be posed as a linear stability problem for the water vapor profile by combining a linear response framework with the weak temperature gradient approximation. We design two analytic models of convective linear response to moisture perturbations, which are similar to Betts-Miller and bulk-plume convection schemes. We combine these convective responses with either clear-sky gray or real-gas radiative responses. In all cases, despite consistent radiative feedbacks, the characteristics of convection dominate the vertical structure of the most unstable linear mode of water vapor perturbations. For Betts-Miller convection, the stability critically depend on a key parameter: the heating to advection of moisture conversion rate (HAM); warmer atmospheres with higher HAM exhibit more linear instability. In contrast, bulk-plume convection is stable across temperatures but becomes linearly unstable with a moisture mode peaking in the midtroposphere once combined to radiation, with approximate growth rates of 10 days.},

The possibility that RCE may be unstable to development of large-scale circulation has been raised by recent modeling, theoretical, and observational studies, and could have profound consequences for our understanding of tropical meteorology and climate. Here, we study the interaction between moisture and radiative cooling as a contributor to instability of RCE. We focus on whether the total atmospheric radiative cooling decreases with column water vapor; this condition, which we call moisture-radiative cooling instability (MRCI), provides the potential for unstable growth of moist or dry perturbations. Analytic solutions to the gray-gas radiative transfer equations show that MRCI is satisfied when the total column optical depth\textemdash linked to column water vapor\textemdash exceeds a critical threshold. Both the threshold and the growth rate of the instability depend strongly on the shape of the water vapor perturbation. Calculations with a realistic radiative transfer model confirm the existence of MRCI for typical tropical values of column water vapor, but show even stronger dependence on the vertical structure of water vapor perturbation. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of atmospheric radiative cooling to variability in column water vapor in observed tropical soundings. We find that clear-sky MRCI is satisfied across a range of locations and seasons in the real tropical atmosphere, with a partial growth rate of {$\sim$}1 month.},

Historical simulations can capture the magnitude of the centennial Sahel drying over the span of the 20th century and confirm that anthropogenic forcings have contributed substantially to it. Yet, the models do not reproduce the amplitude of observed oscillations at multidecadal timescales, suggesting that either oscillations in the forcing or the strength of natural variability are underestimated. Projections for Sahel rainfall are less robust than the 20th century hindcast and outlier projections persist, but overall the CMIP5 models confirm the CMIP3 results in many details and reaffirm the prediction of a rainy season that is more feeble at its start, especially in West Africa, and more abundant at its core across the entire Sahel.

Idealized simulations from a subset of the CMIP5 ensemble\textemdash simulations designed to separate the fast land-atmosphere response to increased greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the slow response mediated through changes in sea surface temperature (SST)\textemdash confirm that the direct effect of CO2 is to enhance the monsoon, while warmer SST induce drying over the Sahel.

The continental-scale monsoon systems are also facets of a momentum- and energy-constrained global circulation, but their modern and palaeo variability deviates substantially from that of the intertropical convergence zone. The mechanisms underlying deviations from expectations based on the longitudinal mean budgets are neither fully understood nor simulated accurately. We argue that a framework grounded in global constraints on energy and momentum yet encompassing the complexities of monsoon dynamics is needed to identify the causes of the mismatch between theory, models and observations, and ultimately to improve regional climate projections. In a first step towards this goal, disparate regional processes must be distilled into gross measures of energy flow in and out of continents and between the surface and the tropopause, so that monsoon dynamics may be coherently diagnosed across modern and palaeo observations and across idealized and comprehensive simulations. Accounting for zonal asymmetries in the circulation, land/ocean differences in surface fluxes, and the character of convective systems, such a monsoon framework would integrate our understanding at all relevant scales: from the fine details of how moisture and energy are lifted in the updrafts of thunderclouds, up to the global circulations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Changes in atmospheric forcing can affect the subsurface water column of the ocean by three different mechanisms. First, warmed mixed-layer water that is subducted into the ocean interior will cause subsurface warming; second, the subducted surface water can be freshened through changes in evaporation and precipitation; and third, the properties at a given depth may be changed by the vertical displacement of isotherms and isohalines without changes of water masses. These vertical displacements of the water column can be caused either by changes in the rates of renewal of water masses or by dynamical changes (such as changes in wind stress). A method for analysing the subsurface temporal changes in hydrographic data is described in terms of these three processes: ``pure warming,'' ``pure freshening,'' and ``pure heave.'' Linear relations are derived for the relative strength of each process in terms of the observed changes of potential temperature and salinity in two different coordinate frames: (i) constant density surfaces, and (ii) isobaric surfaces. Inverse methods are applied to three realizations of the SCORPIO section at 43\textdegree S in the Tasman Sea. These sections were obtained in 1967, and in the austral winter and summer of 1989 and 1990, respectively. This data is used to explore the relative strengths of surface warming, surface freshening, and heave of the water column. The six-month differences for this region show small changes in Sub-Antarctic mode water (SAMW) and are not characterized by any one process, whereas below the mode waters the observed differences are well described by the heave process. In contrast, the 23-year differences show significant changes in the properties of the water that flows into the Tasman Sea: SAMW (300-700 db) is well described by pure warming of near- surface waters, while the changes observed at the depth of the salinity minimum are consistent with pure freshening. The observed changes in the interior of the ocean between adjacent seasons do not exhibit significant changes of water masses, consistent with the distance of this section from the outcrop region of the density surfaces of interest. For the 23-year differences, changed surface waters subducted into the ocean interior have sufficient time to influence the temperature-salinity correlations. The skill of our approach in discriminating between short-term changes (almost exclusively heave) and long-term changes associated with the subduction of changed surface waters is particularly encouraging. Although the observed changes could equally well be natural variability, they are qualitatively consistent with coupled numerical models of climate change in which surface waters are warmed and increased precipitation occurs south of the Sub-Antarctic Front.},

  abstract = {Amplified Arctic warming is one of the key features of climate change. It is evident in observations as well as in climate model simulations. Usually referred to as Arctic amplification, it is generally recognized that the surface albedo feedback governs the response. However, a number of feedback mechanisms play a role in AA, of which those related to the prevalent near-surface inversion have received relatively little attention. Here we investigate the role of the near-surface thermal inversion, which is caused by radiative surface cooling in autumn and winter, on Arctic warming. We employ idealized climate change experiments using the climate model EC-Earth together with ERA-Interim reanalysis data to show that boundary-layer mixing governs the efficiency by which the surface warming signal is `diluted' to higher levels. Reduced vertical mixing, as in the stably stratified inversion layer in Arctic winter, thus amplifies surface warming. Modelling results suggest that both shortwave\textemdash through the (seasonal) interaction with the sea ice feedback\textemdash and longwave feedbacks are affected by boundary-layer mixing, both in the Arctic and globally, with the effect on the shortwave feedback dominating. The amplifying effect will decrease, however, with climate warming because the surface inversion becomes progressively weaker. We estimate that the reduced Arctic inversion has slowed down global warming by about 5\% over the past 2 decades, and we anticipate that it will continue to do so with ongoing Arctic warming.},

  abstract = {Ongoing and projected greenhouse warming clearly manifests itself in the Arctic regions, which warm faster than any other part of the world. One of the key features of amplified Arctic warming concerns Arctic winter warming (AWW), which exceeds summer warming by at least a factor of 4. Here we use observation-driven reanalyses and state-of-the-art climate models in a variety of standardised climate change simulations to show that AWW is strongly linked to winter sea ice retreat through the associated release of surplus ocean heat gained in summer through the ice-albedo feedback (\textasciitilde 25\%) and to infrared radiation feedbacks (\textasciitilde 75\%). Arctic summer warming is surprisingly modest, even after summer sea ice has completely disappeared. Quantifying the seasonally varying changes in Arctic temperature and sea ice and the associated feedbacks helps to more accurately quantify the likelihood of Arctic's climate changes and to assess their impact on local ecosystems and socio-economic activities.},

  abstract = {The role of eddy fluxes in the general circulation is often approached by treating eddies as (macro)turbulence. In this approach, the eddies act to diffuse certain quasi-conservative quantities, such as potential vorticity (PV), along isentropic surfaces in the free atmosphere. The eddy fluxes are determined primarily by the eddy diffusivities and are necessarily down-gradient of the basic state PV field. Support for the (macro)turbulence approach stems from the fact that the eddy fluxes of PV in the free atmosphere are generally down-gradient in the long-term mean. Here we call attention to a pronounced and significant region of up-gradient eddy PV fluxes on the poleward flank of the jet core in both hemispheres. The region of up-gradient (i.e., notionally ``antidiffusive'') eddy PV fluxes is most pronounced during the winter and spring seasons and partially contradicts the turbulence approach described above. Analyses of the PV variance (potential enstrophy) budget suggest that the up-gradient PV fluxes represent local wave decay and are maintained by poleward fluxes of PV variance. Finite-amplitude effects thus represent leading order contributions to the PV variance budget, whereas dissipation is only of secondary importance locally. The appearance of up-gradient PV fluxes in the long-term mean is associated with the poleward shift of the jet\textemdash and thus the region of wave decay relative to wave growth\textemdash following wave-breaking events.},

Globally, permafrost temperature increased by 0.29\,{$\pm$}\,0.12\,\textdegree C. The observed trend follows the Arctic amplification of air temperature increase in the Northern Hemisphere.

  abstract = {Climate simulations by 16 atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are compared on an aqua-planet, a water-covered Earth with prescribed sea surface temperature varying only in latitude. The idealised configuration is designed to expose differences in the circulation simulated by different models. Basic features of the aqua-planet climate are characterised by comparison with Earth.The models display a wide range of behaviour. The balanced component of the tropospheric mean flow, and mid-latitude eddy covariances subject to budget constraints, vary relatively little among the models. In contrast, differences in damping in the dynamical core strongly influence transient eddy amplitudes. Historical uncertainty in modelled lower stratospheric temperatures persists in APE.Aspects of the circulation generated more directly by interactions between the resolved fluid dynamics and parameterized moist processes vary greatly. The tropical Hadley circulation forms either a single or double inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) at the equator, with large variations in mean precipitation. The equatorial wave spectrum shows a wide range of precipitation intensity and propagation characteristics. Kelvin mode-like eastward propagation with remarkably constant phase speed dominates in most models. Westward propagation, less dispersive than the equatorial Rossby modes, dominates in a few models or occurs within an eastward propagating envelope in others. The mean structure of the ITCZ is related to precipitation variability, consistent with previous studies.The aqua-planet global energy balance is unknown but the models produce a surprisingly large range of top of atmosphere global net flux, dominated by differences in shortwave reflection by clouds. A number of newly developed models, not optimised for Earth climate, contribute to this. Possible reasons for differences in the optimised models are discussed.The aqua-planet configuration is intended as one component of an experimental hierarchy used to evaluate AGCMs. This comparison does suggest that the range of model behaviour could be better understood and reduced in conjunction with Earth climate simulations. Controlled experimentation is required to explore individual model behaviour and investigate convergence of the aqua-planet climate with increasing resolution.},

In this study, results are presented from a sea ice perturbation experiment using the coupled Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). By decreasing the albedo of the sea ice, the impact of an ice-free summertime Arctic on the coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere system is isolated in an idealized but energetically self-consistent way. The multicentury equilibrium response is examined, as well as the transient response in an initial condition ensemble. The perturbation drives pronounced year-round sea ice thinning, Arctic warming, Arctic amplification, and moderate global warming. Even in the almost complete absence of summertime sea ice, the atmospheric general circulation response is very weak and the transient response is small compared to the internal variability. Surface temperature variability is reduced on all time scales over most of the middle and high latitudes with a 50\% reduction in the standard deviation of temperature over the Arctic Ocean. The reduction is attributed to decreased temperature gradients and increased maritime influence once the sea ice melts. This reduced variability extends weakly into the variability of the midlatitude and free tropospheric geopotential height (less than 10\% reduction in the standard deviation). Consistently, eddy geopotential height variability is found to decrease while geopotential isopleth meandering, which reflects Arctic amplified warming, increases moderately. The sign of these changes is consistent with recent observations, but the size of these changes is relatively small.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A {$<$}em{$>$}pattern scaling{$<$}/em{$>$} approach is proposed in which the local multidecadal mean atmospheric response is assumed to be separately proportional to the total sea ice loss and to the total low-latitude ocean surface warming. The proposed approach estimates the response to Arctic sea ice loss with low-latitude ocean temperatures fixed and vice versa. The sea ice response includes a high northern latitude easterly zonal wind response, an equatorward shift of the eddy-driven jet, a weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex, an anticyclonic sea level pressure anomaly over coastal Eurasia, a cyclonic sea level pressure anomaly over the North Pacific, and increased wintertime precipitation over the west coast of North America. Many of these responses are opposed by the response to low-latitude surface warming with sea ice fixed. However, both sea ice loss and low-latitude surface warming act in concert to reduce subseasonal temperature variability throughout the middle and high latitudes. The responses are similar in two related versions of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Earth system models, apart from the stratospheric polar vortex response. Evidence is presented that internal variability can easily contaminate the estimates if not enough independent climate states are used to construct them.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Coupled AOGCM experiments driven by sea ice albedo reduction and greenhouse gas\textendash dominated radiative forcing are used to diagnose the extratropical sea surface temperature (SST) response to sea ice loss. Sea ice loss is then imposed in AGCM experiments both with and without these extratropical SST changes, which are found to extend beyond the regions where sea ice is lost. Sea ice loss in isolation drives warming that is confined to the Arctic lower troposphere and only a weak atmospheric circulation response. When the extratropical SST response caused by sea ice loss is also included in the forcing, the warming extends into the Arctic midtroposphere during winter. This coincides with a stronger atmospheric circulation response, including an equatorward shift in the eddy-driven jet, a deepening of the Aleutian low, and an expansion of the Siberian high. Similar results are found whether the extratropical SST forcing is taken directly from the AOGCM driven by sea ice loss, or whether they are diagnosed using a two-parameter pattern scaling technique where tropical adjustment to sea ice loss is removed. These results suggest that AGCM experiments that are driven by sea ice loss and only local SST increases will underestimate the Arctic midtroposphere warming and atmospheric circulation response to sea ice loss, compared to AOGCM simulations and the real world.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

For two to three decades starting from the mid-1980s, accelerated Arctic warming and a reduced meridional near-surface temperature gradient coincided with a wavier circulation. However, waviness remains largely unchanged in model simulations featuring strong Arctic amplification. Here, we show that the previously reported trend toward a wavier circulation during autumn and winter has reversed in recent years, despite continued Arctic amplification, resulting in negligible multidecadal trends. Models capture the observed correspondence between a reduced temperature gradient and increased waviness on interannual to decadal time scales. However, model experiments in which a reduced temperature gradient is imposed do not feature increased wave amplitude. Our results strongly suggest that the observed and simulated covariability between waviness and temperature gradients on interannual to decadal time scales does not represent a forced response to Arctic amplification.

We use regression analysis to quantify the links between Arctic sea ice and midlatitude winter climate in observations and large initial-condition ensembles of multiple climate models, in both coupled configurations and so-called Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) configurations, where observed sea ice and/or sea surface temperatures are prescribed. The coupled models capture the observed links in interannual variability between winter Barents\textendash Kara sea ice and Eurasian surface temperature, and between winter Chukchi\textendash Bering sea ice and North American surface temperature. The coupled models also capture the delayed connection between reduced November\textendash December Barents\textendash Kara sea ice, a weakened winter stratospheric polar vortex, and a shift toward the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in late winter, although this downward impact is weaker than observed. The strength and sign of the connections both vary considerably between individual 35-yr-long ensemble members, highlighting the need for large ensembles to separate robust connections from internal variability. All the aforementioned links are either absent or are substantially weaker in the AMIP experiments prescribed with only observed sea ice variability. We conclude that the causal effects of sea ice variability on midlatitude winter climate are much weaker than suggested by statistical associations, evident in observations and coupled models, because the statistics are inflated by the effects of atmospheric circulation variability on sea ice.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Observations and model output generally match, exhibiting a red-noise spectrum, where significant correlation (or memory) is lost within 2\textendash 5 months. September sea ice extent is significantly correlated with extent of the previous August and July, and thus these months show a predictive skill of the summer minimum extent. Beyond this initial loss of memory, there is an increase in correlation\textemdash a reemergence of memory\textemdash that is more ubiquitous in the model than observations. There are two distinct modes of memory reemergence in the model. The first, a summer-to-summer reemergence arises within the model from the persistence of thickness anomalies and their influence on ice area. The second, which is also seen in observations, is associated with anomalies in the growth season that originate in the melt season. This reemergence stems from the several-month persistence of SSTs. In the model memory reemergence is enhanced by the sea ice albedo feedback. The same mechanisms that give rise to reemergence also enhance the 1-month lagged correlation during summer and winter. The study finds the least correlation between successive months when the sea ice is most rapidly advancing or retreating.},

Feedback temperature dependence is positive for 10 out of 14 models, primarily due to the longwave clear-sky feedback, while cloud feedbacks drive particularly large sensitivity increases.

  abstract = {Abstract The sensitivity of the climate to CO2 forcing depends on spatially varying radiative feedbacks that act both locally and nonlocally. We assess whether a method employing multiple regression can be used to estimate local and nonlocal radiative feedbacks from internal variability. We test this method on millennial-length simulations performed with six coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Given the spatial pattern of warming, the method does quite well at recreating the top-of-atmosphere flux response for most regions of Earth, except over the Southern Ocean where it consistently overestimates the change, leading to an overestimate of the sensitivity. For five of the six models, the method finds that local feedbacks are positive due to cloud processes, balanced by negative nonlocal shortwave cloud feedbacks associated with regions of tropical convection. For four of these models, the magnitudes of both are comparable to the Planck feedback, so that changes in the ratio between them could lead to large changes in climate sensitivity. The positive local feedback explains why observational studies that estimate spatial feedbacks using only local regressions predict an unstable climate. The method implies that sensitivity in these AOGCMs increases over time due to a reduction in the share of warming occurring in tropical convecting regions and the resulting weakening of associated shortwave cloud and longwave clear-sky feedbacks. Our results provide a step toward an observational estimate of time-varying climate sensitivity by demonstrating that many aspects of spatial feedbacks appear to be the same between internal variability and the forced response.},

July cloud cover is simulated at three locations over the subtropical northeast Pacific Ocean, which are typified by cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) under well-mixed stratocumulus, cool SSTs under decoupled stratocumulus, and shallow cumulus clouds overlying warmer SSTs. The idealized climate change includes a uniform 2 K SST increase with corresponding moist-adiabatic warming aloft and subsidence changes, but no change in free-tropospheric relative humidity, surface wind speed, or CO2. For each case, realistic advective forcings and boundary conditions are generated for the control and perturbed states which each LES runs for 10 days into a quasi-steady state. For the control climate, the LESs correctly produce the expected cloud type at all three locations. With the perturbed forcings, all models simulate boundary-layer deepening due to reduced subsidence in the warmer climate, with less deepening at the warm-SST location due to regulation by precipitation. The models do not show a consistent response of liquid water path and albedo in the perturbed climate, though the majority predict cloud thickening (negative cloud feedback) at the cold-SST location and slight cloud thinning (positive cloud feedback) at the cool-SST and warm-SST locations. In perturbed climate simulations at the cold-SST location without the subsidence decrease, cloud albedo consistently decreases across the models. Thus, boundary-layer cloud feedback on climate change involves compensating thermodynamic and dynamic effects of warming and may interact with patterns of subsidence change.},

While the majority of research has focused on the near-surface level heating and radiative forcing, one under-explored area of research is the change in temperature and heating rates throughout the stratosphere and upper troposphere, particularly during the winter months (December\textendash February). For instance, reanalysis data has revealed that the Arctic middle-lower stratosphere has been warming at a rate of approximately 0.5 K/decade over the 1980\textendash 2019 period in contrast to the prevailing cooling trends in the other regions of the stratosphere. To understand what is driving these non-negligible temperature trends, this work investigates the underlying dynamical and radiative heating rates over the same 40-year period. It is found that dynamics is the main driver of the stratospheric temperature change in the Arctic, with the middle-lower stratospheric warming being largely explained by trends in adiabatic motion. In comparison, besides the dynamical effects, the tropospheric warming trend is also driven radiatively by surface warming and thermodynamically by latent heating. Lastly, it is found that the stratospheric warming trend mainly occurs in the years with sudden stratospheric warming events, highlighting the influence of these events in driving the stratospheric temperature trends.},

Despite state-of-the-art climate models capturing the rapid nature of Arctic climate change, termed Arctic amplification, they significantly disagree on its magnitude. Using a regional, process-oriented surface energy budget analysis, we argue that differences in seasonal energy exchanges in sea ice retreat regions via increased absorption and storage of sunlight in summer and increased upward surface turbulent fluxes in fall/winter contribute to the inter-model spread. Models able to more widely disperse energy drawn from the surface in sea ice retreat regions warm more, suggesting that differences in the local Arctic atmospheric circulation response contribute to the inter-model spread. We find that the principle mechanisms driving the inter-model spread in Arctic amplification operate locally on regional scales, requiring an improved understanding of atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interactions in sea ice retreat regions to reduce the spread.},

It builds on recent improvements in models, in the reanalysis of climate data, in methods of initialization and ensemble generation, and in data treatment and analysis to propose an extended comprehensive decadal prediction investigation as a contribution to CMIP6 (Eyring et al., 2016) and to the WCRP Grand Challenge on Near Term Climate Prediction (Kushnir et al., 2016). The DCPP consists of three components. Component A comprises the production and analysis of an extensive archive of retrospective forecasts to be used to assess and understand historical decadal prediction skill, as a basis for improvements in all aspects of end-to-end decadal prediction, and as a basis for forecasting on annual to decadal timescales. Component B undertakes ongoing production, analysis and dissemination of experimental quasi-real-time multi-model forecasts as a basis for potential operational forecast production. Component C involves the organization and coordination of case studies of particular climate shifts and variations, both natural and naturally forced (e.g. the ``hiatus'', volcanoes), including the study of the mechanisms that determine these behaviours.

  abstract = {Abstract The mid- and high-latitude variations of mass and momentum, variously termed the Arctic and Antarctic oscillations and/or the Northern and Southern Annular Modes also have a signature in the moisture budget. This is investigated, using associated regression pattern analysis, in the control simulation of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) coupled climate model and in NCEP reanalysis data. The analyzed behavior is similar in the two hemispheres and is characterized, when pressure is low in polar regions, by anomalous westerlies and a thermodynamically indirect meridional cell poleward of midlatitudes, and by anomalous easterlies and a thermodynamically direct meridional cell equatorward of midlatitudes. Moisture transports are associated primarily with advection by the lower branches of these anomalous meridional circulation cells and secondarily with anomalous eddy transports giving, in this phase of the mode, moisture divergence and decreased precipitation at midlatitudes and moisture convergence and increased precipitation at poleward latitudes. The opposite behavior is seen when pressure is high in polar regions. Patterns tend to be more zonally symmetric in the Southern than the Northern Hemisphere in both model results and reanalyses. The meridional circulations and eddy transports that affect the moisture budget at lower levels in the atmosphere extend throughout the troposphere and are those associated also with the momentum budget of the annular modes. The annular modes should be considered as interlinked variations of mass, momentum, and moisture. The amplitudes of the annular modes and associated moisture quantities exhibit an upward trend in both hemispheres in simulations with the CCCma coupled model forced with historical and projected greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosol loadings for the period 1900\textendash 2100. It appears, however, that the behavior of the annular modes and their signature in the moisture budget is basically unchanged and is superimposed on a forced climate trend.},

Observations and recently suggested fingerprints of AMOC variability indicate a gradual weakening during the last decades, but estimates of the critical transition point remain uncertain.

Significant early-warning signals are found in eight independent AMOC indices, based on observational sea-surface temperature and salinity data from across the Atlantic Ocean basin.

There are indications that cold winters in the Arctic stratosphere have been getting colder, raising the question if and to what extent a cooling of the Arctic stratosphere may continue into the future. We use meteorological reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim and NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) for the past 32 yr together with calculations of the chemistry-climate model (CCM) ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) and models from the Chemistry-Climate Model Validation (CCMVal) project to infer radiative and dynamical contributions to long-term Arctic stratospheric temperature changes. For the past three decades the reanalyses show a warming trend in winter and cooling trend in spring and summer, which agree well with trends from the Radiosonde Innovation Composite Homogenization (RICH) adjusted radiosonde data set. Changes in winter and spring are caused by a corresponding change of planetary wave activity with increases in winter and decreases in spring. During winter the increase of planetary wave activity is counteracted by a residual radiatively induced cooling. Stratospheric radiatively induced cooling is detected throughout all seasons, being highly significant in spring and summer. This means that for a given dynamical situation, according to ERA-Interim the annual mean temperature of the Arctic lower stratosphere has been cooling by -0.41 {$\pm$} 0.11 K decade\textsuperscript{\&minus;1} at 50 hPa over the past 32 yr. Calculations with state-of-the-art models from CCMVal and the EMAC model qualitatively reproduce the radiatively induced cooling for the past decades, but underestimate the amount of radiatively induced cooling deduced from reanalyses. There are indications that this discrepancy could be partly related to a possible underestimation of past Arctic ozone trends in the models. The models project a continued cooling of the Arctic stratosphere over the coming decades (2001\textendash 2049) that is for the annual mean about 40\% less than the modeled cooling for the past, due to the reduction of ozone depleting substances and the resulting ozone recovery. This projected cooling in turn could offset between 15 and 40\% of the Arctic ozone recovery.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Moisture flux rates, produced using Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data, from the Arctic Ocean and surrounding seas were found to have increased between 2003 and 2013 by 7.2 \texttimes{} 10-4 g m-2 s-1 per year (equivalent to 1.79 W m-2 per year in latent heat). This is a 7\% increase in the average moisture flux each year and a 0.12\% increase in the yearly global ocean latent heat flux, with some months increasing more than others. The largest increases seen are in the Arctic coastal seas during the spring and fall where there has been a reduction in sea ice cover and an increase in sea surface temperatures. Increases in the moisture flux from the surface also correspond to increases in total atmospheric column water vapor and low-level clouds, especially in the central Arctic regions. Changes in the atmospheric water vapor in the surrounding seas (e.g., East Greenland) are most likely due to lower latitude transport of moisture rather than from the surface. Yearly, the moisture flux from the surface supplies about 10\% of the total column atmosphere water vapor.},

  abstract = {Evaporation from the Arctic Ocean and its marginal seas is essential for air moisture, cloudiness, and precipitation, as well as for the associated feedbacks, which contribute to the Arctic amplification of climate warming. However, evaporation in the Arctic is still associated with large uncertainties. The Boisvert et al. (2013) moisture flux scheme (BMF13) is based on application of the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data, which produces high-quality, global, daily atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles even in the presence of clouds. Comparing the results of BMF13 against the ERA-Interim reanalysis, we found differences up to 55 W m-2 in the surface latent heat flux in the Beaufort-East Siberian Seas (BESS). We found out that the quality of the input data for the BMF13 and ERA-Interim flux schemes was the main cause for the differences. Differences in the input data sets cause moisture flux estimates to differ up to 1.6 \texttimes{} 10-2 g m-2 s-1 (40 W m-2 latent heat flux) in the BESS region, when both data sets were applied to the BMF13 scheme. Thus, the input data sets, AIRS version 6 and ERA-Interim reanalysis, were compared with a variety of in situ data. In skin temperature ERA-Interim had twice as large an error as AIRS version 6, but smaller errors in air specific humidity. The results suggested that AIRS data and the BMF13 scheme are a good option to estimate the moisture flux in the Arctic. However, the differences detected demonstrate a need for more in situ measurements of air temperature and humidity in the Arctic.},

  abstract = {Abstract Baroclinic waves drive both regional variations in weather and large-scale variability in the extratropical general circulation. They generally do not exist in isolation, but rather often form into coherent wave packets that propagate to the east via a mechanism called downstream development. Downstream development has been widely documented and explored. Here we document a novel but also key aspect of baroclinic waves: the downstream suppression of baroclinic activity that occurs in the wake of eastward propagating disturbances. Downstream suppression is apparent not only in the Southern Hemisphere storm track as shown in previous work, but also in the North Pacific and North Atlantic storm tracks. It plays an essential role in driving subseasonal periodicity in extratropical eddy activity in both hemispheres, and gives rise to the observed quiescence of the North Atlantic storm track 1\textendash 2 weeks following pronounced eddy activity in the North Pacific sector. It is argued that downstream suppression results from the anomalously low baroclinicity that arises as eastward propagating wave packets convert potential to kinetic energy. In contrast to baroclinic wave packets, which propagate to the east at roughly the group velocity in the upper troposphere, the suppression of baroclinic activity propagates eastward at a slower rate that is comparable to that of the lower to midtropospheric flow. The results have implications for understanding subseasonal variability in the extratropical troposphere of both hemispheres.},

Deep convection typically detrains a few kilometers below the tropopause, but the few storms that may reach up to the tropopause could have an outsize effect on water vapor, other chemically important trace species, and clouds. However, little progress has been made to quantify the role of these storms due to challenging conditions for observations, and computational limitations. Here we provide the first global observational estimate of the convective ice flux at near tropical tropopause levels by using spaceborne lidar measurements and pioneering a method to convert from lidar measurement to ice flux information. Our estimate indicates that the upward ice flux in deep convection dominates moisture transport almost all the way up to the cold point tropopause.},

Given zonal mean patterns of radiative forcing, radiative feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake, the MEBM accurately predicts zonal mean warming as simulated by general circulation models under increased CO2. Over a wide range of latitudes, the MEBM captures approximately 90\% of the variance in zonal mean warming across the general circulation models, with approximately 70\% of the variance attributable to differences in radiative feedbacks alone. Partitioning the radiative feedbacks into individual components shows that the majority of the uncertainty in the meridional pattern of warming arises from uncertainty in cloud feedbacks. Isolating feedback uncertainty within specific regions demonstrates that tropical feedback uncertainty leads to surface warming uncertainty that is global and nearly uniform with latitude, whereas polar feedback uncertainty leads to surface warming uncertainty that is largely confined to the poles.},

Southerly wind maxima appear on both morning and afternoon soundings but occur with much greater frequency, over a larger area, on the morning observations. Twenty-eight morning jet cases are used to determine average synoptic-scale wind and temperature patterns in the vicinity of the jet. Diurnal wind oscillations are examined by comparisons of jet frequencies, speeds, and altitudes on four-times-daily observations. The oscillation is similar to that described by Blackadar; however, there is no apparent tendency for the latitudinal variation in period of the oscillation which Blackadar's model implies.},

Climate sensitivity estimates depend critically on radiative feedbacks associated with water vapor, lapse rate, clouds, snow, and sea ice, and global estimates of these feedbacks differ among general circulation models. By reviewing recent observational, numerical, and theoretical studies, this paper shows that there has been progress since the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in (i) the understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in these feedbacks, (ii) the interpretation of intermodel differences in global estimates of these feedbacks, and (iii) the development of methodologies of evaluation of these feedbacks (or of some components) using observations.

In the tropics, temperature changes that occur on seasonal to decadal time scales are often associated with circulation changes. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the part of cloud variations that results from a change in the dynamics from the part that may result from the temperature change itself. This study proposes a simple framework to unravel the dynamic and non-dynamic (referred to as thermodynamic) components of the cloud response to climate variations. It is used to analyze the contrasted response, to a prescribed ocean warming, of the tropically-averaged cloud radiative forcing (CRF) simulated by the ECMWF, LMD and UKMO climate models. In each model, the dynamic component largely dominates the CRF response at the regional scale, but this is the thermodynamic component that explains most of the average CRF response to the imposed perturbation. It is shown that this component strongly depends on the behaviour of the low-level clouds that occur in regions of moderate subsidence (e.g. in the trade wind regions). These clouds exhibit a moderate sensitivity to temperature changes, but this is mostly their huge statistical weight that explains their large influence on the tropical radiation budget. Several propositions are made for assessing the sensitivity of clouds to changes in temperature and in large-scale motions using satellite observations and meteorological analyses on the one hand, and mesoscale models on the other hand.},

We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature).

  abstract = {This study analyzes the observed monthly deseasonalized and detrended variability of the tropical radiation budget and suggests that variations of the lower-tropospheric stability and of the spatial organization of deep convection both strongly contribute to this variability. Satellite observations show that on average over the tropical belt, when deep convection is more aggregated, the free troposphere is drier, the deep convective cloud coverage is less extensive, and the emission of heat to space is increased; an enhanced aggregation of deep convection is thus associated with a radiative cooling of the tropics. An increase of the tropical-mean lower-tropospheric stability is also coincident with a radiative cooling of the tropics, primarily because it is associated with more marine low clouds and an enhanced reflection of solar radiation, although the free-tropospheric drying also contributes to the cooling. The contributions of convective aggregation and lower-tropospheric stability to the modulation of the radiation budget are complementary, largely independent of each other, and equally strong. Together, they account for more than sixty percent of the variance of the tropical radiation budget. Satellite observations are thus consistent with the suggestion from modeling studies that the spatial organization of deep convection substantially influences the radiative balance of the Earth. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that control convective organization and lower-tropospheric stability variations, and the need to monitor their changes as the climate warms.},

Supergreenhouse effect (SGE) situations are found to be linked to the occurrence of enhanced large-scale rising motion associated with increasing SST. In regions where the large-scale atmospheric motion is largely decoupled from the local SST due to internal or remote forcings, the SGE occurrence is weak. On seasonal and interannual timescales, such regions are found mainly over equatorial regions of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific, especially for SSTs exceeding 29.5\textdegree C. In these regions, the activation of feedback processes that regulate the ocean temperature is thus likely to be more related to the large-scale remote processes, such as those that govern the monsoon circulations and the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere, than to the local SST change. The relationships among SST, clouds, and cloud radiative forcing inferred from satellite observations are also investigated. In large-scale subsidence regimes, regardless of the SST range, the cloudiness, the cloud optical thickness, and the shortwave cloud forcing decrease with increasing SST. In convective regions maintained by the large-scale circulation, the strong dependence of both the longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) cloud forcing on SST mainly results from changes in the large-scale vertical motion accompanying the SST changes. Indeed, for a given large-scale rising motion, the cloud optical thickness decreases with SST, and the SW cloud forcing remains essentially unaffected by SST changes. However, the LW cloud forcing still increases with SST because the detrainment height of deep convection, and thus the cloud-top altitude, tend to increase with SST. The dependence of the net cloud radiative forcing on SST may thus provide a larger positive climate feedback when the ocean warming is associated with weak large-scale circulation changes than during seasonal or El Ni\~no variations.},

  abstract = {General circulation models show that as the surface temperature increases, the convective anvil clouds shrink. By analyzing radiative\textendash convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but find themselves in a more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the anvil cloud fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the anvil cloud fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation.},

  abstract = {The annual intensification of the Somali jet, which accompanies the onset of the Indian summer monsoon, is rapid compared to the evolution of the seasonal insolation forcing. Using observationally-based data sets, the dynamic and thermodynamic changes accompanying the onset of this jet are presented. The abrupt component of jet onset is shown to occur over ocean about 1000km east of the East African highlands, and is accompanied by increases in both deep convection and baroclinic flow over the off-equatorial Arabian Sea. These abrupt changes are well separated from the core of the cross-equatorial jet, which is located over land adjacent to the East African highlands. The onset of the Somali jet and the associated monsoon are then examined in a convective quasi-equilibrium framework. Such a framework is consistent with the mean summer state, in that peak free-tropospheric temperatures are nearly collocated with peak subcloud layer entropies over the northern Bay of Bengal and adjacent coastal regions. Jet onset is accompanied by a large (\$\textbackslash hboxO\{100\textbackslash{} \textbackslash hboxW m\^-2\}\$) increase in surface enthalpy flux over the Arabian Sea that is nearly collocated with, and linearly related to, the concurrent increase in deep tropospheric ascent. At the same time, the highest subcloud entropies shift inland slightly from the Bay of Bengal, and the region of warmest free-tropospheric temperatures expands poleward. The consistency of all of these changes with a wind\textemdash evaporation feedback and several other hypothesized mechanisms of abrupt monsoon onset is discussed.

These quantitative theories can explain shifts in the zonal mean, but often have limited relevance for regional climate shifts, such as a period of enhanced precipitation over Saharan Africa during the mid-Holocene. Here we present a theory for regional tropical rainfall shifts that utilizes both zonal and meridional energy fluxes. We first identify a qualitative link between zonal and meridional energy fluxes and rainfall variations associated with the seasonal cycle and the El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation. We then develop a quantitative theory based on these fluxes that relates atmospheric energy transport to tropical rainfall. When applied to the orbital configuration of the mid-Holocene, our theory predicts continental rainfall shifts over Africa and Southeast Asia that are consistent with complex model simulations. However, the predicted rainfall over the Sahara is not sufficient to sustain vegetation at a level seen in the palaeo-record, which instead requires an additional large energy source such as that due to reductions in Saharan surface albedo. We thus conclude that additional feedbacks, such as those involving changes in vegetation or soil type, are required to explain changes in rainfall over Africa during the mid-Holocene.},

There is debate about whether those mountain ranges generate a strong monsoon by insulating the thermal maximum from cold and dry extratropical air or by providing a source of elevated heating. Here we show that the strength of the monsoon in a climate model is more sensitive to changes in surface heat fluxes from non-elevated parts of India than it is to changes in heat fluxes from adjacent elevated terrain. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that orography creates a strong monsoon by serving as a thermal insulator and suggests that monsoons respond most strongly to heat sources coincident with the thermal maximum.},

  abstract = {Abstract Here it is shown that almost all models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) exhibit a common bias in the thermodynamic structure of boreal summer monsoons. The strongest bias lies over South Asia, where the upper-tropospheric temperature maximum is too weak, is shifted southeast of its observed location, and does not extend as far west over Africa as it does in observations. Simulated Asian maxima of surface air moist static energy are also too weak and are located over coastal oceans rather than in their observed continental position. The spatial structure of this bias suggests that it is caused by an overly smoothed representation of topography west of the Tibetan Plateau, which allows dry air from the deserts of western Asia to penetrate the monsoon thermal maximum, suppressing moist convection and cooling the upper troposphere. In a climate model with a decent representation of the thermodynamic state of the Asian monsoon, the qualitative characteristics of this bias can be recreated by truncating topography just west of the Tibetan Plateau. This relatively minor topographic modification also produces a negative anomaly of Indian precipitation of similar sign and amplitude to the CMIP continental Indian monsoon precipitation bias. Furthermore, in simulations of next-century climate warming, this topographic modification reduces the amplitude of the increase in Indian monsoon precipitation. These results confirm the importance of topography west of the Tibetan Plateau for South Asian climate and illustrate the need for careful assessments of the thermodynamic state of model monsoons.},

In the annual mean, mixing transience had little effect on the meridional overturning. When mixing occurred on basin boundaries, the overturning strength was found to be insensitive to mixing transience. For mixing that was highly localized in space away from basin boundaries, oceanic meridional mass and heat transport decreased as mixing became more transient. The increased sensitivity in the highly localized case is likely due to the inhibition of surface heat flux into the thermocline. The dynamic response to transient mixing featured large-scale, internal oscillations that increased in amplitude with the transience of mixing but were confined to the Tropics and had little effect on the overturning cell through midlatitudes. These results indicate that transient diapycnal mixing, with a distribution suggestive of tropical cyclones, can effectively drive a meridional overturning.},

It is shown here that, for a moist atmosphere in convective quasi-equilibrium, the combination of wind-dependent ocean surface enthalpy fluxes and zonal momentum advection can provide a separate feedback that causes the meridional flow to evolve nonlinearly as a function of a sea surface temperature (SST) forcing, even if an angular momentum\textendash conserving response is not achieved. This wind\textendash evaporation feedback is examined in both an axisymmetric primitive equation model and a simple model that retains only a barotropic and single baroclinic mode. Only SST forcings that do not produce an angular momentum\textendash conserving response are examined here. The wind\textendash evaporation feedback is found to be inhibited in models with linear dynamics because the barotropic component of the Hadley circulation, which is coupled to the baroclinic circulation via surface drag, keeps surface winds small compared to upper-level winds. In models with nonlinear dynamics, the convergence of zonal momentum into the ascending branch of the cross-equatorial Hadley cell can create barotropic westerlies that constructively add to the baroclinic wind at the surface, thereby eliminating the inhibition of the wind\textendash evaporation feedback. The possible relevance of these results to the onset of monsoons is discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The effect of wind-induced surface heat exchange (WISHE) on axisymmetric, solstitial Hadley circulations is examined for forcings strong enough to produce meridional flow that nearly conserves absolute angular momentum in the free troposphere. Such forcings are known to produce an off-equatorial ascent zone in the summer hemisphere where the convergence of zonal momentum is balanced by drag on surface westerlies. Here, a convective quasi-equilibrium model with two vertical modes is used to show that enhanced surface entropy fluxes induced by these westerlies can intensify and shift both this ascent zone and the subcloud-layer entropy peak toward the equator. The equatorward shift of the subcloud entropy peak is associated with a reduction in the forcing amplitude needed to produce angular momentum\textendash conserving (AMC) meridional flow. A previous theory of frontogenesis in tropical cyclones is adapted to axisymmetric Hadley circulations to show how WISHE shifts the peak subcloud entropy toward the equator. These effects also occur for forcings that vary in a seasonal cycle, with the precise effect of WISHE depending on the peak amplitude of the forcing. For weak seasonally varying forcings, WISHE can abruptly increase the intensity of a local, viscous circulation, whereas for forcings of intermediate strength WISHE produces a transition to AMC flow when such a transition would not otherwise occur. For the strongest forcings, WISHE shifts the transition to AMC flow to a time earlier in the seasonal cycle. The possible relevance of these results to monsoon dynamics is discussed, as are possible effects of processes not represented in these axisymmetric models.},

The latitude {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{0} of maximum radiative-equilibrium temperature is progressively displaced off the equator or varied in time to study how the Hadley circulation responds to seasonally varying forcing; axisymmetric simulations are compared with eddy-permitting simulations. In axisymmetric steady-state simulations, the Hadley circulations for all {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{0} approach the nearly inviscid, angular-momentum-conserving limit, despite the presence of finite vertical diffusion of momentum and dry static energy. In contrast, in corresponding eddy-permitting simulations, the Hadley circulations undergo a regime transition as {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{0} is increased, from an equinox regime (small {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{0}) in which eddy momentum fluxes strongly influence both Hadley cells to a solstice regime (large {$<$}em{$>\phi<$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{0}) in which the cross-equatorial winter Hadley cell more closely approaches the angular-momentum-conserving limit. In axisymmetric time-dependent simulations, the Hadley cells undergo transitions between a linear equinox regime and a nonlinear, nearly angular-momentum-conserving solstice regime. Unlike in the eddy-permitting simulations, time tendencies of the zonal wind play a role in the dynamics of the transitions in the axisymmetric simulation. Nonetheless, the axisymmetric transitions are similar to those in the eddy-permitting simulations in that the role of the nonlinear mean momentum flux divergence in the zonal momentum budget shifts from marginal in the equinox regime to dominant in the solstice regime. As in the eddy-permitting simulations, a mean-flow feedback\textemdash involving the upper-level zonal winds, the lower-level temperature gradient, and the poleward boundary of the cross-equatorial Hadley cell\textemdash makes it possible for the circulation fields to change at the transition more rapidly than can be explained by the steady-state response to the thermal forcing.

While some modelled quantities respond almost immediately to the atmospheric CO2 concentrations, others exhibit a time lag relative to the change in CO2. Most quantities also exhibit a lag relative to the global-mean surface temperature change, which can be described as a hysteresis behaviour. The most surprising responses are from low-level clouds and ocean stratification in the Southern Ocean, which both exhibit hysteresis on timescales longer than expected. We see no evidence of critical thresholds in these simulations, although some of the hysteresis phenomena become more apparent above 2 \texttimes{} CO2 or 3 \texttimes{} CO2.

  abstract = {Abstract During the last century, global climate has been warming, and projections indicate that such a warming is likely to continue over coming decades. Most of the extra heat is stored in the ocean, resulting in thermal expansion of seawater and global mean sea level rise. Previous studies have shown that after CO2 emissions cease or CO2 concentration is stabilized, global mean surface air temperature stabilizes or decreases slowly, but sea level continues to rise. Using idealized CO2 scenario simulations with a hierarchy of models including an AOGCM and a step-response model, the authors show how the evolution of thermal expansion can be interpreted in terms of the climate energy balance and the vertical profile of ocean warming. Whereas surface temperature depends on cumulative CO2 emissions, sea level rise due to thermal expansion depends on the time profile of emissions. Sea level rise is smaller for later emissions, implying that targets to limit sea level rise would need to refer to the rate of emissions, not only to the time integral. Thermal expansion is in principle reversible, but to halt or reverse it quickly requires the radiative forcing to be reduced substantially, which is possible on centennial time scales only by geoengineering. If it could be done, the results indicate that heat would leave the ocean more readily than it entered, but even if thermal expansion were returned to zero, the geographical pattern of sea level would be altered. Therefore, despite any aggressive CO2 mitigation, regional sea level change is inevitable.},

  abstract = {Abstract Results are presented from the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), simulation of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) at the standard 1\textdegree{} resolution, the same resolution as the majority of the CCSM4 CMIP5 long-term simulations for the historical and future projection scenarios. The forcings and boundary conditions for this simulation follow the protocols of the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project, version 3 (PMIP3). Two additional CCSM4 CO2 sensitivity simulations, in which the concentrations are abruptly changed at the start of the simulation to the low 185 ppm LGM concentrations (LGMCO2) and to a quadrupling of the preindustrial concentration (4\texttimes CO2), are also analyzed. For the full LGM simulation, the estimated equilibrium cooling of the global mean annual surface temperature is 5.5\textdegree C with an estimated radiative forcing of -6.2 W m-2. The radiative forcing includes the effects of the reduced LGM greenhouse gases, ice sheets, continental distribution with sea level lowered by approximately 120 m from the present, and orbital parameters, but not changes to atmospheric aerosols or vegetation biogeography. The LGM simulation has an equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) of 3.1({$\pm$}0.3)\textdegree C, comparable to the CCSM4 4\texttimes CO2 result. The LGMCO2 simulation shows a greater ECS of 4.2\textdegree C. Other responses found at the LGM in CCSM4 include a global precipitation rate decrease at a rate of \textasciitilde 2\% \textdegree C-1, similar to climate change simulations in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4); a strengthening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) with a shoaling of North Atlantic Deep Water and a filling of the deep basin up to sill depth with Antarctic Bottom Water; and an enhanced seasonal cycle accompanied by reduced ENSO variability in the eastern Pacific Ocean's SSTs.},

  abstract = {Abstract The nonlinear development of baroclinically unstable waves in the presence of surface friction and heat flux is studied, using a global primitive equation model. The experiments use zonal wavenumber 3.7 or 12 and a variety of initial conditions, mostly representative of observed initial states. Other initial states consist of solidbody rotation with vertical shear of the zonal wind. In addition to comparisons of inviscid and dissipative experiments, the effect of linear and nonlinear drag formulations is compared. Starting from a small-amplitude perturbation in the temperature field, a modal structure emerges and grows exponentially for a few days. Unstable waves assume a structure that reduces frictional energy IOU when surface drag is present, but they still retain a normal mode character during a period of rapid growth. As the wave grows in amplitude, the ratio of upper-level to low-level eddy kinetic energy increases substantially in the presence of nonlinear surface drag. In the absence of surface drag or in the presence of linear drag the waves experience less structural change. Surface processes reduce the maximum amplitude achieved by the wave and damp the slowly growing wavenumber-3 and shallow wavenumber-12 disturbances more effectively than the rapidly growing, deep wavenumber 7.In the mature wave, surface momentum drag and heat flux suppress eddy velocity and temperature fields near the surface, causing the meridional heat flux to peak at about 800 mb rather than near the surface as itdoes when surface fluxes are excluded. When surface fluxes are present, the structures of mature waves resemble observations more closely than when the fluxes are absent. When initial conditions are similar to those used by Simmons and Hoskins, the Eliassen-Palm flux produced by the mature wave tends to converge in the upper troposphere, primarily as the result of the vertical gradient in poleward heat flux. However, the convergence is sensitive to initial conditions and is spread more broadly through the troposphere for other configurations of the initial state.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric transient eddies contribute significantly to mid-latitude energy and water vapor transports. Changes in the global climate, as induced by greenhouse enhancement, will likely alter transient eddy behavior. Unraveling all the feedbacks that occur in general circulation models (GCMs) can be difficult. Here, we isolate the transient eddies from the feedbacks and focus on the response of the eddies to simulated zonal-mean climate change that results from CO2-doubling. Using a primitive-equation spectral model, we examine the impact of such climate change on the life cycles of transient eddies. We compare transient eddy behavior in experiments with initial conditions that are given by the zonal-mean climates of GCMs with current and doubled amounts of CO2. The smaller meridional temperature gradient in a doubled CO2 climate leads to a reduction in eddy kinetic energy, especially in the subtropics. The decrease in subtropical eddy energy is related to a substantial reduction in equatorward flux of eddy activity during the latter part of the life cycle. The reduction in equatorward energy flux alters the moisture cycle. Eddy meridional transport of water vapor is shifted slightly poleward and subtropical precipitation is reduced. The water vapor transport exhibits a relatively small change in magnitude, compared to changes in eddy energy, due to the compensating effect of higher specific humidity in the doubled-CO2 climate. An increase in high-latitude precipitation is related to the poleward shift in eddy water vapor flux. Our experiments indicate that the simulation of climate change in eddy water vapor transport and eddy-generated precipitation is sensitive to model resolution and requires a minimum truncation of rhomboidal 30 in a spectral model. Surface evaporation amplifies climatic changes in water vapor transport and precipitation in our experiments.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding and predicting changes in storm tracks over longer time scales is a challenging problem, particularly in the North Atlantic. This is due in part to the complex range of forcings (land\textendash sea contrast, orography, sea surface temperatures, etc.) that combine to produce the structure of the storm track. The impact of land\textendash sea contrast and midlatitude orography on the North Atlantic storm track is investigated through a hierarchy of GCM simulations using idealized and ``semirealistic'' boundary conditions in a high-resolution version of the Hadley Centre atmosphere model (HadAM3). This framework captures the large-scale essence of features such as the North and South American continents, Eurasia, and the Rocky Mountains, enabling the results to be applied more directly to realistic modeling situations than was possible with previous idealized studies. The physical processes by which the forcing mechanisms impact the large-scale flow and the midlatitude storm tracks are discussed. The characteristics of the North American continent are found to be very important in generating the structure of the North Atlantic storm track. In particular, the southwest\textendash northeast tilt in the upper tropospheric jet produced by southward deflection of the westerly flow incident on the Rocky Mountains leads to enhanced storm development along an axis close to that of the continent's eastern coastline. The approximately triangular shape of North America also enables a cold pool of air to develop in the northeast, intensifying the surface temperature contrast across the eastern coastline, consistent with further enhancements of baroclinicity and storm growth along the same axis.},

This framework enables the mechanisms determining the tropospheric response to North Atlantic SST patterns to be examined, both in isolation and in combination with continental-scale landmasses and orography. In isolation, a ``Gulf Stream'' SST pattern acts to strengthen the downstream storm track while a ``North Atlantic Drift'' SST pattern weakens it. These changes are consistent with changes in the extratropical SST gradient and near-surface baroclinicity, and each storm-track response is associated with a consistent change in the tropospheric jet structure. Locally enhanced near-surface horizontal wind convergence is found over the warm side of strengthened SST gradients associated with ascending air and increased precipitation, consistent with previous studies. When the combined SST pattern is introduced into the semirealistic framework (including the ``North American'' continent and the ``Rocky Mountains''), the results suggest that the topographically generated southwest\textendash northeast tilt in the North Atlantic storm track is enhanced. In particular, the Gulf Stream shifts the storm track south in the western Atlantic whereas the strong high-latitude SST gradient in the northeastern Atlantic enhances the storm track there.},

Model integrations show that increases in the midlatitude SST gradient generally lead to stronger storm tracks that are shifted slightly poleward, consistent with changes in the lower-tropospheric baroclinicity. The large-scale atmospheric response is, however, highly sensitive to the position of the SST gradient anomaly relative to that of the subtropical jet in the unperturbed atmosphere. In particular, when SST gradients are increased very close to the subtropical jet, then the Hadley cell and subtropical jet is strengthened while the storm track and eddy-driven jet are shifted equatorward. Conversely, if the subtropical SST gradients are reduced and the midlatitude gradients increased, then the storm track shows a strong poleward shift and a well-separated eddy-driven jet is produced. The sign of the SST anomaly is shown to play a secondary role in determining the overall tropospheric response. These findings are used to provide a new and consistent interpretation of some previous GCM studies concerning the atmospheric response to midlatitude SST anomalies.},

The strength of the boreal winter North Atlantic storm track is significantly increased and penetrates much farther into western Europe. The changes in the storm track are shown to be consistent with the changes in near-surface baroclinicity, which can be linked to changes in surface temperature gradients near regions of sea ice formation and in the open ocean. Changes in the SST of the tropical Atlantic are linked to a strengthening of the subtropical jet to the north, which, combined with the enhanced storm track, leads to a pronounced split in the jet structure over Europe. EOF analysis and stationary box indices methods are used to analyze changes to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). There is no consistent signal of a change in the variability of the NAO, and while the changes in the mean flow project onto the positive NAO phase, they are significantly different from it. However, there is a clear eastward shift of the NAO pattern in the shutdown run, and this potentially has implications for ocean circulation and for the interpretation of proxy paleoclimate records.},

We explore this role in a two-dimensional numerical experiment on a simple moist convecting system consisting of an isolated long-lasting nonprecipitating cloud in a calm atmosphere with no surface forcing. The cloud develops a horizontally averaged density variation with height which is neutrally buoyant with respect to a moist adiabatic. The buoyancy difference between the cloud and the undisturbed sounding produces circulations that can be understood as spreading gravity waves which adjust the environmental buoyancy to be equal to the cloud buoyancy by compensating subsidence. Unlike the circulations inside clouds, this adjustment takes place without turbulent mixing. Hence, the ``buoyancy adjustment time'' T1 during which the environment comes into rough buoyant equilibrium with the clouds is much shorter than the ``mixing time'' T2 which it takes a tracer, initially concentrated at some level, to become homogenized through the layer in a field of clouds. Associated with this gravity wave response are circulations which cause the preferential detrainment of ``cloud-processed'' air at heights at which the buoyancy of clouds relative to their far environment is decreasing with height. We confirmed these ideas in less idealized numerical experiments in which different soundings, precipitation, and surface heat fluxes were included.},

Low-latitude boundary-layer and cumulus cloud regimes are particularly problematic, because they are sustained by tight interactions between clouds and unresolved turbulent circulations. Turbulence-resolving models better simulate such cloud regimes and support the GCM consensus that they contribute to positive global cloud feedbacks. Large-eddy simulations using sub-100\,m grid spacings over small computational domains elucidate marine boundary-layer cloud response to greenhouse warming. Four observationally supported mechanisms contribute: `thermodynamic' cloudiness reduction from warming of the atmosphere\textendash ocean column, `radiative' cloudiness reduction from CO2- and H2O-induced increase in atmospheric emissivity aloft, `stability-induced' cloud increase from increased lower tropospheric stratification, and `dynamical' cloudiness increase from reduced subsidence. The cloudiness reduction mechanisms typically dominate, giving positive shortwave cloud feedback. Cloud-resolving models with horizontal grid spacings of a few kilometres illuminate how cumulonimbus cloud systems affect climate feedbacks. Limited-area simulations and superparameterized GCMs show upward shift and slight reduction of cloud cover in a warmer climate, implying positive cloud feedbacks. A global cloud-resolving model suggests tropical cirrus increases in a warmer climate, producing positive longwave cloud feedback, but results are sensitive to subgrid turbulence and ice microphysics schemes.},

It is derived from Grenier and Bretherton but has been heavily modified to improve its numerical stability and efficiency with the long time steps used in climate models. A goal was to provide a more physically realistic treatment of marine stratocumulus-topped boundary layers than in the current CAM. Key features of the scheme include use of moist-conserved variables, an explicit entrainment closure for convective layers, diagnosis of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) for computation of turbulent diffusivities, an efficient new formulation of TKE transport as a relaxation to layer-mean TKE, and unified treatment of all turbulent layers in each atmospheric column. The scheme is compared with the default turbulence parameterizations in the CAM using three single-column modeling cases, using both operational and high vertical and time resolution. Both schemes performed comparably well on the dry convective boundary layer case. For a stable boundary layer case, the default CAM overdeepens the boundary layer unless its free-tropospheric mixing length is greatly reduced, whereupon the new scheme and default CAM again both perform well at both tested resolutions. A nocturnal stratocumulus case was much better simulated by the new scheme than the default CAM, with much less resolution sensitivity. Global climate simulations with the new scheme in tandem with a new shallow cumulus parameterization are presented in a companion paper.},

  abstract = {Information is now available regarding the vertical distribution of water vapour and helium in the lower stratosphere over southern England. The helium content of the air is found to be remarkably constant up to 20 km but the water content is found to fall very rapidly just above the tropopause, and in the lowest 1 km of the stratosphere the humidity mixing ratio falls through a ratio of 10\textemdash 1. The helium distribution is not compatible with the view of a quiescent stratosphere free from turbulence or vertical motions. The water-vapour distribution is incompatible with a turbulent stratosphere unless some dynamic process maintains the dryness of the stratosphere. In view of the large wind shear which is normally found just above the tropopause it is unlikely that this region is free from turbulence. The observed distributions can be explained by the existence of a circulation in which air enters the stratosphere at the equator, where it is dried by condensation, travels in the stratosphere to temperate and polar regions, and sinks into the troposphere. The sinking, however, will warm the air unless it is being cooled by radiation and the idea of a stratosphere in radiative equilibrium must be abandoned. The cooling rate must lie between about 0.1 and 1.1\textdegree C per day but a value near 0.5\textdegree C per day seems most probable. At the equator the ascending air must be subject to heating by radiation. The circulation is quite reasonable on energy considerations. It is consistent with the existence of lower temperatures in the equatorial stratosphere than in polar and temperate regions, and if the flow can carry ozone from the equator to the poles then it gives a reasonable explanation of the high ozone values observed at high latitudes. The dynamic consequences of the circulation are not considered. It should however be noted that there is considerable difficulty to account for the smallness of the westerly winds in the stratosphere, as the rotation of the earth should convert the slow poleward movement into strong westerly winds.},

  abstract = {Abstract Present-day Arctic and Antarctic climate of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) is presented. The CCM3 simulation is from a prescribed and interannually varying sea surface temperature integration from January 1979 through August 1993. Observations from a variety of sources, including the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses, rawinsonde, and surface station data, are used for validation of CCM3's polar climate during this period. Overall, CCM3 can simulate many important polar climatic features and in general is an incremental improvement over CCM2. The 500-hPa polar vortex minima are too deep by 50\textendash 100 m and too zonally symmetric. The Arctic sea level pressure maximum is displaced poleward, while the Icelandic region minimum is extended toward Europe, and the Aleutian region minimum is extended toward Asia. The Antarctic circumpolar trough of low sea level pressure is slightly north of the observed position and is 2\textendash 3 hPa too low. Antarctic katabatic winds are similar to observations in magnitude and regional variation. The Antarctic surface wind stress is estimated to be 30\%\textendash 50\% too strong in some regions. Polar tropospheric temperatures are 2\textdegree\textendash 4\textdegree C colder than observations, mostly in the summer season. Low-level winter inversions over the Arctic Ocean are only 3\textdegree\textendash 4\textdegree C, rather than the observed 10\textdegree C. In the Antarctic midcontinent they are around 25\textdegree\textendash 30\textdegree C (about 5\textdegree{} stronger than observed) and continue to be stronger than observed along the coast. Although water vapor column is uniformly low by 10\%\textendash 20\% compared to analyses in both polar regions, the regional patterns of minima over Greenland and the East Antarctic plateau are well represented. Annual 70\textdegree{} to pole CCM3 values are 5.8 kg m-2 for the Arctic and 1.7 kg m-2 for the Antarctic. The regional distribution of precipitation minus evaporation compares reasonably with analyses. The annual 70\textdegree{} to pole values are 18.1 cm yr-1, which are close to the most recent observational estimates of 16 to 18 cm yr-1 in the Arctic and 18.4 {$\pm$} 3.7 cm yr-1 in the Antarctic. In both polar regions, summer surface energy budgets are estimated to be low by roughly 20 W m-2. Suggestions as to causes of simulation deficiencies are 1) polar heat sinks that are too strong; 2) inadequate representation of sea-ice\textendash atmosphere heat exchange, due to lack of fractional coverage of sea ice of variable thickness; 3) effects of low horizontal resolution; and 4) biased extrapolar influence.},

By analyzing the behaviour of low-level clouds in a hierarchy of models (coupled ocean-atmosphere model, atmospheric general circulation model, aqua-planet model, single-column model) using the same physical parameterizations, this study proposes an interpretation of the strong positive low-cloud feedback predicted by the IPSL-CM5A climate model under climate change. In a warmer climate, the model predicts an enhanced clear-sky radiative cooling, stronger surface turbulent fluxes, a deepening and a drying of the planetary boundary layer, and a decrease of tropical low-clouds in regimes of weak subsidence. We show that the decrease of low-level clouds critically depends on the change in the vertical advection of moist static energy from the free troposphere to the boundary-layer. This change is dominated by variations in the vertical gradient of moist static energy between the surface and the free troposphere just above the boundary-layer. In a warmer climate, the thermodynamical relationship of Clausius-Clapeyron increases this vertical gradient, and then the import by large-scale subsidence of low moist static energy and dry air into the boundary layer. This results in a decrease of the low-level cloudiness and in a weakening of the radiative cooling of the boundary layer by low-level clouds. The energetic framework proposed in this study might help to interpret inter-model differences in low-cloud feedbacks under climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract The role of mountains in maintaining extensive midlatitude arid regions in the Northern Hemisphere was investigated using simulations from the GFDL Global Climate Model with and without orography. In the integration with mountains, dry climates were simulated over central Asia and the interior of North America, in good agreement with the observed climate. In contrast, moist climates were simulated in the same regions in the integration without mountains. During all season but summer, large amplitude stationary waves occur in response to the Tibetan Plateau and Rocky Mountains. The midlatitude dry regions are located upstream of the troughs of these waves, where general subsidence and relatively infrequent storm development occur and precipitation is thus inhibited. In summer, this mechanism contributes to the dryness of interior North America as a stationary wave trough remains east of the Rockies, but is not effective in Eurasia due to seasonal changes in the atmospheric circulation. The dryness of interior Eurasia in summer results, in part, from the south Asian monsoon circulation induced by the Tibetan Plateau. Its rising branch is centered above the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and its salient features are a cyclonic flow at low levels (the ``south Asian low'') and an anticyclonic flow in the upper troposphere. This circulation is associated with a northward displacement of the storm track and a flow of relatively dry, subsiding air across much of central Asia. In addition, land surface\textendash atmosphere feedback contributes to the dryness of all midlatitude dry regions. Although the effect of this feedback is small in winter, it is responsible for more than half of the reduction in summer precipitation. Orography also substantially reduces the moisture transport across the continental interiors. The results from this experiment suggest that midlatitude dryness is largely due to the existence of orography. This is an alternative to the traditional explanation that distance from oceanic moisture sources, accentuated locally by the presence of mountain barriers upwind, is the major cause of midlatitude dry regions. Paleoclimatic evidence of less aridity during the late Tertiary, before substantial uplift of the Rocky Mountains and Tibetan Plateau is believed to have occurred, supports this possibility.},

However, the driving forces of these changes remain controversial. A major obstacle to progress is the uncertainty over the role played by greenhouse gas radiative forcing. Here we present boron isotope compositions for planktic foraminifera, which record carbon dioxide change for the interval of most rapid cooling, the late Miocene cooling event between 7 and 5\,Ma. Our record suggests that CO2 declined by some 100\,ppm over this two-million-year-long interval to a minimum at approximately 5.9\,Ma. Having accounted for non-CO2 greenhouse gasses and slow climate feedbacks, we estimate global mean surface temperature change for a doubling of CO2\textemdash equilibrium climate sensitivity\textemdash to be 3.9\,\textdegree C (1.8\textendash 6.7\,\textdegree C at 95\% confidence) on the basis of comparison of our record of radiative forcing from CO2 with a record of global mean surface temperature change. We conclude that changes in CO2 and climate were closely coupled during the latest Miocene and that equilibrium climate sensitivity was within range of estimates for the late Pleistocene, other intervals of the Cenozoic and the twenty-first century as presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.},

Time series of several daily climate indices\textemdash including Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific\textendash North American (PNA) pattern, east/west Pacific Oscillation (EPO/WPO), and both raw and detrended Gulf of Mexico SST anomalies (SSTA/SSTAD)\textemdash are collected in advance of Southeast severe convective days and grouped using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Spatiotemporal distributions of storm reports within nodes are compared to seasonal climatology, and the evolution of the regional environment for nodes associated with outbreaks is analyzed to provide physical justification for such associations. This study confirms findings from several tornado-related climate studies in the literature, while also identifying a number of new patterns associated with Southeast tornado outbreaks. Both the AO and NAO are relevant across all seasons, especially on lead time scales of 1\textendash 2 months, while SSTA/SSTADs are relevant on smaller time scales. The physical connection between these patterns and the regional storm environment is largely related to alterations of upper-level circulation and jet stream patterns, which in turn influence deep- and low-level shear, inland transport of moisture and instability, and other regional characteristics pertinent to tornado outbreaks. These results suggest that climate-scale variability can modulate and potentially be used to predict regional storm environments and their likelihood to produce tornado outbreaks across the Southeast.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quasi-equilibrium convective parameterizations share the common assumption that in regions of sustained deep convection rates of change in convective available potential energy (CAPE) are small compared to the magnitude of the large-scale and boundary layer forcings that act to modify CAPE. The more restrictive strict quasi-equilibrium hypothesis (SQE) is that changes in CAPE are dynamically negligible. Under this assumption, tropospheric temperature and thickness variations largely follow a moist adiabat associated with variations in the boundary layer \texttheta e. SQE is an attractive simplification for theories of large-scale circulation in the Tropics but has been inadequately tested to date. In this paper, we test the SQE hypothesis over convecting regions of the tropical oceans using microwave sounding unit tropospheric temperature and precipitation fields, along with COADS surface data, on timescales of a month and longer and on space scales ranging upward from O(300 km). One prediction of SQE, that \texttheta e and vertically averaged temperature ({$\langle$}T\,{$\rangle$}) are positively correlated in space and time, is found to hold for month-to-month, seasonal, and interannual timescales, but the proportionality coefficient between {$\langle$}T\,{$\rangle$} and \texttheta e is at most half as large as predicted. This is associated with variations of mean CAPE of as much as 25\% over even the largest time and space scales examined.},

The analysis reveals a statistically significant decrease of number of blocking events over the period of ERA-40.Winters with an increased number of blocking events are associated with negative temperature anomalies over Central to Eastern Europe and dryer conditions, whereas Southern Europe experiences warmer and wetter conditions during such episodes. Using extreme value statistics we show evidence that cold spells, and to some extent dry spells, are strongly associated with extremes in blocking frequency. The number of cold spell days increases with the duration of blocking events indicating that cold spells need time to establish during blocking events, thus return periods of cold spells are longer than those for blocking events. This behaviour is not found for the relation of dry spells with blocking events. Still, blocking episodes have a higher occurrence of dry spells than climatology.},

This causes the surface air temperature to approach the temperature of the relatively warm ocean water below the ice. The resulting increases in air temperature, water vapor, and cloudiness lead to an increase in the surface downwelling longwave radiation (DLR), which enables a further thinning of the ice. This positive ice\textendash insulation feedback operates mainly in the autumn and winter. A climate change simulation with the Community Earth System Model shows that, averaged over the year, the increase in Arctic DLR is 3 times stronger than the increase in Arctic absorbed solar radiation at the surface. The warming of the surface air over the Arctic Ocean during fall and winter creates a strong thermal contrast with the colder surrounding continents. Sea level pressure falls over the Arctic Ocean, and the high-latitude circulation reorganizes into a shallow ``winter monsoon.'' The resulting increase in surface wind speed promotes stronger surface evaporation and higher humidity over portions of the Arctic Ocean, thus reinforcing the ice\textendash insulation feedback.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In this study, we use recent advances in the parameterization of air-sea oxygen fluxes to analyze 9 years of oxygen data from a recalibrated Argo oxygen data set and from air-calibrated oxygen floats deployed as part of the Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM) project. From this combined data set of 150 floats, we find a total Southern Ocean oxygen sink of -183 {$\pm$} 80 Tmol yr-1 (positive to the atmosphere), greater than prior estimates. The uptake occurs primarily in the Polar-Frontal Antarctic Zone (PAZ, -94 {$\pm$} 30 Tmol O2 yr-1) and Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ, -111 {$\pm$} 9.3 Tmol O2 yr-1). This flux is driven by wintertime ventilation, with a large portion of the flux in the SIZ passing through regions with fractional sea ice. The Subtropical Zone (STZ) is seasonally driven by thermal fluxes and exhibits a net outgassing of 47 {$\pm$} 29 Tmol O2 yr-1 that is likely driven by biological production. The Subantarctic Zone (SAZ) uptake is -25 {$\pm$} 12 Tmol O2 yr-1. Total oxygen fluxes were separated into a thermal and nonthermal component. The nonthermal flux is correlated with net primary production and mixed layer depth in the STZ, SAZ, and PAZ, but not in the SIZ where seasonal sea ice slows the air-sea gas flux response to the entrainment of deep, low-oxygen waters.},

  abstract = {Abstract The steady-state extratropical atmospheric response to thermal forcing is investigated in a simple atmospheric general circulation model. The thermal forcings qualitatively mimic three key aspects of anthropogenic climate change: warming in the tropical troposphere, cooling in the polar stratosphere, and warming at the polar surface. The principal novel findings are the following: 1) Warming in the tropical troposphere drives two robust responses in the model extratropical circulation: poleward shifts in the extratropical tropospheric storm tracks and a weakened stratospheric Brewer\textendash Dobson circulation. The former result suggests heating in the tropical troposphere plays a fundamental role in the poleward contraction of the storm tracks found in Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-class climate change simulations; the latter result is in the opposite sense of the trends in the Brewer\textendash Dobson circulation found in most previous climate change experiments. 2) Cooling in the polar stratosphere also drives a poleward shift in the extratropical storm tracks. The tropospheric response is largely consistent with that found in previous studies, but it is shown to be very sensitive to the level and depth of the forcing. In the stratosphere, the Brewer\textendash Dobson circulation weakens at midlatitudes, but it strengthens at high latitudes because of anomalously poleward heat fluxes on the flank of the polar vortex. 3) Warming at the polar surface drives an equatorward shift of the storm tracks. The storm-track response to polar warming is in the opposite sense of the response to tropical tropospheric heating; hence large warming over the Arctic may act to attenuate the response of the Northern Hemisphere storm track to tropical heating. 4) The signs of the tropospheric and stratospheric responses to all thermal forcings considered here are robust to seasonal changes in the basic state, but the amplitude and details of the responses exhibit noticeable differences between equinoctial and wintertime conditions. Additionally, the responses exhibit marked nonlinearity in the sense that the response to multiple thermal forcings applied simultaneously is quantitatively different from the sum of the responses to the same forcings applied independently. Thus the response of the model to a given thermal forcing is demonstrably dependent on the other thermal forcings applied to the model.},

Warming of extreme temperatures is amplified over land, with severe implications for human health, wildfire risk and food production. Using simulations from 18 climate models, I show that hot days over tropical land warm substantially more than the average day. For example, warming of the hottest 5\% of land days is a factor of 1.21\,{$\pm$}\,0.07 larger than the time-mean warming averaged across models. The climate change response of extreme temperatures over tropical land is interpreted using a theory based on atmospheric dynamics. According to the theory, warming is amplified for hot land days because those days are dry, which is termed the `drier get hotter' mechanism. Changes in near-surface relative humidity further increase tropical land warming, with decreases in land relative humidity being particularly important. The theory advances physical understanding of the tropical climate and highlights land surface dryness as a key factor determining how extreme temperatures respond to climate change.},

It has been suggested that global climate sensitivity also depends on the circulation response, an effect called the ``atmospheric dynamics feedback.'' Using a technique to isolate the influence of changes in atmospheric circulation on top-of-the-atmosphere radiation, the authors calculate the atmospheric dynamics feedback in coupled climate models. Large-scale circulation changes contribute substantially to all-sky and cloud feedbacks in the tropics but are relatively less important at higher latitudes. Globally averaged, the atmospheric dynamics feedback is positive and amplifies the near-surface temperature response to climate change by an average of 8\% in simulations with coupled models. A constraint related to the atmospheric mass budget results in the dynamics feedback being small on large scales relative to feedbacks associated with thermodynamic processes. Idealized-forcing simulations suggest that circulation changes at high latitudes are potentially more effective at influencing global temperature than circulation changes at low latitudes, and the implications for past and future climate change are discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The width of the ITCZ, however, has received little attention despite its importance for regional climate and for understanding the general circulation of the atmosphere. This paper investigates the ITCZ width in simulations with an idealized general circulation model over a wide range of climates. The ITCZ, defined as the tropical region where there is time-mean ascent, displays rich behavior as the climate varies, widening with warming in cool climates, narrowing in temperate climates, and maintaining a relatively constant width in hot climates. The mass and energy budgets of the Hadley circulation are used to derive expressions for the area of the ITCZ relative to the area of the neighboring descent region, and for the sensitivity of the ITCZ area to changes in climate. The ITCZ width depends primarily on four quantities: the net energy input to the tropical atmosphere, the advection of moist static energy by the Hadley circulation, the transport of moist static energy by transient eddies, and the gross moist stability. Different processes are important for the ITCZ width in different climates, with changes in gross moist stability generally having a weak influence relative to the other processes. The results are likely to be useful for analyzing the ITCZ width in complex climate models and for understanding past and future climate change in the tropics.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

MSE advection by the mean circulation and MSE divergence by transient eddies tend to narrow the ITCZ, while changes in net energy input to the atmosphere and the gross moist stability tend to widen the ITCZ. The narrowing tendency arises because the meridional MSE gradient strengthens with warming, whereas the largest widening tendency is due to increasing shortwave heating of the atmosphere.

Here the radiative effects controlling an axisymmetric monsoon and its response to climate change are investigated using aquaplanet simulations. The influences of clouds, water vapor, and CO\textsubscript{2} on the axisymmetric monsoon are decomposed using the radiation-locking technique. Seasonal variations in clouds and water vapor strongly modulate the axisymmetric monsoon, reducing net precipitation by approximately half. Warming and moistening of the axisymmetric monsoon by seasonal longwave cloud and water vapor effects are counteracted by a strong shortwave cloud effect. The shortwave cloud effect also expedites onset of the axisymmetric monsoon by approximately two weeks, whereas longwave cloud and water vapor effects delay onset. A conceptual model relates the timing of monsoon onset to the efficiency of surface cooling. In climate change simulations CO\textsubscript{2} forcing and the water vapor feedback have similar influences on the axisymmetric monsoon, warming the surface and moistening the region. In contrast, clouds have a negligible effect on surface temperature yet dominate the monsoon circulation response. A new perspective for understanding how cloud radiative effects shape the monsoon circulation response to climate change is introduced. The radiation-locking simulations and analyses advance understanding of how radiative processes influence an axisymmetric monsoon, and establish a framework for interpreting monsoon\textendash radiation coupling in observations, in state-of-the-art models, and in different climate states.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The changes over ocean broadly follow a simple thermodynamic scaling of the atmospheric moisture convergence: the so-called ``wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier'' mechanism.

  abstract = {In recent decades, the land surface has warmed substantially more than the ocean surface, and relative humidity has fallen over land. Amplified warming and declining relative humidity over land are also dominant features of future climate projections, with implications for climate-change impacts. An emerging body of research has shown how constraints from atmospheric dynamics and moisture budgets are important for projected future land\textendash ocean contrasts, but these ideas have not been used to investigate temperature and humidity records over recent decades. Here we show how both the temperature and humidity changes observed over land between 1979 and 2016 are linked to warming over neighboring oceans. A simple analytical theory, based on atmospheric dynamics and moisture transport, predicts equal changes in moist static energy over land and ocean and equal fractional changes in specific humidity over land and ocean. The theory is shown to be consistent with the observed trends in land temperature and humidity given the warming over ocean. Amplified land warming is needed for the increase in moist static energy over drier land to match that over ocean, and land relative humidity decreases because land specific humidity is linked via moisture transport to the weaker warming over ocean. However, there is considerable variability about the best-fit trend in land relative humidity that requires further investigation and which may be related to factors such as changes in atmospheric circulations and land-surface properties.},

Surface energy balance arguments have been used to understand the response over ocean but are difficult to apply over more complex land surfaces. Here, a conceptual box model is introduced, involving atmospheric moisture transport between the land and ocean and surface evapotranspiration, to investigate the decreases in land relative humidity as the climate warms. The box model is applied to simulations with idealized and full-complexity (CMIP5) general circulation models, and it is found to capture many of the features of the simulated changes in land humidity. The simplest version of the box model gives equal fractional increases in specific humidity over land and ocean. This relationship implies a decrease in land relative humidity given the greater warming over land than ocean and modest changes in ocean relative humidity, consistent with a mechanism proposed previously. When evapotranspiration is included, it is found to be of secondary importance compared to ocean moisture transport for the increase in land specific humidity, but it plays an important role for the decrease in land relative humidity. For the case of a moisture forcing over land, such as from stomatal closure, the response of land relative humidity is strongly amplified by the induced change in land surface\textendash air temperature, and this amplification is quantified using a theory for the link between land and ocean temperatures.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

We find that poleward heat transport increases with surface temperature over much of this range, but saturates in the low-gradient, high-temperature regime where it is most needed. We identify some specific dynamical feedbacks responsible for this behavior: increasing tropospheric static stability and poleward migration of the storm tracks as global-mean temperature increases.},

  abstract = {Projections of future climate depend critically on refined estimates of climate sensitivity. Recent progress in temperature proxies dramatically increases the magnitude of warming reconstructed from early Paleogene greenhouse climates and demands a close examination of the forcing and feedback mechanisms that maintained this warmth and the broad dynamic range that these paleoclimate records attest to. Here, we show that several complementary resolutions to these questions are possible in the context of model simulations using modern and early Paleogene configurations. We find that (i) changes in boundary conditions representative of slow ``Earth system'' feedbacks play an important role in maintaining elevated early Paleogene temperatures, (ii) radiative forcing by carbon dioxide deviates significantly from pure logarithmic behavior at concentrations relevant for simulation of the early Paleogene, and (iii) fast or ``Charney'' climate sensitivity in this model increases sharply as the climate warms. Thus, increased forcing and increased slow and fast sensitivity can all play a substantial role in maintaining early Paleogene warmth. This poses an equifinality problem: The same climate can be maintained by a different mix of these ingredients; however, at present, the mix cannot be constrained directly from climate proxy data. The implications of strongly state-dependent fast sensitivity reach far beyond the early Paleogene. The study of past warm climates may not narrow uncertainty in future climate projections in coming centuries because fast climate sensitivity may itself be state-dependent, but proxies and models are both consistent with significant increases in fast sensitivity with increasing temperature.},

ENSO events tend to have a centre\textemdash corresponding to the location of the maximum SST anomaly\textemdash in either the central equatorial Pacific (5\textdegree ~S\textendash 5\textdegree ~N, 160\textdegree ~E\textendash 150\textdegree ~W) or the eastern equatorial Pacific (5\textdegree ~S\textendash 5\textdegree ~N, 150\textdegree\textendash 90\textdegree ~W); these two distinct types of ENSO event are referred to as the CP-ENSO and EP-ENSO regimes, respectively. How the ENSO may change under future greenhouse warming is unknown, owing to a lack of inter-model agreement over the response of SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific to such warming. Here we find a robust increase in future EP-ENSO SST variability among CMIP5 climate models that simulate the two distinct ENSO regimes. We show that the EP-ENSO SST anomaly pattern and its centre differ greatly from one model to another, and therefore cannot be well represented by a single SST `index' at the observed centre. However, although the locations of the anomaly centres differ in each model, we find a robust increase in SST variability at each anomaly centre across the majority of models considered. This increase in variability is largely due to greenhouse-warming-induced intensification of upper-ocean stratification in the equatorial Pacific, which enhances ocean\textendash atmosphere coupling. An increase in SST variance implies an increase in the number of `strong' EP-El Ni\~no events (corresponding to large SST anomalies) and associated extreme weather events.},

We demonstrate that the isolation of individual feedbacks in the CFRAM is achieved without referencing to a virtual climate system as in the online feedback suppression method. We show that partial temperature changes estimated by the online feedback suppression method include the ``compensating effects'' of other feedbacks when the feedback under consideration is suppressed. The partial temperature changes are addable in the CFRAM but they are not in the online feedback suppression method. We also apply the CFRAM to isolate the contributions to the lapse rate feedback from individual physical and dynamical feedback processes. We show that the lapse rate feedback includes not only the partial effect of each feedback that directly contributes to energy flux perturbations at the TOA (such as water vapor feedback), but also the total effects of those feedbacks that do not contribute to energy flux perturbations at the TOA (such as evaporation and moist convection feedbacks). Because the contributions to the lapse rate feedback from various physical and dynamical processes tend to cancel one another, the net lapse rate feedback is a residual of many large terms. This leads to a large uncertainty not only in estimating the lapse rate feedback itself, but also in other feedbacks whose effects are either partially or totally lumped into the lapse rate feedback.},

  abstract = {Abstract Emergent constraints are quantities that are observable from current measurements and have skill predicting future climate. This study explores 19 previously proposed emergent constraints related to equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS; the global-average equilibrium surface temperature response to CO2 doubling). Several constraints are shown to be closely related, emphasizing the importance for careful understanding of proposed constraints. A new method is presented for decomposing correlation between an emergent constraint and ECS into terms related to physical processes and geographical regions. Using this decomposition, one can determine whether the processes and regions explaining correlation with ECS correspond to the physical explanation offered for the constraint. Shortwave cloud feedback is generally found to be the dominant contributor to correlations with ECS because it is the largest source of intermodel spread in ECS. In all cases, correlation results from interaction between a variety of terms, reflecting the complex nature of ECS and the fact that feedback terms and forcing are themselves correlated with each other. For 4 of the 19 constraints, the originally proposed explanation for correlation is borne out by our analysis. These four constraints all predict relatively high climate sensitivity. The credibility of six other constraints is called into question owing to correlation with ECS coming mainly from unexpected sources and/or lack of robustness to changes in ensembles. Another six constraints lack a testable explanation and hence cannot be confirmed. The fact that this study casts doubt upon more constraints than it confirms highlights the need for caution when identifying emergent constraints from small ensembles.},

The authors begin by noting several issues with the standard approach for decomposing ECS into a sum of forcing and feedback terms. This leads to a derivation of an alternative method based on linearizing the effect of the net feedback. Consistent with previous studies, the new method identifies shortwave cloud feedback as the dominant source of intermodel spread in ECS. This new approach also reveals that covariances between cloud feedback and forcing, between lapse rate and longwave cloud feedbacks, and between albedo and shortwave cloud feedbacks play an important and previously underappreciated role in determining model differences in ECS. Defining feedbacks based on fixed relative rather than specific humidity (as suggested by Held and Shell) reduces the covariances between processes and leads to more straightforward interpretations of results.},

During an event, a poleward anomaly in Ftrop initially increases the sensible and latent energy of the Arctic troposphere; as the warm and moist troposphere loses heat, the anomalous energy source is balanced by a flux upward across the tropopause and a downward net surface flux. A new metric for the Arctic surface heating efficiency (Etrop) is defined, which measures the fraction of the energy source that reaches the surface. Composites of high, medium, and low-efficiency events help identify key physical factors, including the vertical structure of Ftrop and Arctic surface preconditioning. In high-efficiency events (Etrop {$\geq$} 0.63), a bottom-heavy poleward Ftrop occurs in the presence of an anomalously warm and unstratified Arctic\textemdash a consequence of decreased sea ice\textemdash resulting in increased vertical mixing, enhanced near-surface warming and moistening, and further sea ice loss. Smaller Etrop, and thus weaker surface impacts, are found in events with anomalously large initial sea ice extent and more vertically uniform Ftrop. These differences in Etrop are manifest primarily through turbulent heat fluxes rather than downward longwave radiation. The frequency of high-efficiency events has increased from the period 1980\textendash 1999 to 2000\textendash 2019, contributing to Arctic surface warming and sea ice decline.},

This, together with acknowledged impacts on other components of the Earth system, has led to the term ``the new Arctic.'' Global coupled climate models predict that ice loss will continue through the twenty-first century, with implications for governance, economics, security, and global weather. A wide range in model projections reflects the complex, highly coupled interactions between the polar atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere, including teleconnections to lower latitudes. This paper summarizes our present understanding of how heat reaches the ice base from the original sources\textemdash inflows of Atlantic and Pacific Water, river discharge, and summer sensible heat and shortwave radiative fluxes at the ocean/ice surface\textemdash and speculates on how such processes may change in the new Arctic. The complexity of the coupled Arctic system, and the logistic and technological challenges of working in the Arctic Ocean, require a coordinated interdisciplinary and international program that will not only improve understanding of this critical component of global climate but will also provide opportunities to develop human resources with the skills required to tackle related problems in complex climate systems. We propose a research strategy with components that include 1) improved mapping of the upper- and middepth Arctic Ocean, 2) enhanced quantification of important process, 3) expanded long-term monitoring at key heat-flux locations, and 4) development of numerical capabilities that focus on parameterization of heat-flux mechanisms and their interactions.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Here we investigate this issue using the simulations of the NCAR Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) Project focusing on strong El Ni\~no events of the Eastern Pacific (EP) that can be associated to flooding in Northern and Central Peru. It is shown that, in the warmer climate, the duration of strong EP El Ni\~no events peaking in boreal winter is extended by two months, which results in significantly more events peaking in February\textendash March\textendash April (FMA), the season when the climatological Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone is at its southernmost location. This larger persistence of strong EP events is interpreted as resulting from both a stronger recharge process and a more effective thermocline feedback in the eastern equatorial Pacific due to increased mean vertical stratification. A heat budget analysis reveals in particular that the reduction in seasonal upwelling rate is compensated by the increase in anomalous vertical temperature gradient within the surface layer, yielding an overall increase in the effectiveness of the thermocline feedback. In CESM-LE, the appearance of strong EP El Ni\~no events peaking in FMA accounts for one-quarter of the increase in frequency of occurrence of ENSO-induced extreme precipitation events, while one-third results from weak-to-moderate El Ni\~no events that triggers extreme precipitation events because of the warmer mean SST becoming closer to the convective threshold. In CESM-LE, both the increase in mean EP SST and the change in ENSO processes thus contribute to the increase in extreme precipitation events in the warmer climate.},

While the latitudinal expansion of the tropics would induce both a poleward shift and reinforcement of the westerlies, Arctic changes might counterbalance this effect. Beyond position and speed, potential changes in the flow waviness are crucial for midlatitude weather. Here we investigate such changes through an intuitive metric characterizing the flow sinuosity at 50\textdegree N. We find that despite a slight increase in recent reanalyses, the midlatitude sinuosity is projected to decrease in response to climate change according to CMIP5 simulations. Recent trends could therefore result from internal variability or different timings of tropical and polar influences. Future uncertainties are dominated by model discrepancies and partially linked to the dispersion in the equator-to-pole temperature gradient response. Our results support the hypothesis that a faster westerly flow is expected to be less sinuous (and vice-versa).},

This allows a unique, consistent comparison between regions that cannot be consistently compared using ground-based records because of varying data collection standards. Severe hailstorms are indicated most often in a broad region of northern Argentina and southern Paraguay and a smaller region in Bangladesh and eastern India. Numerous hailstorms are also estimated in the central and southeastern United States, northern Pakistan and northwestern India, central and western Africa, and southeastern Africa (and adjacent waters). Fewer hailstorms are estimated for other regions over land and scattered across subtropical oceans. Very few are estimated in the deep tropics other than in Africa. Most continental regions show seasonality with hailstorms peaking in late spring or summer. The South Asian monsoon alters the hailstorm climatology around the Indian subcontinent. About 75\% of the hailstorms on the eastern side (around Bangladesh) occur from April through June, generally before monsoon onset. Activity shifts northwest to northern India in late June and July. An arc along the foothills in northern Pakistan becomes particularly active from mid-June through mid-August. The AMSR-E measurements are limited to early afternoon and late night. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) measurements are used to investigate diurnal variability in the tropics and subtropics. All of the prominent regions have hailstorm peaks in late afternoon and early evening. The United States and central Africa have the fewest overnight and early morning storms, while subtropical South America and Bangladesh have the most.},

We review the main mechanisms for cloud feedbacks, and discuss their representation in climate models and the sources of intermodel spread. Global-mean cloud feedback in GCMs results from three main effects: (1) rising free-tropospheric clouds (a positive longwave effect); (2) decreasing tropical low cloud amount (a positive shortwave [SW] effect); (3) increasing high-latitude low cloud optical depth (a negative SW effect). These cloud responses simulated by GCMs are qualitatively supported by theory, high-resolution modeling, and observations. Rising high clouds are consistent with the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis, whereby enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling causes anvil cloud tops to remain at a nearly fixed temperature as the atmosphere warms. Tropical low cloud amount decreases are driven by a delicate balance between the effects of vertical turbulent fluxes, radiative cooling, large-scale subsidence, and lower-tropospheric stability on the boundary-layer moisture budget. High-latitude low cloud optical depth increases are dominated by phase changes in mixed-phase clouds. The causes of intermodel spread in cloud feedback are discussed, focusing particularly on the role of unresolved parameterized processes such as cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection.

The cloud effect is isolated by locking the clouds to either the control or 4xCO2 state in the shortwave (SW) or longwave (LW) radiation schemes. In the model, cloud radiative changes explain more than half of the total poleward expansion of the Hadley cells, midlatitude jets, and storm tracks under CO2 quadrupling, even though they cause only one-fourth of the total global-mean surface warming. The effect of clouds on circulation results mainly from the SW cloud radiative changes, which strongly enhance the equator-to-pole temperature gradient at all levels in the troposphere, favoring stronger and poleward-shifted midlatitude eddies. By contrast, quadrupling CO2 while holding the clouds fixed causes strong polar amplification and weakened midlatitude baroclinicity at lower levels, yielding only a small poleward expansion of the circulation. The results show that 1) the atmospheric circulation responds sensitively to cloud-driven changes in meridional and vertical temperature distribution and 2) the spatial structure of cloud feedbacks likely plays a dominant role in the circulation response to greenhouse gas forcing. While the magnitude and spatial structure of the cloud feedback are expected to be highly model dependent, an analysis of 4xCO2 simulations of CMIP5 models shows that the SW cloud feedback likely forces a poleward expansion of the tropospheric circulation in most climate models.},

Jet shifts produce robust meridional dipoles in upper-level clouds and longwave cloud-radiative effect (CRE), but low-level clouds, which do not simply shift with the jet, dominate the shortwave CRE. Because the effect of jet variability on CRE is relatively small, future poleward jet shifts with global warming are only a second-order contribution to the total CRE changes around the midlatitudes, suggesting a dominant role for thermodynamic effects. This implies that constraining the dynamical response is unlikely to reduce the uncertainty in extratropical cloud feedback. However, we argue that uncertainty in the cloud-radiative response does affect the atmospheric circulation response to global warming, by modulating patterns of diabatic forcing. How cloud feedbacks can affect the dynamical response to global warming is an important topic of future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract The projected response of the atmospheric circulation to the radiative changes induced by CO2 forcing and climate feedbacks is currently uncertain. In this modeling study, the impact of CO2-induced climate feedbacks on changes in jet latitude and speed is assessed by imposing surface albedo, cloud, and water vapor feedbacks as if they were forcings in two climate models, CAM4 and ECHAM6. The jet response to radiative feedbacks can be broadly interpreted through changes in midlatitude baroclinicity. Clouds enhance baroclinicity, favoring a strengthened, poleward-shifted jet; this is mitigated by surface albedo changes, which have the opposite effect on baroclinicity and the jet, while water vapor has opposing effects on upper- and lower-level baroclinicity with little net impact on the jet. Large differences between the CAM4 and ECHAM6 responses illustrate how model uncertainty in radiative feedbacks causes a large spread in the baroclinicity response to CO2 forcing. Across the CMIP5 models, differences in shortwave feedbacks by clouds and albedo are a dominant contribution to this spread. Forcing CAM4 with shortwave cloud and albedo feedbacks from a representative set of CMIP5 models yields a wide range of jet responses that strongly correlate with the meridional gradient of the anomalous shortwave heating and the associated baroclinicity response. Differences in shortwave feedbacks statistically explain about 50\% of the intermodel spread in CMIP5 jet shifts for the set of models used, demonstrating the importance of constraining radiative feedbacks for accurate projections of circulation changes.},

Here the importance of microphysical processes for the negative optical depth feedback is assessed by perturbing temperature in the microphysics schemes of two aquaplanet models, both of which have separate prognostic equations for liquid water and ice. It is found that most of the LWP increase with warming is caused by a suppression of ice microphysical processes in mixed-phase clouds, resulting in reduced conversion efficiencies of liquid water to ice and precipitation. Perturbing the temperature-dependent phase partitioning of convective condensate also yields a small LWP increase. Together, the perturbations in large-scale microphysics and convective condensate partitioning explain more than two-thirds of the LWP response relative to a reference case with increased SSTs, and capture all of the vertical structure of the liquid water response. In support of these findings, a very robust positive relationship between monthly mean LWP and temperature in CMIP5 models and observations is shown to exist in mixed-phase cloud regions only. In models, the historical LWP sensitivity to temperature is a good predictor of the forced global warming response poleward of about 45\textdegree, although models appear to overestimate the LWP response to warming compared to observations. The results indicate that in climate models, the suppression of ice-phase microphysical processes that deplete cloud liquid water is a key driver of the LWP increase with warming and of the associated negative shortwave cloud feedback.},

We demonstrate the existence of an ``interhemispheric teleconnection,'' whereby warming (cooling) the Northern Hemisphere causes both the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and the Southern Hemispheric midlatitude jet to shift northward (southward). The interhemispheric teleconnection is effected by a change in the asymmetry of the Hadley cells: as the ITCZ shifts away from the Equator, the cross-equatorial Hadley cell intensifies, fluxing more momentum toward the subtropics and sustaining a stronger subtropical jet. Changes in subtropical jet strength, in turn, alter the propagation of extratropical waves into the tropics, affecting eddy momentum fluxes and the eddy-driven westerlies. The relevance of this mechanism is demonstrated in the context of future climate change simulations, where shifts of the ITCZ are significantly related to shifts of the Southern Hemispheric eddy-driven jet in austral winter. The possible relevance of the proposed mechanism to paleoclimates is discussed, particularly with regard to theories of ice age terminations.},

Here, we show that the evolution of climate feedbacks in models is consistent with the effect of a change in tropospheric stability, as has recently been hypothesized, and the latter is itself driven by the evolution of the pattern of sea-surface temperature response. The change in climate feedback is mainly associated with a decrease in marine tropical low cloud (a more positive shortwave cloud feedback) and with a less negative lapse-rate feedback, as expected from a decrease in stability. Smaller changes in surface albedo and humidity feedbacks also contribute to the overall change in feedback, but are unexplained by stability. The spatial pattern of feedback changes closely matches the pattern of stability changes, with the largest increase in feedback occurring in the tropical East Pacific. Relationships qualitatively similar to those in the models among sea-surface temperature pattern, stability, and radiative budget are also found in observations on interannual time scales. Our results suggest that constraining the future evolution of sea-surface temperature patterns and tropospheric stability will be necessary for constraining climate sensitivity.},

The relationship is such that models with increases in the meridional ASR gradient around the southern midlatitudes, and therefore increases in midlatitude baroclinicity, tend to produce a larger poleward jet shift. The ASR changes are shown to be dominated by changes in cloud properties, with sea ice declines playing a secondary role. We demonstrate that the ASR changes are the cause, and not the result, of the intermodel differences in jet response by comparing coupled simulations with experiments in which sea surface temperature increases are prescribed. Our results highlight the importance of reducing the uncertainty in cloud feedbacks in order to constrain future circulation changes.},

Analysis of the space\textendash time spectra of eddy momentum flux reveals that variations in eddy-driven jet speed are related to changes in the mean phase speed of midlatitude eddies. An increase in eddy phase speeds induces a poleward shift of the critical latitudes and a poleward expansion of the region of subtropical wave breaking. The associated changes in eddy momentum flux convergence are balanced by anomalous meridional winds consistent with a wider Hadley cell. At the same time, faster eddies are also associated with a strengthened poleward eddy momentum flux, sustaining a stronger westerly jet in midlatitudes. The proposed mechanism is consistent with the seasonal dependence of the interannual variability of the Hadley cell width and appears to explain at least part of the projected twenty-first-century trends.},

This intercomparison uses sea surface temperature change as a surrogate for climate change. The interpretation of cloud-climate interactions is given special attention. A roughly threefold variation in one measure of global climate sensitivity is found among the 19 models. The important conclusion is that most of this variation is attributable to differences in the models' depiction of cloud feedback, a result that emphasizes the need for improvements in the treatment of clouds in these models if they are ultimately to be used as reliable climate predictors. It is further emphasized that cloud feedback is the consequence of all interacting physical and dynamical processes in a general circulation model. The result of these processes is to produce changes in temperature, moisture distribution, and clouds which are integrated into the radiative response termed cloud feedback.},

These nonlinearities are relatively large and widespread throughout the tropics and so should not be neglected in projections of future precipitation change. This has implications for the use of pattern scaling and simple climate models to produce precipitation projections and for physical understanding of precipitation change across forcing scenarios. The nonlinearities can be understood by considering that processes which cause precipitation change, such as increasing moisture, a weakening circulation, and convergence zone shifts, interact in a nonlinear manner even when individual processes are quasi-linear. Three driver interactions are identified: ``warm-shift'', ``warm-weak'', and ``shift-weak''. Combined with Clausius-Clapeyron nonlinearity in moisture increase, these interactions drive the nonlinear pattern change. A strong convergence feedback response substantially amplifies the nonlinearity. This analysis is limited to ocean regions, as mechanisms are simpler than over land.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper reviews the current state of observational, theoretical, and modeling knowledge of the midlatitude storm tracks of the Northern Hemisphere cool season. Observed storm track structures and variations form the first part of the review. The climatological storm track structure is described, and the seasonal, interannual, and interdecadal storm track variations are discussed. In particular, the observation that the Pacific storm track exhibits a marked minimum during midwinter when the background baroclinicity is strongest, and a new finding that storm tracks exhibit notable variations in their intensity on decadal timescales, are highlighted as challenges that any comprehensive storm track theory or model has to be able to address. Physical processes important to storm track dynamics make up the second part of the review. The roles played by baroclinic processes, linear instability, downstream development, barotropic modulation, and diabatic heating are discussed. Understanding of these processes forms the core of our current theoretical knowledge of storm track dynamics, and provides a context within which both observational and modeling results can be interpreted. The eddy energy budget is presented to show that all of these processes are important in the maintenance of the storm tracks. The final part of the review deals with the ability to model storm tracks. The success as well as remaining problems in idealized storm track modeling, which is based on a linearized dynamical system, are discussed. Perhaps on a more pragmatic side, it is pointed out that while the current generation of atmospheric general circulation models faithfully reproduce the climatological storm track structure, and to a certain extent, the seasonal and ENSO-related interannual variations of storm tracks, in-depth comparisons between observed and modeled storm track variations are still lacking.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study evaluates the performance of models from phase 5 and phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) by comparing feedbacks in models with those inferred from observations. Overall, we find no systematic disagreements between the feedbacks in the model ensembles and feedbacks inferred from observations, although there is a wide range in the ability of individual models to reproduce the observations. In particular, 40 of 52 models have best estimates that fall within the uncertainty of the observed total feedback. We quantify two sources of uncertainty in the model ensembles: 1) the structural difference, due to the differences in model parameterizations, and 2) the unforced pattern effect, due to unforced variability, and find that both are important when comparing with an 18-yr observational dataset. We perform the comparison using two energy balance frameworks: the traditional energy balance framework, in which it is assumed that changes in energy balance are controlled by changes in global average surface temperatures, and an alternative framework that assumes the changes in energy balance are controlled by tropical atmospheric temperatures. We find that the alternative framework provides a more robust way of comparing the models with observations, with both smaller structural differences and smaller unforced pattern effect. However, when considering the relation of feedbacks in response to interannual variability and long-term warming, the traditional framework has advantages. There are no great differences between the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles' ability to reproduce the observed feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Abstract A barotropic channel model is used to study the planetary-scale motions of an atmosphere whose zonal flow is externally driven. Perturbations are induced by topography and by d barotropic analogue of thermal driving. The use of highly truncated spectral expansions shows that there may exist a multiplicity of equilibrium states for a given driving, of which two or more may be stable. In the case of topographical forcing, two stable equilibrium states of very different character may be produced by the same forcing: one is a ``low-index'' flow with a strong wave component and a relatively weaker zonal component which is locked close to linear resonance; the other is a ``high-index'' flow with a weak wave component and a relatively stronger zonal component which is much farther from linear resonance. It is suggested that the phenomenon of blocking is a metastable equilibrium state of the low-index near-resonant character. The existence of the two types of equilibria has been confirmed by numerical integration of a grid-point model with many more degrees of freedom than the spectral model. It has also been found spectrally and for a grid-point model that oscillations may occur when one of the equilibrium states is stable for the lowest order spectral components but unstable for the next higher order components. The oscillation apparently is due to a barotropic instability of the topographic wave of the kind discussed by Lorenz and Gill. Thermal forcing also produces multiple, stable equilibria in a spectral model but confirmation with a grid-point model has so far not been obtained.},

The model is phrased in terms of static energy, and it allows for independent variation of the boundary layer and free troposphere separated by a capping inversion. An algorithm is presented to apply the model to generate a sounding for numerical simulations of severe convective storms, and the model is compared and contrasted with that of Weisman and Klemp. The model is then fit to a case-study sounding associated with the 3 May 1999 tornado outbreak, and its potential utility is demonstrated via idealized numerical simulation experiments. A long-lived supercell is successfully simulated with the historical sounding but not the analogous theoretical sounding. Two types of example experiments are then performed that do simulate a long-lived supercell: 1) a semitheoretical experiment in which a portion of the theoretical sounding is modified to match the real sounding (low-level moisture); 2) a fully theoretical experiment in which a model physical parameter is modified (free-tropospheric relative humidity). Overall, the construction of this minimal model is flexible and amenable to additional modifications as needed. The model offers a novel framework that may be useful for testing how severe convective storms depend on the vertical structure of the hydrostatic environment, as well as for linking variability in these environments to the physical processes that produce them within the climate system.},

All of the planets orbit nearby M-stars and are likely tidally locked in 1:1 spin\textendash orbit states, which motivates the consideration of the effects that tidal locking might have on planetary habitability. On Earth, periods of global glaciation (snowballs) may have been essential for habitability and remote signs of life (biosignatures) because they are correlated with increases in the complexity of life and in the atmospheric oxygen concentration. In this paper, we investigate the snowball bifurcation (sudden onset of global glaciation) on tidally locked planets using both an energy balance model and an intermediate-complexity global climate model. We show that tidally locked planets are unlikely to exhibit a snowball bifurcation as a direct result of the spatial pattern of insolation they receive. Instead, they will smoothly transition from partial to complete ice coverage and back. A major implication of this work is that tidally locked planets with an active carbon cycle should not be found in a snowball state. Moreover, this work implies that tidally locked planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone with low CO2 outgassing fluxes will equilibrate with a small unglaciated substellar region rather than cycling between warm and snowball states. More work is needed to determine how the lack of a snowball bifurcation might affect the development of life on a tidally locked planet.},

The recent and projected polar warming, and its effects on the meridional temperature gradients, suggests a possible weakening of eddy heat fluxes. We here examine this question in reanalyses and state-of-the-art global climate models. In the Northern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly weakened over the last four decades. We further show that this weakening emerged from the internal variability around the year 2000, and we attribute it to increasing greenhouse gases. In contrast, in the Southern Hemisphere we find that the eddy heat flux has robustly strengthened, and we link this strengthening to the recent multi-decadal cooling of Southern-Ocean surface temperatures. The inability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate such cooling prevents them from capturing the observed Southern Hemisphere strengthening of the eddy heat flux. This discrepancy between models and reanalyses provides a clear example of how model biases in polar regions can affect the midlatitude climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract Climate models project an intensification of the wintertime North Atlantic storm track, over its downstream region, by the end of this century. Previous studies have suggested that ocean-atmosphere coupling plays a key role in this intensification, but the precise role of the different components of the coupling has not been explored and quantified. In this paper, using a hierarchy of ocean coupling experiments, we isolate and quantify the respective roles of thermodynamic (changes in surface heat fluxes) and dynamic (changes in ocean heat flux convergence) ocean coupling in the projected intensification of North Atlantic transient eddy kinetic energy (TEKE). We show that dynamic coupling accounts for nearly all of the future TEKE strengthening as it overcomes the much smaller effect of surface heat flux changes to weaken the TEKE. We further show that by reducing the Arctic amplification in the North Atlantic, ocean heat flux convergence increases the meridional temperature gradient aloft, causing a larger eddy growth rate, and resulting in the strengthening of North Atlantic TEKE. Our results stress the importance of better monitoring and investigating the changes in ocean heat transport, for improving climate change adaptation strategies.},

By the end of this century, winter mid-latitude storms are projected to intensify in the Southern Hemisphere, with large consequences over the entire extra-tropics. Therefore, it is critical to be able to accurately assess the impacts of anthropogenic emissions on these storms to improve societal preparedness for future changes. Here we show that current climate models severely underestimate the intensification in mid-latitude storm tracks in recent decades. Specifically, the intensification obtained from reanalyses has already reached the model-projected end-of-the-century intensification. The biased intensification is found to be linked to biases in the zonal flow. These results question the ability of climate models to accurately predict the future impacts of anthropogenic emissions in the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.},

Climate projections show a robust weakening of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley circulation by the end of the twenty-first century. Over the past several decades, however, atmospheric reanalyses indicate a strengthening of the Hadley circulation. Here we show that the strengthening of the circulation in the Northern Hemisphere is not seen in climate models; instead, these models simulate a weakening of the circulation in the past 40\,years. Using observations and a large ensemble of model simulations we elucidate this discrepancy between climate models and reanalyses, and show that it does not stem from internal climate variability or biases in climate models, but appears related to artefacts in the representation of latent heating in the reanalyses. Our results highlight the role of anthropogenic emissions in the recent slowdown of the atmospheric circulation, which is projected to continue in coming decades, and question the reliability of reanalyses for estimating trends in the Hadley circulation.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric convective available potential energy (CAPE) is expected to increase under greenhouse gas\textendash induced global warming, but a recent regional study also suggests enhanced convective inhibition (CIN) over land although its cause is not well understood. In this study, a global climate model is first evaluated by comparing its CAPE and CIN with reanalysis data, and then their future changes and the underlying causes are examined. The climate model reasonably captures the present-day CAPE and CIN patterns seen in the reanalysis, and projects increased CAPE almost everywhere and stronger CIN over most land under global warming. Over land, the cases or times with medium to strong CAPE or CIN would increase while cases with weak CAPE or CIN would decrease, leading to an overall strengthening in their mean values. These projected changes are confirmed by convection-permitting 4-km model simulations over the United States. The CAPE increase results mainly from increased low-level specific humidity, which leads to more latent heating and buoyancy for a lifted parcel above the level of free convection (LFC) and also a higher level of neutral buoyancy. The enhanced CIN over most land results mainly from reduced low-level relative humidity (RH), which leads to a higher lifting condensation level and a higher LFC and thus more negative buoyancy. Over tropical oceans, the near-surface RH increases slightly, leading to slight weakening of CIN. Over the subtropical eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean, the impact of reduced low-level atmospheric lapse rates overshadows the effect of increased specific humidity, leading to decreased CAPE.},

Here we explore this issue from the perspective of precipitation partitioning.

Convective precipitation has higher frequency and longer duration but lower intensity than non-convective precipitation in many models. As a result, the high PC/PR ratio contributes to the ``drizzling'' bias over low latitudes. The PC/PR ratio and associated ``drizzling'' bias increase as model resolution coarsens from 0.5\textdegree{} to 2.0\textdegree, but the resolution's effect weakens as the grid spacing increases from 2.0\textdegree{} to 3.0\textdegree. Some of the CMIP6 models show reduced ``drizzling'' bias associated with decreased PC/PR ratio. Thus, more reasonable precipitation partitioning, along with finer model resolution should alleviate the ``drizzling'' bias within current climate models.},

Simulations show that, relative to the baseline, strategic stratospheric aerosol geoengineering generally maintains northern winter December\textendash January\textendash February (DJF) HC intensity under RCP8.5, while it overcompensates for the greenhouse gas (GHG)-forced southern winter June\textendash July\textendash August (JJA) HC intensity increase, producing a 3.5\,{$\pm$}\,0.4\% weakening. The residual change of southern HC intensity in JJA is mainly associated with stratospheric heating and tropospheric temperature response due to enhanced stratospheric aerosol concentrations. Geoengineering overcompensates for the GHG-driven northward ITCZ shifts, producing 0.7\textdegree\,{$\pm$}\,0.1\textdegree{} and 0.2\textdegree\,{$\pm$}\,0.1\textdegree{} latitude southward migrations in JJA and DJF, respectively relative to the baseline. These migrations are affected by tropical interhemispheric temperature differences both at the surface and in the free troposphere.

To investigate how radiative and dynamical adjustments modify the influence of cloud-radiative changes on energy transport, this study applies a cloud-locking technique in a fully coupled climate model, CESM. Under global warming, the impacts of cloud-radiative changes on the meridional energy transport are asymmetric in the two hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, the cloud-radiative changes have little impact on energy transport because 89\% of the cloud-induced heating is balanced locally by increasing outgoing longwave radiation. In the Southern Hemisphere, on the other hand, cloud-induced dynamical changes in the atmosphere and the ocean cause enhanced poleward energy transport, accounting for most of the increase in energy transport under warming. Our experiments highlight that the local longwave radiation adjustment induced by temperature variation can partially offset the impacts of cloud-radiative changes on energy transport, making the estimated impacts smaller than those obtained from directly integrating cloud-radiative changes in previous studies. It is also demonstrated that the cloud-radiative impacts on temperature and energy transport can be significantly modulated by the oceanic circulation, suggesting the necessity of considering atmospheric\textendash oceanic coupling when estimating the impacts of cloud-radiative changes on the climate system.},

Here the response of UB to stepwise tropospheric warming over the BKS is examined using a dry dynamic core model. Nonlinear responses are found in the frequency and local persistence of UB. The frequency and local persistence of the UB increase with the strength of BKS warming in a less strong range and decrease with the further increase of BKS warming, which is linked to the UB propagation influenced by upstream background atmospheric circulation. For a weak BKS warming, the UB becomes more persistent due to its less westward movement associated with intensified upstream zonal wind and meridional potential vorticity gradient (PVy) in the North Atlantic mid-high latitudes, which corresponds to a negative height response over the North Atlantic high latitudes. When BKS warming is strong, a positive height response appears in the early winter stratosphere, and its subsequent downward propagation leads to a negative NAO response or increased Greenland blocking events, which reduces zonal wind and PVy in the high latitudes from North Atlantic to Europe, thus enhancing the westward propagation of UB and reducing its local persistence. The transition to the negative NAO phase and the retrogression of UB are not found when numerically suppressing the downward influence of weakened stratospheric polar vortex, suggesting a crucial role of the stratospheric pathway in nonlinear responses of UB to the early winter BKS warming.},

AA weakens meridional temperature gradients and is hypothesized to weaken zonal wind and cause wavier circulation with stronger meridional wind (v) over northern mid-high latitudes. Here model simulations are analyzed to examine the v response to increased CO2 and AA alone. Total v changes are found to be dominated by the effect of increased CO2 without AA, with a zonal wavenumber-4 (3) change pattern over the northern (southern) extratropics that generally enhances current v and results partly from changes in zonal temperature gradients. The extratropical v change patterns are quasi-barotropic and are more pronounced during boreal winter. The CO2 forcing also causes baroclinic v changes over the tropics tied to convection changes. AA's impact on v is mainly over the northern extratropics and is opposite to the effect of increased CO2 but with smaller magnitudes. An eastward shift ({$\sim$}5\textdegree{} longitude) and an amplitude increase ({$\sim$}1 m/s) in the climatology of the northerlies over Europe caused mainly by CO2 forcing contribute to the drying in southern Europe, while both AA and CO2 forcing enhance the climatology of the northerlies over East Asia. Over northern mid-high latitudes, Arctic sea-ice loss and AA enhance the land-ocean thermal contrast, while increased CO2 alone weakens it, resulting in opposite changes in zonal temperature gradients and thus v. Different warming rates over land and ocean also contribute to the inter-model spread in v response patterns among climate models.},

Sixty-eight events are identified and their physical structure is diagnosed using thermodynamic and geostrophic vorticity tendency equations. In climatology, horizontal advections play a fundamental role in constructing a USB event, in which the anticyclonic center is a warm core in the troposphere and a cold core in the lower stratosphere. The decay of the thermal structure is related to diabatic cooling along the vertical structure and warm advection in the lower stratosphere. Meanwhile, the collapse of the height structure is caused primarily by cyclonic vorticity advection. A strong interrelationship exists between the intensity and extension of USB events. The temporal characteristics of USB events are analyzed by examining strong and weak events, which are of high and low intensity. The strong events are probably preceded by an open ridge over Europe and a cyclogenesis over the Mediterranean Sea, and their formation is followed by the stronger amplification of a Rossby wave packet across Eurasia. On the other hand, the weak events are likely to be triggered by surface cold anomalies over Siberia. Overall, the evolution of a USB event forms a dynamic linkage with the Siberian high, in which the decay stage of the USB event is accompanied by a southeastward migration of the Siberian high and a subsequent cold air outbreak in East Asia. These results advance our understanding of USB and its relationship with East Asian winter monsoon activities.},

This teleconnection has been largely motivated by studies that show a global synchronization of rapid climate change during abrupt climate changes of the last glacial period, in addition to attribution studies of twentieth-century Sahel drought and studies that examined the climate impacts of anthropogenic aerosols. This research has led to interesting developments in atmospheric dynamics of the underlying mechanisms and in applications toward understanding past and present tropical climate change. The emerging teleconnection hypothesis promises to offer new insights into understanding future patterns of tropical rainfall changes due to interhemispheric thermal gradients from greenhouse warming, aerosols, and land-use change.},

  abstract = {We investigate the causes for a strong high latitude imposed ice (land or sea) influence on the marine Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the Community Climate Model version 3 coupled to a 50-m slab ocean. The marine ITCZ in all the ocean basins shift meridionally away from the hemisphere with an imposed added ice cover, altering the global Hadley circulation with an increased tropical subsidence in the hemisphere with imposed ice and uplift in the other. The effect appears to be independent of the longitudinal position of imposed ice. The anomalous ice induces a rapid cooling and drying of the air and surface over the entire high- and midlatitudes; subsequent progression of cold anomalies occurs in the Pacific and Atlantic northeasterly trade regions, where a wind-evaporation-sea surface temperature (SST) feedback initiates progression of a cold SST `front' towards the ITCZ latitudes. Once the cooler SST reaches the ITCZ latitude, the ITCZ shifts southwards, aided by positive feedbacks associated with the displacement. The ITCZ displacement transports moisture away from the colder and drier hemisphere into the other hemisphere, resulting in a pronounced hemispheric asymmetric response in anomalous specific humidity; we speculate that the atmospheric humidity plays a central role in the hemispheric asymmetric nature of the climate response to high latitude ice cover anomalies. From an energy balance viewpoint, the increased outgoing radiative flux at the latitudes of the imposed ice is compensated by an increased radiative energy flux at the tropical latitudes occupied by the displaced ITCZ, and subsequently transported by the altered Hadley and eddy circulations to the imposed ice latitudes. The situation investigated here may be applicable to past climates like the Last Glacial Maximum where hemispheric asymmetric changes to ice cover occurred. Major caveats to the conclusions drawn include omission of interactive sea ice physics and ocean dynamical feedback and sensitivity to atmospheric physics parameterizations across different models.},

  abstract = {Notable changes in the wintertime Arctic atmospheric circulation have occurred over the last few decades. Despite its importance in understanding the recent changes in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitude climate, it remains unclear whether and how these changes are affected by recent Arctic sea ice loss. In this study, a regional scale model is used to separate the direct sea ice influence from the natural variability of large-scale atmospheric circulation. Results show that, in response to sea ice loss, the increase of geopotential height in the mid-to-upper troposphere is robust across the simulations, but the magnitude of the response is highly dependent on the background state of the atmosphere. In most cases the sea ice loss-induced atmospheric warming is trapped near the surface due to the high vertical stability of winter Arctic lower troposphere, accordingly, resulting in a small response of geopotential height. However, when a low-pressure system is located over the Barents Sea, the relatively weak stability allows an upward transport of the surface warming, causing a significantly larger geopotential height increase. This strong state-dependence of atmospheric response which is also found in recent studies using global-scale model experiments, highlights the importance of accurately representing the atmospheric background state for numerical model assessments of sea ice influence.},

The control simulation, initialized 10 days before the SSW onset, successfully reproduces the SSW. As this event is preceded by the bomb cyclones in the North Pacific, their impact is tested by initializing the model without them. This sensitivity experiment shows much weaker polar-vortex deceleration than the control simulation, resulting in no distinct SSW onset. This difference is attributable to the dampened constructive linear interference between the climatological wave and the cyclone-related wavenumber-one anomaly in the sensitivity experiment. It weakens the vertical propagation of wavenumber-one wave into the stratosphere, thereby reducing wave breaking in the polar stratosphere. This result suggests that bomb cyclones should be considered for better understanding SSW and improving its predictability.},

  abstract = {Abstract Examining tropical regional precipitation anomalies under global warming in 10 coupled global climate models, several mechanisms are consistently found. The tendency of rainfall to increase in convergence zones with large climatological precipitation and to decrease in subsidence regions\textemdash the rich-get-richer mechanism\textemdash has previously been examined in different approximations by Chou and Neelin, and Held and Soden. The effect of increased moisture transported by the mean circulation (the ``direct moisture effect'' or ``thermodynamic component'' in respective terminology) is relatively robust, while dynamic feedback is poorly understood and differs among models. The argument outlined states that the thermodynamic component should be a good approximation for large-scale averages; this is confirmed for averages across convection zones and descent regions, respectively. Within the convergence zones, however, dynamic feedback can substantially increase or decrease precipitation anomalies. Regions of negative precipitation anomalies within the convergence zones are associated with local weakening of ascent, and some of these exhibit horizontal dry advection associated with the ``upped-ante'' mechanism. Regions of increased ascent have strong positive precipitation anomalies enhanced by moisture convergence. This dynamic feedback is consistent with reduced gross moist stability due to increased moisture not being entirely compensated by effects of tropospheric warming and a vertical extent of convection. Regions of reduced ascent with positive precipitation anomalies are on average associated with changes in the vertical structure of vertical velocity, which extends to higher levels. This yields an increase in the gross moist stability that opposes ascent. The reductions in ascent associated with gross moist stability and upped-ante effects, respectively, combine to yield reduced ascent averaged across the convergence zones. Over climatological subsidence regions, positive precipitation anomalies can be associated with a convergence zone shift induced locally by anomalous heat flux from the ocean. Negative precipitation anomalies have a contribution from the thermodynamic component but can be enhanced or reduced by changes in the vertical velocity. Regions of enhanced subsidence are associated with an increased outgoing longwave radiation or horizontal cold convection. Reductions of subsidence are associated with changes of the vertical profile of vertical velocity, increasing gross moist stability.},

In this study, the phase and amplitude of the diurnal precipitation cycle in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models are compared to satellite data. While some improvements align CMIP6 models closer to satellite observations, significant biases in the timing of peak precipitation remain, especially over land. Notably, precipitation over land in CMIP6 models still occurs {$\sim$}5.4 h too early; the diurnal cycle amplitude is {$\sim$}0.81 mm day-1 too small over the oceans. Further, the diurnal phase of oceanic precipitation correlates weakly with the equilibrium climate sensitivity in CMIP6 models: models with a later precipitation peak over oceans tend to exhibit a higher climate sensitivity.

We use a cloud-resolving model to study how imposed atmospheric radiative heating (such as that caused by greenhouse gases or absorbing aerosols) may alter precipitation intensity in the setting of radiative-convective equilibrium. It is found that the decrease in total precipitation is realized through preferentially reducing weak events. The intensity of strong precipitation events is maintained by a cancellation between the moistening of air parcels and weakening of updrafts. A boundary layer energy budget analysis suggests that free-tropospheric heating raises boundary layer temperatures mainly through a reduction in rain reevaporation. This insight leads to a predictive scaling for the surface sensible and latent flux changes. The results imply that cloud microphysical processes play a key role in shaping the temperature and precipitation responses to atmospheric heating.},

Here, by comparing multiple large ensembles of model simulations with available observations, we show that Antarctic sea ice has expanded due to ocean surface cooling associated with multidecadal variability in the Southern Ocean that temporarily outweighs the opposing forced response. In both observations and model simulations, Southern Ocean multidecadal variability is closely linked to internal variability in the tropics, especially in the Pacific, via atmospheric teleconnections. The linkages are, however, distinctly weaker in simulations than in observations, accompanied by a marked model\textendash observation mismatch in global warming resulting from potential model bias in the forced response and observed tropical variability. Thus, the forced response dominates in simulations, resulting in apparent model\textendash observation discrepancy.},

It is reported that this differential trend has resulted in a substantial weakening of the meridional SST gradient from the equatorial region to the South Asian coast during summer, to the extent that the gradient has nearly vanished recently. Based on simulations with the Community Climate Model Version 3 (CCM3), it is shown that the summertime weakening in the SST gradient weakens the monsoon circulation, resulting in less monsoon rainfall over India and excess rainfall in sub-Saharan Africa. The observed trend in SST is decomposed into a hypothetical uniform warming and a reduction in the meridional gradient. The uniform warming of the tropical Indian Ocean in the authors' simulations increases the Indian summer monsoon rainfall by 1\textendash 2 mm day\textsuperscript{-1}, which is opposed by a larger drying tendency due to the weakening of the SST gradient. The net effect is to decrease the Indian monsoon rainfall, while preventing the sub-Saharan region from becoming too dry.

Past hail climatology has typically relied on the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Climatic Data Center's (NOAA/NCDC) Storm Data publication, which has numerous reporting biases and nonmeteorological artifacts. This research seeks to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of contiguous United States (CONUS) hail fall, derived from multiradar multisensor (MRMS) algorithms for several years during the Next-Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) era, leveraging the Multiyear Reanalysis of Remotely Sensed Storms (MYRORSS) dataset at NOAA's National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). The primary MRMS product used in this study is the maximum expected size of hail (MESH). The preliminary climatology includes 42 months of quality controlled and reprocessed MESH grids, which spans the warm seasons for four years (2007\textendash 10), covering 98\% of all Storm Data hail reports during that time. The dataset has 0.01\textdegree{} latitude \texttimes{} 0.01\textdegree{} longitude \texttimes{} 31 vertical levels spatial resolution, and 5-min temporal resolution. Radar-based and reports-based methods of hail climatology are compared. MRMS MESH demonstrates superior coverage and resolution over Storm Data hail reports, and is largely unbiased. The results reveal a broad maximum of annual hail fall in the Great Plains and a diminished secondary maximum in the Southeast United States. Potential explanations for the differences in the two methods of hail climatology are also discussed.},

Because jet-induced vertical motion could influence the development of severe weather, these conceptual models, especially the ``four quadrant'' model for linear jet streaks, are often applied by operational forecasters. The present study examines the climatology of tornado, hail, and severe wind reports relative to upper-level jet streaks, along with temporal trends in storm report frequencies and changes in report distributions for different jet streak directions. In addition, composite fields (e.g., divergence, vertical velocity) are analyzed for jet streak regions to examine whether the fields correspond to what is expected from conceptual models of curved or linear jet streaks, and whether the fields help explain the storm report distributions. During the period analyzed, 84\% of storm reports were associated with upper-level jet streaks, with June\textendash August having the lowest percentages. In March and April the left-exit quadrant had the most storm reports, while after April the right-entrance quadrant was associated with the most reports. Composites revealed that tornado and hail reports are concentrated in the jet-exit region along the major jet axis and in the right-entrance quadrant. Wind reports have similar maxima, but the right-entrance quadrant maximum is more pronounced. Upper-level composite divergence fields generally correspond to what would be expected from the four-quadrant model, but differences in the magnitudes of the vertical velocity between the quadrants and locations of divergent\textendash convergent centers may have resulted from jet curvature. The maxima in the storm report distributions are not well collocated with the maxima in the upper-level divergence fields, but are much better collocated with low-level convergence maxima that exist in both exit regions and extend into the right-entrance region. Composites of divergence\textendash convergence with linear, cyclonic, and anticyclonic jet streaks also generally matched conceptual models for curved jet streaks, and it was found that wind reports have a notable maximum in the right-entrance quadrant of both anticyclonic and linear jet streaks. Finally, it was found that the upper-level divergence and vertical velocity in all jet-quadrants have a tendency to decrease as jet streak directions shift from SSW to NNW.},

This paper emphasizes the association of the majority of this turbulence with the pronounced vertical wind shear in and near the maximum wind speed centers that move along the jet stream. A physical model is proposed as a possible explanation of clear air turbulence, the associated cirrus bands and wind streaks in the jet maxima. This model is supported by an analogy drawn with similar low-level phenomena studied by Woodcock and others. The model can explain distribution of these features in the horizontal by means of helical vortices which are dependent upon proper vertical wind shear and stability conditions. The observed multiple layers in the vertical are also explained by this model. It is believed that the reason why most of the clear-air turbulence is found near the jet-stream maxima is simply because the necessary shear and stability conditions associated with this turbulence are most frequently fulfilled in that region.},

  abstract = {Abstract An attempt is made to determine the role of the ocean in establishing the mean tropical climate and its sensitivity to radiative perturbations. A simple two-box energy balance model is developed that includes ocean heat transports as an interactive component of the tropical climate system. It is found that changes in the zonal mean ocean heat transport can have a considerable affect on the mean tropical sea surface temperature (SST) through their effect on the properties of subtropical marine stratus clouds or on the water vapor greenhouse effect of the tropical atmosphere. The way that the tropical climate adjusts to changes in the ocean heat transport is primarily through the atmospheric heat transport, without changing the net top of the atmosphere radiative balance. Thus, the total amount of low-latitude poleward heat transport is invariant with respect to changes in ocean circulation in this model. These results are compared with analogous experiments with general circulation models. Doubled CO2 experiments are performed with different values of ocean heat transport. It is found that the sensitivity of the mean tropical SST to doubled CO2 depends on the strength of the ocean heat transport due to feedbacks between the ocean and subtropical marine stratus clouds and the water vapor greenhouse effect. In this model, the results are the same whether the ocean heat transports are determined interactively or are fixed. Some recent studies have suggested that an increased meridional overturning in the ocean due to changes in the zonally asymmetric circulation can reduce the sensitivity of the tropical climate to increased CO2. It is found that, in equilibrium, this is not that case, but rather an increase in ocean heat transport, which involves increased equatorial upwelling, actually warms the tropical climate.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACTArctic sea ice was observed to be at a new record minimum in September 2012. Following this summer minimum, northern Eurasia and much of North America experienced severe winter weather during the winter of 2012/2013. A statistical model that used Eurasian snow cover as its main predictor successfully forecast the observed cold winter temperatures. We propose that the large melting of Arctic sea ice may be related to the rapid advance of snow cover, similar to the connection made in studies of past climates between low Arctic sea ice and enhanced continental snowfalls and glacial inception via ice sheet growth. Regressions between autumnal sea ice extent and Eurasian snow cover extent and Northern Hemisphere temperatures yield the characteristic "warm Arctic/cold continents" pattern. This pattern was observed during winter 2012/2013, and it is common among years with observed low autumn sea ice, rapid autumn snow cover advance, and a negative winter Arctic Oscillation. Dynamical models fail to capture this pattern, instead showing maximum warming over the Arctic Ocean and widespread winter warming over the adjacent continents. We suggest that the simulated widespread warming may be due to incorrect sea ice-atmosphere coupling, including an incorrect triggering of positive feedback between low sea ice and atmospheric convection, resulting in significant model errors that are evident in seasonal predictions and that potentially impact future climate change projections.}

Cloud optical property related components (from total water content, water/ice fraction and cloud thickness) remain remarkably stable.

The feedback strengths in the model are diagnosed by the response of top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes determined after substitution of fields from the ``perturbed'' climate into the ``control.'' Total feedback is divided into terms due to water vapour, lapse rate, surface temperature, and clouds (in turn analysed in terms of cloud amount, height and types). The ``standard experiment'' prescribes a globally uniform SST perturbation with fixed soil moisture. Four additional experiments vary the number of model vertical levels, the pattern of SST changes, the convection scheme, and the soil moisture. The SST pattern change chosen follows that of an equilibrium 2\texttimes CO2 experiment, which shows polar amplification of the surface warming. Variations in the clear sky sensitivity of the model are shown to depend primarily on changes in the long wave response due to competing (positive) water vapor and (generally negative) lapse rate feedbacks. Results here indicate that these feedbacks may be very different for differing experimental boundary conditions. The long wave feedback due to cloud amount changes is negative in all experiments, due to a very consistent decrease in high and middle cloud fractions. Conversely, cloud height feedback is positive due to a general increase in the altitude of (particularly high) cloud. Cloud height feedback is very sensitive to the choice of the convection scheme and to the change in vertical resolution. Greatest changes in the strength of the short wave cloud feedback results from modifications to the soil moisture specification and the convection scheme. The results here indicate that large differences in cloud feedback may be diagnosed from a single model, even without changes being made to the cloud parametrization. The value of the sensitivity can thus be expected to be a function not only of the physical parametrizations chosen for the model (e.g. the penetrative convection scheme), but also of the details of the manner in which the experiment was performed (e.g. SST and soil moisture specifications). The TOA radiation perturbation analysis method proves to be a powerful technique for diagnosing and understanding the physical processes responsible for the range in climate sensitivity found between the experiments.},

Many attempts have been made to try to characterize and predict it, thus several physical indices have been proposed in literature during the last decade. Among these and for tropical environments, this study focuses on saturation fraction and gross moist stability, which are a measure of water vapor atmospheric columnar saturation, and an estimation of the convective behavior through the relation of its forcing and response, respectively. For the midlatitude, Mediterranean convection, the convective adjustment timescale {$\tau$}c has been introduced, which is an estimation of the convective equilibrium of the environment with the large scale. This paper tests the idea of a potential suitability of the tropical indices in a continuously-warming Mediterranean atmosphere, by testing them for the set of severe rainfall events that hit Italy from January 2007 to February 2009. In another study, those events have already been successfully classified into two categories showing equilibrium (type 1) or non-equilibrium (type 2) conditions, by using the convective adjustment timescale {$\tau$}c. Our results indicate that the classification based on such convective equilibrium criterion shows interesting differences in the saturation fraction against rain rates between the two event types, while their mean normalized gross moist stability turns out to be near zero for both and thus shows no tendency for the different flow regimes. Saturation fraction appears to vary somewhat with time, revealing a seasonality with an apparent maximum during summer\textendash autumn.},

For this purpose, radiative-convective equilibrium simulations are run with a general circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer, and several types of perturbations are imposed to the ocean-atmosphere system. Convective aggregation turns out to be much more sensitive to temperature in coupled experiments than in prescribed SST experiments. But changes in convective aggregation induced by a doubling of the CO2 concentration are always smaller than changes associated with the transition from a non-aggregated to an aggregated state. If aggregation changes were acting alone, they would exert a strong negative feedback on global mean surface temperature. However, in a coupled framework, aggregation changes interact with the SST and generate SST gradients that strengthen the positive low-cloud feedback associated with changes in SST pattern. This overcompensates the negative feedback due to aggregation changes and leads to a larger equilibrium climate sensitivity than in the absence of SST gradients. Although this effect might be model specific, interactions between convective aggregation and the spatial distribution of SST appear crucial to assess the impact of convective aggregation on climate sensitivity.},

We review the scientific evidence behind three leading hypotheses on the influence of Arctic changes on mid-latitude summer weather: Weakened storm tracks, shifted jet streams, and amplified quasi-stationary waves. We show that interactions between Arctic teleconnections and other remote and regional feedback processes could lead to more persistent hot-dry extremes in the mid-latitudes.

  abstract = {The recent decade has seen an exceptional number of high-impact summer extremes in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Many of these events were associated with anomalous jet stream circulation patterns characterized by persistent high-amplitude quasi-stationary Rossby waves. Two mechanisms have recently been proposed that could provoke such patterns: (i) a weakening of the zonal mean jets and (ii) an amplification of quasi-stationary waves by resonance between free and forced waves in midlatitude waveguides. Based upon spectral analysis of the midtroposphere wind field, we show that the persistent jet stream patterns were, in the first place, due to an amplification of quasi-stationary waves with zonal wave numbers 6\textendash 8. However, we also detect a weakening of the zonal mean jet during these events; thus both mechanisms appear to be important. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomalous circulation regimes lead to persistent surface weather conditions and therefore to midlatitude synchronization of extreme heat and rainfall events on monthly timescales. The recent cluster of resonance events has resulted in a statistically significant increase in the frequency of high-amplitude quasi-stationary waves of wave numbers 7 and 8 in July and August. We show that this is a robust finding that holds for different pressure levels and reanalysis products. We argue that recent rapid warming in the Arctic and associated changes in the zonal mean zonal wind have created favorable conditions for double jet formation in the extratropics, which promotes the development of resonant flow regimes.},

Atmospheric dynamics and radiation play different roles in controlling the total atmospheric heat transport (AHT) and its partitioning into components associated with eddies and mean meridional circulations. This work focuses on two specific controls: a radiative one, atmospheric radiative temperature tendencies; and a dynamic one, planetary rotation rate. We use an idealized grey radiation model to employ a novel framework to lock the radiative temperature tendency and total AHT to climatological values, even while the rotation rate is varied. This setup allows for a systematic study of the effects of radiative tendency and rotation rate on AHT. We find that rotation rate controls the latitudinal extent of the Hadley cell and the heat transport efficiency of eddies. Both rotation rate and radiative tendency influence the strength of the Hadley cell and the strength of equator-pole energy differences that are important for AHT by eddies. These two controls do not always operate independently and can reinforce or dampen each other. In addition, we examine how individual AHT components, which vary with latitude, sum to a total AHT that varies smoothly with latitude. At slow rotation rates the mean meridional circulation is most important in ensuring total AHT varies smoothly with latitude, while eddies are most important at rotation rates similar to, and faster than, the Earth's.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Here the nature of the linkage between blocks and the climate patterns is explored by using the ERA-40 re-analysis data set to examine (1) their temporal and spatial correlation and (2) the interrelationship between blocks and the NAO/PNA.

An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis points to a significant influence of blocking upon the NAO pattern (identifiable as the leading EOF in the Euro-Atlantic), and a temporal analysis indicates that long-lasting blocks are associated with the development of negative NAO/PNA index values throughout their life-time. In addition an indication of a cause-and effect relationship is set-out for the North Atlantic linkage.},

Blocks are viewed as large amplitude, long-lasting, and negative potential vorticity (PV) anomalies located beneath the dynamical tropopause. The derived climatology [based on the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40)] provides a concise, coherent, and illuminating description of the main physical characteristics of blocks and the accompanying linear trends. The latitude\textendash longitude distribution of blocking frequency captures the standard bimodal geographical distribution with major peaks over the North Atlantic and eastern North Pacific in all four seasons. The accompanying pattern for the age distribution, the genesis\textendash lysis regions, and the track of blocks reveals that 1) younger blocks (1\textendash 4 days) are more prevalent at lower latitudes whereas significantly older blocks (up to 12 days) are located at higher latitudes; 2) genesis is confined predominantly to the two major ocean basins and in a zonal band between 40\textdegree{} and 50\textdegree N latitude, whereas lysis is more dispersed but with clear preference to higher latitudes; and 3) the general northeastward\textendash west-northwest movement of blocks in the genesis\textendash lysis phase also exhibits subtle seasonal and intra- and interbasin differences. Examination of the intensity and spatial-scale changes during the blocking life cycle suggests that in the mean a block's evolution is independent of the genesis region and its eventual duration. A novel analysis of blocking trends reveals significant negative trends in winter over Greenland and in spring over the North Pacific. It is shown that the changes over Greenland are linked to the number of blocking episodes, whereas a neighboring trend signal to the south is linked to higher-frequency anticyclonic systems. Furthermore, evidence is adduced that changes in blocking frequency contribute seminally to tropopause height trends.},

We discuss example profiles with and without an atmospheric window and show that the sensitivity of surface temperature to forcing depends on the nature of the forcing, with greatest sensitivity to radiative forcing by increased optical thickness and least sensitivity to increased atmospheric heat transport.

We show that the size of {$\tau$}C is an intrinsic property of the coupling between the atmosphere and surface, and not a result of the thermal inertia of the surface alone. When the surface heat capacity is low, {$\tau$}C can be several times longer than expected, due to the effects of moisture on the effective heat capacity of the atmosphere. We also show that the theoretical expression for {$\tau$}C is a good predictor of best fit exponential relaxation time scales in a single-column model with full physics, across a range of surface temperatures and surface heat capacities.},

This problem owes partly to the scale separation between large-scale tropical dynamics ( km) and convective dynamics ( km), which generally requires parameterizing convection in models that resolve large-scale dynamics, or parameterizing (or omitting) large-scale dynamics in models that permit convection. Here we discuss simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) across a wide range of surface temperatures in long-channel geometry\textemdash where the domain size and resolution marginally resolve both large-scale dynamics and convection. Self-aggregation of convection in these simulations spontaneously produces realistic dynamical regimes of large-scale vertical motion. The circulation weakens with surface warming but changes in the degree of self-aggregation depend on the metric that is used; there is no obvious trend in aggregation with warming. Surface warming causes an upward shift and decrease in area of high clouds, and a sharp decline in midlevel clouds, but no systematic trend in low cloud cover. We introduce a method for approximate radiative kernel feedback analysis in RCE, and apply it to both simulations in long-channel geometry and in a smaller square domain. The kernel-corrected cloud feedback is positive but its magnitude varies across temperatures. Compared to simulations that do not have aggregation, there is a more negative net feedback due to the effects of aggregation on relative humidity and cloud cover. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that self-aggregation moderately reduces climate sensitivity.},

Recent numerical modeling by Mrowiec et al., however, challenged this conventional wisdom by finding the formation of axisymmetric dry tropical cyclones in dry radiative\textendash convective equilibrium (RCE). This paper addresses ensuing questions about the stability of dry tropical cyclones in 3D, the moist\textendash dry vortex transition, and whether existing theories for intensity, size, and structure apply to dry cyclones. A convection-permitting model is used to simulate rotating 3D RCE, with surface wetness (0\textendash 1) and surface temperature (240\textendash 300 K) smoothly varying between dry and moist states. Tropical cyclones spontaneously form and persist for tens of days in both moist and dry/cold states, as well as part of the relatively moist/warm intermediate parameter space. As the surface is dried or cooled, cyclones weaken, both in absolute terms and relative to their potential intensities. Dry and semidry cyclones have smaller outer radii but similar-sized or larger convective centers compared to moist cyclones, consistent with existing structural theory. Strikingly, spontaneous cyclogenesis fails to occur at moderately low surface wetness values and intermediate surface temperatures of 250\textendash 270 K. Simulations with time-varying surface moisture and sea surface temperatures indicate this range of parameter space is a barrier to spontaneous genesis but not cyclone existence. Dry and semidry tropical cyclones in rotating RCE provide a compelling model system to further our understanding of real moist tropical cyclones.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The calculated precipitation rate over the island can be more than double the domain average value, with island rainfall occurring primarily in an intense, regular thunderstorm system that forms in the afternoon to early evening each day. Island size affects the magnitude of simulated island rainfall enhancement, the intensity of the convection, and the timing of the rainfall maximum relative to solar noon. A combination of dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms leads to a monotonic enhancement of domain-averaged tropospheric temperature with increasing fraction of island surface, which may contribute to localization of ascent over the Maritime Continent and its relationship to the Walker Circulation.},

We use an idealized single-column atmospheric model across a range of conditions to study the polar night process of air mass transformation from high-latitude maritime air, with a prescribed initial temperature profile, to much colder high-latitude continental air. We find that a low-cloud feedback\textemdash consisting of a robust increase in the duration of optically thick liquid clouds with warming of the initial state\textemdash slows radiative cooling of the surface and amplifies continental warming. This low-cloud feedback increases the continental surface air temperature by roughly two degrees for each degree increase of the initial maritime surface air temperature, effectively suppressing Arctic air formation. The time it takes for the surface air temperature to drop below freezing increases nonlinearly to {$\sim$}10 d for initial maritime surface air temperatures of 20 \textdegree C. These results, supplemented by an analysis of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 climate model runs that shows large increases in cloud water path and surface cloud longwave forcing in warmer climates, suggest that the ``lapse rate feedback'' in simulations of anthropogenic climate change may be related to the influence of low clouds on the stratification of the lower troposphere. The results also indicate that optically thick stratus cloud decks could help to maintain frost-free winter continental interiors in equable climates.},

Recent work proposed that, in a warmer climate, increasing low-cloud optical thickness of maritime air advected over high-latitude landmasses during polar night could suppress the formation of Arctic air masses, amplifying winter warming over continents and sea ice. But this mechanism was based on single-column simulations that could not assess the role of fractional cloud cover change. This paper presents two-dimensional cloud-resolving model simulations that support the single-column model results: low-cloud optical thickness and duration increase strongly with initial air temperature, slowing the surface cooling rate as the climate is warmed. The cloud-resolving model cools less at the surface than the single-column model, and the sensitivity of its cooling to warmer initial temperatures is also higher, because it produces cloudier atmospheres with stronger lower-tropospheric mixing and distributes cloud-top cooling over a deeper atmospheric layer with larger heat capacity. Resolving larger-scale cloud turbulence has the greatest impact on the microphysics schemes that best represent general observed features of mixed-phase clouds, increasing their sensitivity to climate warming. These findings support the hypothesis that increasing insulation of the high-latitude land surface by low clouds in a warmer world could act as a strong positive feedback in future climate change and suggest studying Arctic air formation in a three-dimensional climate model.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Geochemical data and models suggest a positive correlation between carbon dioxide changes and climate during the last 540 m.y. The most dramatic exception to this correlation involves the Late Ordovician (440 Ma) glaciation, which occurred at a time when CO2 levels may have been much greater than present (14\textendash 16X?). Since decreased solar luminosity at that time only partially offset increased radiative forcing from CO2, some other factor needs to be considered to explain the glaciation. Prior work with energy balance models (EBMs) suggested that the unique geographic configuration of Gondwanaland at that time may have resulted in a small area of parameter space permitting permanent snow cover and higher CO2 levels. However, the crude snow and sea ice parameterizations in the EBM left these conclusions open to further scrutiny. Herein we present results from four experiments with the GENESIS general circulation model with CO2 levels 14X greater than present, solar luminosity reduced 4.5\%, and an orbital configuration set for minimum summer insolation receipt. We examined the effects of different combinations of ocean heat transport and topography on high-latitude snow cover on Gondwanaland. For the no-elevation simulations we failed to simulate permanent summer snow cover. However, for the slightly elevated topography cases (300\textendash 500 m), permanent summer snow cover occurs where geological data indicate the Ordovician ice sheet was present. These results support the hypothesis based on EBM studies. Further results indicate that although average runoff per grid point increases substantially for the Ordovician runs, the decreased land area results in global runoff 10\textendash 30\% less than present, with largest runoff reductions for flat topography. This response has implications for CO2-runoff/weathering parameterizations in geochemical models. Finally, simulated tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are the same or only marginally warmer than present. This result is consistent with evidence from other warm time intervals indicating small changes in tropical SSTs during time of high CO2.},

  abstract = {The mass extinction event that occurred at the close of the Permian Period (\textasciitilde 252million years ago) represents the most severe biodiversity loss in the ocean of the Phanerozoic. The links between the global carbon cycle, climate change and mass extinction are complex and involve a whole range of often inter-related geochemical, biological, ecologic and climatic factors. It has become widely accepted that the end-Permian mass extinction was associated with a global warming event, because the age of the Siberian Trap eruption, a potentially massive source of carbon dioxide, coincides within error with the extinction event. However, geologic data that are in support of this global warming event are relatively sparse. The chain of events and the causal relationship between the eruption of Siberian Traps and mass extinction is not well established. Global warming, in particular, has only been reported from limited proxy data and climate models, for which the pCO2 in the atmosphere just before and during the end-Permian extinction event is poorly known. This study critically assesses both the proxy climate data and the existing paleoclimate simulations with the goals of assessing our current understanding of the link between mass extinction and climate change and providing some guidance for future studies. Proxies indicate that prior to the end-Permian extinction event tropical sea surface temperatures ranged from \textasciitilde 22 to 25\textdegree C, and possible pCO2 values ranged from \textasciitilde 500 to \textasciitilde 4000ppm before the extinction event. During the peak extinction, tropical temperatures rose up to \textasciitilde 30\textdegree C while pCO2 perhaps increased up to \textasciitilde 8000ppm. Climate models that use different pre-event pCO2 values show similar amount of CO2 doubling to replicate the observed carbon isotope excursions. We find that the temperature anomaly during the end-Permian extinction is consistent with \textasciitilde 1.5 doublings of atmospheric pCO2, and that the implied climate sensitivity is 5\textendash 6\textdegree C, within the upper range of values produced by climate models.},

The improved mean jet position cannot be explained by changes in the simulated sea surface temperatures. Instead, we find indications that increased horizontal grid resolution in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 has contributed to the higher mean jet latitude, and thus to the reduced jet shift under CO2 forcing. These results imply that CMIP6 models can provide more realistic projections of SH climate change.},

By analyzing data and model simulations, here we show that large AA occurs only from October to April and only over areas with significant sea-ice loss. AA largely disappears when Arctic sea ice is fixed or melts away. Periods with larger AA are associated with larger sea-ice loss, and models with bigger sea-ice loss produce larger AA. Increased outgoing longwave radiation and heat fluxes from the newly opened waters cause AA, whereas all other processes can only indirectly contribute to AA by melting sea-ice. We conclude that sea-ice loss is necessary for the existence of large AA and that models need to simulate Arctic sea ice realistically in order to correctly simulate Arctic warming under increasing CO2.},

  abstract = {Abstract To evaluate the performance of version 2 of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM2) in simulating the diurnal cycle and to diagnose the deficiencies in underlying model physics, 10 years of 3-hourly data from a CCSM2 control run are analyzed for global and large-scale features of diurnal variations in surface air temperature, surface pressure, upper-air winds, cloud amount, and precipitation. The model-simulated diurnal variations are compared with available observations, most of which were derived from 3-hourly synoptic reports and some new results are reported for surface air temperatures. The CCSM2 reproduces most of the large-scale tidal variations in surface pressure and upper-air winds, although it overestimates the diurnal pressure tide by 20\%\textendash 50\% over low-latitude land and underestimates it over most oceans, the Rockies, and other midlatitude land areas. The CCSM2 captures the diurnal amplitude (1\textdegree\textendash 6\textdegree C) and phase [peak at 1400\textendash 1600 local solar time (LST)] of surface air temperature over land, but over ocean the amplitude is too small ({$\leq$}0.2\textdegree C). The CCSM2 overestimates the mean total cloud amount by 10\%\textendash 20\% of the sky from {$\sim$}15\textdegree S to 15\textdegree N during both December\textendash{} January\textendash February (DJF) and June\textendash July\textendash August (JJA) and over northern mid- and high-latitude land areas in DJF, whereas it underestimates the cloud amount by 10\%\textendash 30\% in the subtropics and parts of the midlatitudes. Over the marine stratocumulus regions west to the continents, the diagnostic cloud scheme in the CCSM2 underestimates the mean stratocumulus amount by 10\%\textendash 30\% and does not simulate the observed large diurnal variations ({$\sim$}3\%\textendash 10\%) in the marine stratocumulus clouds even when driven by observational data. In the CCSM2, warm-season daytime moist convection over land starts prematurely around 0800 LST, about 4 hours too early compared with observations, and plateaus from 1100 to 1800 LST, in contrast to a sharp peak around 1600\textendash 1700 LST in observations. The premature initiation of convection prevents convective available potential energy (CAPE) from accumulating in the morning and early afternoon and intense convection from occurring in the mid to late afternoon. As a result of the extended duration of daytime convection over land, the CCSM2 rains too frequently at reduced intensity despite the fairly realistic patterns of rainy days with precipitation {$>$}1 mm day-1. Furthermore, the convective versus nonconvective precipitation ratio is too high in the model as deep convection removes atmospheric moisture prematurely. The simulated diurnal cycle of precipitation is too weak over the oceans, especially for convective precipitation. These results suggest that substantial improvements are desirable in the CCSM2 in simulating cloud amount, initiation of warm-season deep convection over land, and in the diurnal cycle in sea surface temperatures.},

  abstract = {Global precipitation data sets with high spatial and temporal resolution are needed for many applications, but they were unavailable before the recent creation of several such satellite products. Here, we evaluate four different satellite data sets of hourly or 3-hourly precipitation (namely CMORPH, PERSIANN, TRMM 3B42 and a microwave-only product referred to as MI) by comparing the spatial patterns in seasonal mean precipitation amount, daily precipitation frequency and intensity, and the diurnal and semidiurnal cycles among them and with surface synoptic weather reports. We found that these high-resolution products show spatial patterns in seasonal mean precipitation amount comparable to other monthly products for the low- and mid-latitudes, and the mean daily precipitation frequency and intensity maps are similar among these pure satellite-based precipitation data sets and consistent with the frequency derived using weather reports over land. The satellite data show that spatial variations in mean precipitation amount come largely from precipitation frequency rather than intensity, and that the use of satellite infrared (IR) observations to improve sampling does not change the mean frequency, intensity and the diurnal cycle significantly. Consistent with previous studies, the satellite data show that sub-daily variations in precipitation are dominated by the 24-h cycle, which has an afternoon\textendash evening maximum and mean-to-peak amplitude of 30\textendash 100\% of the daily mean in precipitation amount over most land areas during summer. Over most oceans, the 24-h harmonic has a peak from midnight to early morning with an amplitude of 10\textendash 30\% during both winter and summer. These diurnal results are broadly consistent with those based on the weather reports, although the time of maximum in the satellite precipitation is a few hours later (especially for TRMM and PERSIANN) than that in the surface observations over most land and ocean, and it is closer to the phase of showery precipitation from the weather reports. The TRMM and PERSIANN precipitation shows a spatially coherent time of maximum around 0300\textendash 0600 local solar time (LST) for a weak (amplitude {$<$}20\%) semi-diurnal (12-h) cycle over most mid- to high-latitudes, comparable to 0400\textendash 0600 LST in the surface data. The satellite data also confirm the notion that the diurnal cycle of precipitation amount comes mostly from its frequency rather than its intensity over most low and mid-latitudes, with the intensity has only about half of the strength of the diurnal cycle in the frequency and amount. The results suggest that these relatively new precipitation products can be useful for many applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ocean component of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4) is described, and its solutions from the twentieth-century (20C) simulations are documented in comparison with observations and those of CCSM3. The improvements to the ocean model physical processes include new parameterizations to represent previously missing physics and modifications of existing parameterizations to incorporate recent new developments. In comparison with CCSM3, the new solutions show some significant improvements that can be attributed to these model changes. These include a better equatorial current structure, a sharper thermocline, and elimination of the cold bias of the equatorial cold tongue all in the Pacific Ocean; reduced sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity biases along the North Atlantic Current path; and much smaller potential temperature and salinity biases in the near-surface Pacific Ocean. Other improvements include a global-mean SST that is more consistent with the present-day observations due to a different spinup procedure from that used in CCSM3. Despite these improvements, many of the biases present in CCSM3 still exist in CCSM4. A major concern continues to be the substantial heat content loss in the ocean during the preindustrial control simulation from which the 20C cases start. This heat loss largely reflects the top of the atmospheric model heat loss rate in the coupled system, and it essentially determines the abyssal ocean potential temperature biases in the 20C simulations. There is also a deep salty bias in all basins. As a result of this latter bias in the deep North Atlantic, the parameterized overflow waters cannot penetrate much deeper than in CCSM3.},

In addition, an evaluation of a pair of CESM2 long preindustrial control and historical ensemble simulations is presented. These simulations were performed using the nominal 1\textdegree{} horizontal resolution configuration of the coupled model with both the ``low-top'' (40 km, with limited chemistry) and ``high-top'' (130 km, with comprehensive chemistry) versions of the atmospheric component. CESM2 contains many substantial science and infrastructure improvements and new capabilities since its previous major release, CESM1, resulting in improved historical simulations in comparison to CESM1 and available observations. These include major reductions in low-latitude precipitation and shortwave cloud forcing biases; better representation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation; better El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation-related teleconnections; and a global land carbon accumulation trend that agrees well with observationally based estimates. Most tropospheric and surface features of the low- and high-top simulations are very similar to each other, so these improvements are present in both configurations. CESM2 has an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 5.1\textendash 5.3 \textdegree C, larger than in CESM1, primarily due to a combination of relatively small changes to cloud microphysics and boundary layer parameters. In contrast, CESM2's transient climate response of 1.9\textendash 2.0 \textdegree C is comparable to that of CESM1. The model outputs from these and many other simulations are available to the research community, and they represent CESM2's contributions to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6.},

This is virtually always estimated in a version with a slab model for the upper ocean. The question is whether this estimate is accurate for the full climate model version, which includes a full-depth ocean component. This question has been answered for the low-resolution version of the Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3). The answer is that the equilibrium climate sensitivity using the full-depth ocean model is 0.14\textdegree C higher than that using the slab ocean model, which is a small increase. In addition, these sensitivity estimates have a standard deviation of nearly 0.1\textdegree C because of interannual variability. These results indicate that the standard practice of using a slab ocean model does give a good estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity of the full CCSM3. Another question addressed is whether the effective climate sensitivity is an accurate estimate of the equilibrium climate sensitivity. Again the answer is yes, provided that at least 150 yr of data from the doubled carbon dioxide run are used.},

The condensation temperature is an important parameter, which has got some glaciological applications. The temperature effect (the {$\Delta$}'s decreasing with temperature) together with varying evaporation and exchange appear in the ``amount effect'' as high {$\Delta$}'s in sparse rain. The relative deuterium-oxygen-18 fractionation is not quite simple. If the relative deviations from the standard water (S.M.O.W.) are called {$\Delta$}D and {$\Delta$}18, the best linear approximation is {$\Delta$}D = 8 {$\Delta$}18.Chapter 3 gives some qualitative considerations on non-equilibrium (fast) processes. Kinetic effects have heavy bearings upon the effective fractionation factors. Such effects have only been demonstrated clearly in evaporation processes, but may also influence condensation processes. The quantity d = {$\Delta$}D -8 {$\Delta$}18 is used as an index for non-equilibrium conditions.The stable isotope data from the world wide I.A.E.A.-W.M.O. precipitation survey are discussed in chapter 4. The unweighted mean annual composition of rain at tropical island stations fits the line {$\Delta$}D = 4.6 {$\Delta$}18 indicating a first stage equilibrium condensation from vapour evaporated in a non-equilibrium process. Regional characteristics appear in the weighted means.The Northern hemisphere continental stations, except African and Near East, fit the line {$\Delta$}D = 8.0 {$\Delta$}18 + 10 as far as the weighted means are concerned ({$\Delta$}D = 8.1 {$\Delta$}18 + 11 for the unweighted) corresponding to an equilibrium Rayleigh condensation from vapour, evaporated in a non-equilibrium process from S.M.O.W. The departure from equilibrium vapour seems even higher in the rest of the investigated part of the world.At most stations the {$\Delta$}D and varies linearily with {$\Delta$}18 with a slope close to 8, only at two stations higher than 8, at several lower than 8 (mainly connected with relatively dry climates).Considerable variations in the isotopic composition of monthly precipitation occur at most stations. At low latitudes the amount effect accounts for the variations, whereas seasonal variation at high latitudes is ascribed to the temperature effect. Tokyo is an example of a mid latitude station influenced by both effects.Some possible hydrological applications are outlined in chapter 5.},

Despite surface asymmetries, top of the atmosphere temporally \& hemispherically averaged reflected solar irradiance R appears symmetric over Northern/Southern hemispheres. This is confirmed with the use of surrogate time-series, which provides margins of 0.1{$\pm$}0.28Wm-2 for possible hemispheric differences supported by Clouds and Earth's Radiant System data. R time-series are further analyzed by decomposition into a seasonal (yearly and half yearly) cycle and residuals. Variability in the reflected solar irradiance is almost entirely (99\%) due to the seasonal variations, mostly due to seasonal variations in insolation. The residuals of hemispherically averaged R are not only small, but also indistinguishable from noise, and thus not correlated across hemispheres. This makes yearly and sub-yearly timescales unlikely as the basis for a symmetry-establishing mechanism. The residuals however contain a global trend that is large, as compared to expected albedo feedbacks. It is also hemispherically symmetric, and thus indicates the possibility of a symmetry enforcing mechanism at longer timescales. To pinpoint precisely which parts of the Earth system establish the hemispheric symmetry, we create an energetically consistent cloud-albedo field from the data. We show that the surface albedo asymmetry is compensated by asymmetries between clouds over extra-tropical oceans, with southern hemispheric storm-tracks being 11\% cloudier than their northern hemisphere counterparts. This again indicates that, assuming the albedo symmetry is not a result of chance, its mechanism likely operates on large temporal and spatial scales.},

The decomposition of the water vapor budget in the tropical lower stratosphere (TLS, 10\textdegree S\textendash 30\textdegree N, and 17\textendash 20 km altitude) indicates that the average moistening (+21 Tg) over the simulated 40-day period is the result of the combined effect of the vertical water vapor transport from the troposphere (+27 Tg), microphysical phase changes and subgrid-scale transport (+2 Tg), partly compensated by horizontal water vapor export (-8 Tg). The very deep convective systems, explicitly represented thanks to the employed 2.5 km grid spacing of the model, are identified using the very low Outgoing Longwave Radiation of their cold cloud tops. The water vapor budget reveals that the vertical transport, the sublimation and the subgrid-scale transport at their top contribute together to 11\% of the water vapor mass input into the TLS.},

Individual updrafts, defined as 3D objects with vertical velocity above 10 m s-1 are identified. Among the 20 000 updrafts formed during the most intense phase, only a dozen were more than 4 km tall. The two tallest updrafts accounted for more than 90\% of the total vertical mass flux through the tropical tropopause layer. Their locations were determined by low-level convergence lines first created by the sea breeze in the morning, then enhanced by cold pools due to cumulus congestus. They finally reinforced each other as they moved inland and intersected. The two tallest updrafts that overshot the tropopause were contrasted with those occurring 1 h earlier and later. They presented larger widths (up to 8 km), greater buoyancy (up to 0.1 m s-2), stronger vertical velocities (up to 50 m s-1), and larger hydrometeor contents (more than 10 g kg-1). They kept their core weakly diluted on their way to the stratosphere with an entrainment rate as low as 0.08 km-1. Both the low-level convergence lines intensified by cold pools and the reduced mixing in the troposphere were found to be the determinant for the transition from deep to very deep convection.},

  abstract = {Abstract Overshoots are convective air parcels that rise beyond their level of neutral buoyancy. A giga-large-eddy simulation (100-m cubic resolution) of ``Hector the Convector,'' a deep convective system that regularly forms in northern Australia, is analyzed to identify overshoots and quantify the effect of hydration of the stratosphere. In the simulation, 1507 individual overshoots were identified, and 46 of them were tracked over more than 10 min. Hydration of the stratosphere occurs through a sequence of mechanisms: overshoot penetration into the stratosphere, followed by entrainment of stratospheric air and then by efficient turbulent mixing between the air in the overshoot and the entrained warmer air, leaving the subsequent mixed air at about the maximum overshooting altitude. The time scale of these mechanisms is about 1 min. Two categories of overshoots are distinguished: those that significantly hydrate the stratosphere and those that have little direct hydration effect. The former reach higher altitudes and hence entrain and mix with air that has higher potential temperatures. The resulting mixed air has higher temperatures and higher saturation mixing ratios. Therefore, a greater amount of the hydrometeors carried by the original overshoot sublimates to form a persistent vapor-enriched layer. This makes the maximum overshooting altitude the key prognostic for the parameterization of deep convection to represent the correct overshoot transport. One common convection parameterization is tested, and the results suggest that the overshoot downward acceleration due to negative buoyancy is too large relative to that predicted by the numerical simulations and needs to be reduced.},

  abstract = {The simulation and prediction of winter Northern Hemisphere atmospheric blocking in the seasonal prediction systems from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is analysed. Blocking statistics from the operational November-initialised seasonal hindcasts are evaluated in three generations of models: System3, System4, and System5 (SEAS5). Improvements in the climatological representation of blocking are observed in the most recent model configurations, with reduced bias over North Pacific and Greenland. Minor progress is seen over the European sector, where SEAS5 still underestimates the observed blocking frequency. SEAS5 blocking interannual variability is underestimated too and is proportional to the climatological frequency, highlighting that a negative bias in the blocking frequency implies an underestimation of the interannual variance. SEAS5 predictive skill and signal-to-noise ratio remain low, but interesting positive results are found over Western and Central Europe. Improved forecasts with reduced ensemble spread are obtained during El Ni\~no years, especially at low latitudes. Complementary experiments show that the statistics of blocking are improved following atmospheric and oceanic resolution increase. Conversely, they remain largely insensitive to coupled model sea-surface temperature (SST) errors. On the other hand, the implementation of stochastic parameterisations tends to displace blocking activity equatorward. Finally, by comparing seasonal hindcasts with climate runs using the same model, we highlight that the largest contributors to the chronic underestimation of blocking are persistent errors in the atmospheric model. It is also shown that SST errors have a larger impact on blocking bias in climate runs than in seasonal runs, and that increased ocean model resolution contributes to improved blocking more effectively in climate runs. Seasonal forecasts can thus be considered a suitable test-bed for model development targeting blocking improvement in climate models.},

More fossil-fuel-intensive scenarios9 result in even greater acceleration. Ice-sheet retreat initiated by the thinning and loss of buttressing ice shelves continues for centuries, regardless of bedrock and sea-level feedback mechanisms10\textendash 12 or geoengineered carbon dioxide reduction.

Relative to the reanalysis, the ensemble-mean 300-hPa Atlantic jet is too zonally extended and located too far equatorward in GCMs. The Pacific jet varies significantly between modeling groups, with large biases in the vicinity of the jet exit region that cancel in the ensemble mean. After seeking relationships between twentieth-century model wind biases and 1) the internal modes of jet variability or 2) tropical sea surface temperatures (SSTs), it is found that biases in upper-level winds are strongly related to an ENSO-like pattern in winter-mean tropical Pacific Ocean SST biases. The spatial structure of the leading modes of variability of the upper-level jet in the twentieth century is found to be accurately modeled in all 17 GCMs. Also, it is shown that Pacific model biases in the longitude of EOFs 1 and 2 are strongly linked to the modeled longitude of the Pacific jet exit, indicating that the improved characterization of the mean state of the Pacific jet may positively impact the modeled variability. This work suggests that improvements in model portrayal of the tropical Pacific mean state may significantly advance the portrayal of the mean state of the Pacific and Atlantic jets, which will consequently improve the modeled jet stream variability in the Pacific. To complement these findings, a companion paper examines the twenty-first-century GCM projections of the nonzonally averaged NH jet streams.},

While both responses are evident in phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) ensemble mean twenty-first-century projections, uncertainty in the poleward shift response is large enough that even the sign of the shift is not consistent among all models, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. The present analysis finds that twenty-first-century projections of the ensemble mean zonal wind change at 300 hPa predict a weakening and poleward expansion of the Pacific jet and an overall expansion of the Atlantic jet. In contrast with the direct zonal mean climate change signal of increasing midlatitude upper-level winds, zonal winds are projected to decrease in the core of the Pacific and Atlantic jets, with increasing zonal winds located primarily in the jet exit regions and the meridional flanks of the jets. Uncertainties in SST changes from the twentieth century to the twenty-first century between models are shown to impact modeled Northern Hemisphere jet stream changes. In particular, El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation\textendash like mean winter SST changes explain 30\% of intermodel variance of midlatitude zonal wind compared to the 8\% explained by the domain-averaged warming SST signal. This suggests that a reduction of uncertainty in the tropical Pacific SST response to global warming will significantly reduce uncertainty in the Northern Hemisphere zonal wind response to climate change.},

The CESM2 is the version of the CESM contributed to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We analyze changes in Arctic sea ice cover in two CESM2 configurations with differing atmospheric components: the CESM2(CAM6) and the CESM2(WACCM6). Over the historical period, the CESM2(CAM6) winter ice thickness distribution is biased thin, which leads to lower summer ice area compared to CESM2(WACCM6) and observations. In both CESM2 configurations, the timing of first ice-free conditions is insensitive to the choice of CMIP6 future emissions scenario. In fact, the probability of an ice-free Arctic summer remains low only if global warming stays below 1.5\textdegree C, which none of the CMIP6 scenarios achieve. By the end of the 21st century, the CESM2 simulates less ocean heat loss during the fall months compared to its previous version, delaying sea ice formation and leading to ice-free conditions for up to 8 months under the high emissions scenario. As a result, both CESM2 configurations exhibit an accelerated decline in winter and spring ice area, a behavior that had not been previously seen in CESM simulations. Differences in climate sensitivity and higher levels of atmospheric CO2 by 2100 in the CMIP6 high emissions scenario compared to its CMIP5 analog could explain why this winter ice loss was not previously simulated by the CESM.},

  abstract = {Abstract The early twenty-first century's warming trend of the full-depth global ocean is calculated by combining the analysis of Argo (top 2000 m) and repeat hydrography into a blended full-depth observing system. The surface-to-bottom temperature change over the last decade of sustained observation is equivalent to a heat uptake of 0.71 {$\pm$} 0.09 W m-2 applied over the surface of Earth, 90\% of it being found above 2000-m depth. The authors decompose the temperature trend pointwise into changes in isopycnal depth (heave) and temperature changes along an isopycnal (spiciness) to describe the mechanisms controlling the variability. The heave component dominates the global heat content increase, with the largest trends found in the Southern Hemisphere's extratropics (0\textendash 2000 m) highlighting a volumetric increase of subtropical mode waters. Significant heave-related warming is also found in the deep North Atlantic and Southern Oceans (2000\textendash 4000 m), reflecting a potential decrease in deep water mass renewal rates. The spiciness component shows its strongest contribution at intermediate levels (700\textendash 2000 m), with striking localized warming signals in regions of intense vertical mixing (North Atlantic and Southern Oceans). Finally, the agreement between the independent Argo and repeat hydrography temperature changes at 2000 m provides an overall good confidence in the blended heat content evaluation on global and ocean scales but also highlights basin-scale discrepancies between the two independent estimates. Those mismatches are largest in those basins with the largest heave signature (Southern Ocean) and reflect both the temporal and spatial sparseness of the hydrography sampling.},

  abstract = {Abstract The wintertime atmospheric circulation responses to observed patterns of North Atlantic sea surface temperature and sea ice cover trends in recent decades are studied by means of experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model. Here the relationship between the forced responses and the dominant pattern of internally generated atmospheric variability is focused on. The total response is partioned into a portion that projects onto the leading mode of internal variability (the indirect response) and a portion that is the residual from that projection (the direct response). This empirical decomposition yields physically meaningful patterns whose distinctive horizontal and vertical structures imply different governing mechanisms. The indirect response, which dominates the total geopotential height response, is hemispheric in scale with resemblance to the North Atlantic Oscillation or Northern Hemisphere annular mode, and equivalent barotropic in the vertical from the surface to the tropopause. In contrast, the direct response is localized to the vicinity of the surface thermal anomaly (SST or sea ice) and exhibits a baroclinic structure in the vertical, with a surface trough and upper-level ridge in the case of a positive heating anomaly, consistent with theoretical models of the linear baroclinic response to extratropical thermal forcing. Both components of the response scale linearly with respect to the amplitude of the forcing but nonlinearly with respect to the polarity of the forcing. The deeper vertical penetration of anomalous heating compared to cooling is suggested to play a role in the nonlinearity of the response to SST forcing.},

In both integrations, a repeating seasonal cycle of SSTs for 1980\textendash 99 was prescribed to isolate the impact of projected future sea ice loss. Note that greenhouse gas concentrations remained fixed at 1980\textendash 99 levels in both sets of experiments.

Air temperature and precipitation responses also maximize in winter, both over the Arctic Ocean and over the adjacent high-latitude continents. Snow depths increase over Siberia and northern Canada because of the enhanced winter precipitation. Atmospheric warming over the high-latitude continents is mainly confined to the boundary layer (below {$\sim$}850 hPa) and to regions with a strong low-level temperature inversion. Enhanced warm air advection by submonthly transient motions is the primary mechanism for the terrestrial warming. A significant large-scale atmospheric circulation response is found during winter, with a baroclinic (equivalent barotropic) vertical structure over the Arctic in November\textendash December (January\textendash March). This response resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in February only. Comparison with the fully coupled model reveals that Arctic sea ice loss accounts for most of the seasonal, spatial, and vertical structure of the high-latitude warming response to greenhouse gas forcing at the end of the twenty-first century.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Parallel experiments with different ocean model configurations (full-depth, slab, and no interactive ocean) allow the roles of dynamical and thermodynamic ocean feedbacks to be isolated. In the absence of ocean coupling, the atmospheric response to Arctic sea ice loss is confined to north of 30\textdegree N, consisting of a weakening and equatorward shift of the westerlies accompanied by lower tropospheric warming and enhanced precipitation at high latitudes. With ocean feedbacks, the response expands to cover the whole globe and exhibits a high degree of equatorial symmetry: the entire troposphere warms, the global hydrological cycle strengthens, and the intertropical convergence zones shift equatorward. Ocean dynamics are fundamental to producing this equatorially symmetric pattern of response to Arctic sea ice loss. Finally, the absence of a poleward shift of the wintertime Northern Hemisphere westerlies in CCSM4's response to greenhouse gas radiative forcing is shown to result from the competing effects of Arctic sea ice loss and greenhouse warming on the meridional temperature gradient in middle latitudes.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Using a simple model, we estimate that convection increases model extratropical water vapor at 380 K by 40\% but decreases model extratropical ozone by only a few percent, relative to what would occur without convection. In situ data show that this convective injection occurs up to at least {$\sim$}390 K. This raises the possibility that the convectively moistened air might travel isentropically to the tropics and ascend into the stratospheric overworld without passing through the cold point.

  abstract = {Abstract This study investigates potential biases between equilibrium climate sensitivity inferred from warming over the historical period (ECShist) and the climate system's true ECS (ECStrue). This paper focuses on two factors that could contribute to differences between these quantities. First is the impact of internal variability over the historical period: our historical climate record is just one of an infinity of possible trajectories, and these different trajectories can generate ECShist values 0.3 K below to 0.5 K above (5\%\textendash 95\% confidence interval) the average ECShist. Because this spread is due to unforced variability, I refer to this as the unforced pattern effect. This unforced pattern effect in the model analyzed here is traced to unforced variability in loss of sea ice, which affects the albedo feedback, and to unforced variability in warming of the troposphere, which affects the shortwave cloud feedback. There is also a forced pattern effect that causes ECShist to depart from ECStrue due to differences between today's transient pattern of warming and the pattern of warming at 2\texttimes CO2 equilibrium. Changes in the pattern of warming lead to a strengthening low-cloud feedback as equilibrium is approached in regions where surface warming is delayed: the Southern Ocean, eastern Pacific, and North Atlantic near Greenland. This forced pattern effect causes ECShist to be on average 0.2 K lower than ECStrue (\textasciitilde 8\%). The net effect of these two pattern effects together can produce an estimate of ECShist as much as 0.5 K below ECStrue.},

It is therefore essential that they are accurately quantified, monitored and simulated as realistically as possible over the Arctic regions. In the present study, the characteristics of inversions in terms of frequency and strength are quantified for the entire Arctic Ocean for summer and winter seasons of 2003 to 2008 using the AIRS data for the clear-sky conditions. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the inversion strength are also presented for every summer and winter month. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Our analysis shows that although the inversion frequency along the coastal regions of Arctic decreases from June to August, inversions are still seen in almost each profile retrieved over the inner Arctic region. In winter, inversions are ubiquitous and are also present in every profile analysed over the inner Arctic region. When averaged over the entire study area (70\textdegree{} N\textendash 90\textdegree{} N), the inversion frequency in summer ranges from 69 to 86\% for the ascending passes and 72\textendash 86\% for the descending passes. For winter, the frequency values are 88\textendash 91\% for the ascending passes and 89\textendash 92\% for the descending passes of AIRS/AQUA. The PDFs of inversion strength for the summer months are narrow and right-skewed (or positively skewed), while in winter, they are much broader. In summer months, the mean values of inversion strength for the entire study area range from 2.5 to 3.9 K, while in winter, they range from 7.8 to 8.9 K. The standard deviation of the inversion strength is double in winter compared to summer. The inversions in the summer months of 2007 were very strong compared to other years.

Failure of the Planck feedback to stabilize the climate is described by three generally independent phenomena: the super-greenhouse effect, the runaway greenhouse, and multiple equilibria of radiative-convective atmospheres. Here we use satellite observations and models to show that the existence of the super-greenhouse gives rise to a radiative-convective instability which is relevant to Earth's tropics. The super-greenhouse is caused by the low troposphere becoming optically thick, causing a positive feedback on near surface temperature and moisture, driving deep convection, column moistening, and reduced outgoing longwave radiation. Aspects of the runaway greenhouse physics are implicated, but a local runaway greenhouse is avoided. These results have implications for understanding the response of the tropics to a warming world.},

Among the moderate events, two classes are considered consisting in the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Ni\~no events and Central Pacific (CP) events. We first show that the observed SST variability across moderate El Ni\~no events (i.e. inter-event variability) is largest in the far eastern Pacific (east of \textasciitilde\,130\textdegree W) in the Austral winter prior to their peak, which is associated to either significant warm anomaly (moderate EP El Ni\~no) or an anomaly between weak warm and cold (moderate CP El Ni\~no) as reveals by the EOF analysis of the SST anomaly evolution during the development phase of El Ni\~no across the El Ni\~no years. Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of SST and wind stress anomalies across the El Ni\~no years further indicates that the inter-event SST variability is associated with an air\textendash sea mode explaining 31\% of the covariance between SST and wind stress. The associated SST pattern consists in SST anomalies developing along the coast of Ecuador in Austral fall and expanding westward as far as 130\textdegree W in Austral winter. The associated wind stress pattern features westerlies (easterlies) west of \textasciitilde\,130\textdegree W along the equator peaking around June\textendash August for EP (CP) El Ni\~no events. This air\textendash sea mode is interpreted as resulting from a developing seasonal Bjerknes feedback for EP El Ni\~no events since it is shown to be associated to a Kelvin wave response at its peak phase. However equatorial easterlies east of 130\textdegree W emerge in September that counters the growing SST anomalies associated to the air\textendash sea mode. These have been particularly active during both the 1972 and the 2015 El Ni\~no events. It is shown that the easterlies are connected to an off-equatorial southerly wind off the coast of Peru and Ecuador. The southerly wind is a response to the coastal SST anomalies off Peru developing from Austral fall. Implications of our results for the understanding of the seasonal ENSO dynamics and diversity are discussed in the light of the analysis of two global climate models simulating realistically ENSO diversity~(GFDL\_CM2.1 and CESM).},

This hypothesis is based on shallow water theory, which predicts that the zonal speed of propagation of such tropospheric equatorial modes is altered by the equivalent depth and the basic zonal flow. Localized space-time spectra are calculated to investigate how CCEW spectral peaks vary across the tropics and how they are affected by the variations in zonal wind observed geographically and by season. Doppler shifting by the basic state barotropic zonal flow is readily identified. Once this Doppler shifting is taken into account, the equivalent depths of CCEWs inferred from global power spectra are surprisingly uniform, both geographically and temporally. However, there are also detectable modulations that appear consistent with changes in vertical shear of the zonal flow, along with other shifts that are not as easily explained.},

In each integration, a wave of initially small amplitude is subjected to a different amount of vertical and meridional wind shear, with temperature and moisture fields constructed according to realistic constraints. Based on the evolution of this disturbance into monsoon depression\textendash like vortices, two features of the background environment emerge as important: the low-level gradient of moist static energy (MSE) and the low-level meridional shear. As the low-level MSE gradient steepens, the disturbance becomes stronger and produces more rain. This strengthening results from the interaction of the vortex with latent heat release by convection that is in turn organized by positive MSE advection in the northerly flow west of the vortex. In this region of advection, moister air from the north ascends along upward-sloping isentropes, driving moist convection. The disturbance also becomes stronger with increasing meridional shear, which makes the environment more barotropically unstable. The absence of either of these two features of the background environment prevents substantial growth of the disturbance. Our results suggest that monsoon depression growth in South Asia is fostered by the coexistence of a strong low-level MSE gradient with strong meridional wind shear associated with the monsoon trough.},

Each experiment is initialized with a small-amplitude wave that is allowed to grow within an environment representative of the South Asian monsoon. Comparing experiments with and without interactive surface heat fluxes, it is found that these fluxes enhance the growth of the simulated vortices. Without interactive surface fluxes, the strengthening period is short and the vortices fail to reach intensities characteristic of stronger monsoon depressions. Using a large set of experiments in which the vertical and meridional shear are systematically varied, it is found that surface heat fluxes enhance intensity the most when the upper-level shear is weak, the lower-level shear and associated moist static energy (MSE) gradient are sufficiently steep, and the lower-level meridional shear is strong. These experiments reveal two different regimes of convection-coupled monsoon depression growth: one in which convection is driven by MSE advection and one in which it is driven by surface heat fluxes and quasigeostrophic forcing for ascent. Both regimes require sufficiently strong meridional shear to achieve initial growth by barotropic instability.},

Using a large suite of climate model experiments, we find that substantial intensification of hot extremes could occur within the next 3 decades, below the 2\textdegree C global warming target currently being considered by policy makers. We also find that the intensification of hot extremes is associated with a shift towards more anticyclonic atmospheric circulation during the warm season, along with warm-season drying over much of the U.S. The possibility that intensification of hot extremes could result from relatively small increases in greenhouse gas concentrations suggests that constraining global warming to 2\textdegree C may not be sufficient to avoid dangerous climate change.},

For the most familiar case\textemdash water vapor in Earth's present climate\textemdash the condensible gas is dilute, in the sense that its concentration is everywhere small relative to the noncondensible background gases. A wide variety of important planetary climate problems involve nondilute condensible substances. These include planets near or undergoing a water vapor runaway and planets near the outer edge of the conventional habitable zone, for which CO2 is the condensible. Standard representations of convection in climate models rely on several approximations appropriate only to the dilute limit, while nondilute convection differs in fundamental ways from dilute convection. In this paper, a simple parameterization of convection valid in the nondilute as well as dilute limits is derived and used to discuss the basic character of nondilute convection. The energy conservation properties of the scheme are discussed in detail and are verified in radiative-convective simulations. As a further illustration of the behavior of the scheme, results for a runaway greenhouse atmosphere for both steady instellation and seasonally varying instellation corresponding to a highly eccentric orbit are presented. The latter case illustrates that the high thermal inertia associated with latent heat in nondilute atmospheres can damp out the effects of even extreme seasonal forcing.},

This configuration is applicable to icy solar system bodies such as Triton, as well as a range of possible exoplanet atmospheres, including water or CO2 iceballs or ocean worlds, and lava planets with mineral vapor atmospheres. Climate regimes for slowly rotating planets with the hotspot near the substellar point and for rapidly rotating planets with a warm equatorial belt are both treated. A nondimensional parameter controlling the fractional variation of the surface pressure is derived; it measures whether the pure condensible atmosphere is global or localized. The global pure condensible atmosphere with the nondimensional parameter much less than order of unity is maintained by the strong horizontal latent heat transport associated with an ``evaporation/sublimation-driven flow'' from warm to cold places that compensates for the incoming differential radiative forcing. We show that the variation of surface temperature can be estimated in terms of this nondimensional parameter if it is not too large. In the case of a pure water-vapor atmosphere with an ice or liquid surface, we show that the atmosphere is thick enough to maintain nearly isothermal surface conditions even when the substellar surface temperature is around the freezing point. Finally, it is proposed that the evaporation/sublimation-driven flow regime for global atmospheres could be detected via its effect on the inhomogeneous distribution of minor noncondensible components in the atmosphere.},

Ice water content (IWC) and water vapour (WV) measured in the UT and the TL by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS; Version 4.2) are compared to the precipitation (Prec) measured by the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM; Version 007). The two datasets, gridded within 2\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}}\&thinsp;\texttimes\&thinsp;2\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} horizontal bins, have been analysed during the austral convective season, December, January, and February (DJF), from 2004 to 2017. MLS observations are performed at 01:30 and 13:30 local solar time, whilst the Prec dataset is constructed with a time resolution of 1\&thinsp;h. The new contribution of this study is to provide a much more detailed picture of the diurnal variation of ice than is provided by the very limited (two per day) MLS observations. Firstly, we show that IWC represents 70\&thinsp;\% and 50\&thinsp;\% of the total water in the tropical UT and TL, respectively, and that Prec is spatially highly correlated with IWC in the UT (Pearson's linear coefficient \emph{R}=0.7). We propose a method that uses Prec as a proxy for deep convection bringing ice up to the UT and TL during the growing stage of convection, in order to estimate the amount of ice injected into the UT and the TL, respectively. We validate the method using ice measurements from the Superconducting Submillimeter-Wave Limb-Emission Sounder (SMILES) during the period DJF 2009\textendash 2010. Next, the diurnal cycle of injection of IWC into the UT and the TL by deep convection is calculated by the difference between the maximum and the minimum in the estimated diurnal cycle of IWC in these layers and over selected convective zones. Six tropical highly convective zones have been chosen: South America, South Africa, Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, and the Maritime Continent region, split into land (MariCont-L) and ocean (MariCont-O). IWC injection is found to be 2.73 and 0.41\&thinsp;mg m\textsuperscript{-3} over tropical land in the UT and TL, respectively, and 0.60 and 0.13\&thinsp;mg m\textsuperscript{-3} over tropical ocean in the UT and TL, respectively. The MariCont-L region has the greatest ice injection in both the UT and TL (3.34 and 0.42\textendash 0.56\&thinsp;mg m\textsuperscript{-3}, respectively). The MariCont-O region has less ice injection than MariCont-L (0.91\&thinsp;mg m\textsuperscript{-3} in the UT and 0.16\textendash 0.34\&thinsp;mg m\textsuperscript{-3} in TL) but has the highest diurnal minimum value of IWC in the TL (0.34\textendash 0.37\&thinsp;mg m\textsuperscript{-3}) among all oceanic zones.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The vertical distributions of water vapour and ozone are of great interest, particularly when considered together. Water vapour, originating at ground level, usually decreases rather rapidly with increasing height, particularly in the lower stratosphere. This leads to extremely low concentrations at a height of about 15 km. On the other hand, ozone, being formed by the action of solar ultra-violet radiation at a height of 30 km or more, decreases in concentration downwards. We find, therefore, ozone diffusing downwards and water vapour diffusing upwards through the same region of the atmosphere, but, as we shall see, with very different lapse rates. Water vapour The standard hygrometers which are used to measure the humidity from free balloons are only satisfactory at temperatures above about 235\textdegree K, and our knowledge of the humidity at high levels in the atmosphere is almost entirely dependent on measurements made with frost-point hygrometers carried on air\-craft. The work of the Meteorological Research Flight of the British Meteorological Office is notable for the very large number of measurements made from Mosquito aircraft to a height of about 12 km and more recently from Canberra aircraft to 15 km. Most unfortunately, hardly any measurements having similar accuracy have been made in other parts of the world. However, at the present time Dr A. W. Brewer is in north Norway making such measurements with the kind co-operation of the Norwegian Air Force and I had hoped that some results might have been available in time to report them at this Discussion (see note at end of paper).},

This study investigates intermodel differences in the magnitude of the pattern effect and how these differences contribute to the spread in effective equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) within CMIP5 and CMIP6 models. Effective ECS in CMIP5 estimated from 150-yr-long abrupt4\texttimes CO2 simulations is on average 10\% higher than that estimated from the early portion (first 50 years) of those simulations, which serves as an analog for historical warming; this difference is reduced to 7\% on average in CMIP6. The (negative) net radiative feedback weakens over the course of the abrupt4\texttimes CO2 simulations in the vast majority of CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, but this weakening is less dramatic on average in CMIP6. For both ensembles, the total variance in the effective ECS is found to be dominated by the spread in radiative response on fast time scales, rather than the spread in feedback changes. Using Green's functions derived from two AGCMs shows that the spread in feedbacks on fast time scales may be primarily due to differences in atmospheric model physics, whereas the spread in feedback evolution is primarily governed by differences in SST patterns. Intermodel spread in feedback evolution is well explained by differences in the relative warming in the west Pacific warm-pool regions for the CMIP5 models, but this relation fails to explain differences across the CMIP6 models, suggesting that a stronger sensitivity of extratropical clouds to surface warming may also contribute to feedback changes in CMIP6.},

  abstract = {Large fluctuations in continental configuration occur throughout the Mesozoic. While it has long been recognized that paleogeography may potentially influence atmospheric CO2 via the continental silicate weathering feedback, no numerical simulations have been done, because of the lack of a spatially resolved climate-carbon model. GEOCLIM, a coupled numerical model of the climate and global biogeochemical cycles, is used to investigate the consequences of the Pangea breakup. The climate module of the GEOCLIM model is the FOAM atmospheric general circulation model, allowing the calculation of the consumption of atmospheric CO2 through continental silicate weathering with a spatial resolution of 7.5\textdegree long \texttimes{} 4.5\textdegree lat. Seven time slices have been simulated. We show that the breakup of the Pangea supercontinent triggers an increase in continental runoff, resulting in enhanced atmospheric CO2 consumption through silicate weathering. As a result, atmospheric CO2 falls from values above 3000 ppmv during the Triassic down to rather low levels during the Cretaceous (around 400 ppmv), resulting in a decrease in global mean annual continental temperatures from about 20\textdegree C to 10\textdegree C. Silicate weathering feedback and paleogeography both act to force the Earth system toward a dry and hot world reaching its optimum over the last 260 Myr during the Middle-Late Triassic. In the super continent case, given the persistent aridity, the model generates high CO2 values to produce very warm continental temperatures. Conversely, in the fragmented case, the runoff becomes the most important contributor to the silicate weathering rate, hence producing a CO2 drawdown and a fall in continental temperatures. Finally, another unexpected outcome is the pronounced fluctuation in carbonate accumulation simulated by the model in response to the Pangea breakup. These fluctuations are driven by changes in continental carbonate weathering flux. Accounting for the fluctuations in area available for carbonate platforms, the simulated ratio of carbonate deposition between neritic and deep sea environments is in better agreement with available data.},

  abstract = {The low thermal gradients and clement winters characterizing climates of the Cretaceous period reveal that the climate system has modes of behaviour quite different from the present. Recent proxy data analyses suggest that some aspects of climate change within the Cretaceous appear to be decoupled from CO2 evolution at the geological time scale. Here, we investigate the impact of paleogeography on the global climate with the climate model FOAM, using a Early, Mid and Late Cretaceous continental configuration. We find that changes in geography from the Early to Mid-to-Late Cretaceous cause a large decrease of the seasonal cycle. First order identified processes are the decreased continentality of the mid-to-high latitudes from the Mid Cretaceous and the increase of the latent heat transport into the winter hemisphere which induce a wetter and a cloudier atmosphere capable of diminishing the winter cooling of the continents. Owing to the modifications of the seasonal cycle in response to the tectonic forcing, the equator-to-pole thermal gradient is reduced from the Early to Mid-to-Late Cretaceous. We nevertheless still do not succeed in simulating warm enough polar temperatures and a definitive theory still waits for an integrated approach explicitly accounting for each factor influencing the thermal gradient (ocean dynamics, stratospheric clouds, and vegetation). Our study also suggests a mechanism that can weaken the correlation between CO2 and climate changes during the Cretaceous as evolving geography from the Early to Late Cretaceous, through the response of the water cycle and the changes in the thermal gradient, results in a 3.8 \textdegree C global warming at a constant atmospheric CO2 level. This demonstrates that the paleogeography may affect the relation between pCO2 and the climate history and consequently has to be accounted for when linking the atmospheric CO2 evolution and the climate record at geological time scales.},

The vast majority of the observed global average planetary albedo (88\%) is due to atmospheric reflection. Surface reflection makes a relatively small contribution to planetary albedo because the atmosphere attenuates the surface contribution to planetary albedo by a factor of approximately 3. The global average planetary albedo in the ensemble average of phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) preindustrial simulations is also primarily (87\%) due to atmospheric albedo. The intermodel spread in planetary albedo is relatively large and is found to be predominantly a consequence of intermodel differences in atmospheric albedo, with surface processes playing a much smaller role despite significant intermodel differences in surface albedo. The CMIP3 models show a decrease in planetary albedo under a doubling of carbon dioxide\textemdash also primarily due to changes in atmospheric reflection (which explains more than 90\% of the intermodel spread). All models show a decrease in planetary albedo due to the lowered surface albedo associated with a contraction of the cryosphere in a warmer world, but this effect is small compared to the spread in planetary albedo due to model differences in the change in clouds.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

As a case study, a Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) model simulation previously documented to have reduced baroclinic storm activity, relative to the modern-day climate (simulated by the same model), despite having an enhanced midlatitude temperature gradient, is considered. Several candidate mechanisms are evaluated to explain this apparent paradox. A linear stability analysis is first performed on the jet in the modern-day and the LGM simulation; the latter has relatively strong barotropic velocity shear. It was found that the LGM mean state is more unstable to baroclinic disturbances than the modern-day mean state, although the three-dimensional jet structure does stabilize the LGM jet relative to the Eady growth rate. Next, feature tracking was used to assess the storm track seeding and temporal growth of disturbances. It was found that the reduction in LGM eddy activity, relative to the modern-day eddy activity, is due to the smaller magnitude of the upper-level storms entering the North Atlantic domain in the LGM. Although the LGM storms do grow more rapidly in the North Atlantic than their modern-day counterparts, the storminess in the LGM is reduced because storms seeding the region of enhanced baroclinity are weaker.},

  abstract = {The effect of ocean mixed layer depth on climate is explored in a suite of slab ocean aquaplanet simulations with different mixed layer depths ranging from a globally uniform value of 50\textendash 2.4 m. In addition to the expected increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in temperature with decreasing ocean mixed layer depth, the simulated climates differ in several less intuitive ways including fundamental changes in the annual mean climate. The phase of seasonal cycle in temperature differs non-monotonically with increasing ocean mixed layer depth, reaching a maximum in the 12 m slab depth simulation. This result is a consequence of the change in the source of the seasonal heating of the atmosphere across the suite of simulations. In the shallow ocean runs, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is dominated by the surface energy fluxes whereas the seasonal heating is dominated by direct shortwave absorption within the atmospheric column in the deep ocean runs. The surface fluxes are increasingly lagged with respect to the insolation as the ocean deepens which accounts for the increase in phase lag from the shallow to mid-depth runs. The direct shortwave absorption is in phase with insolation, and thus the total heating comes back in phase with the insolation as the ocean deepens more and the direct shortwave absorption dominates the seasonal heating of the atmosphere. The intertropical convergence zone follows the seasonally varying insolation and maximum sea surface temperatures into the summer hemisphere in the shallow ocean runs whereas it stays fairly close to the equator in the deep ocean runs. As a consequence, the tropical precipitation and region of high planetary albedo is spread more broadly across the low latitudes in the shallow runs, resulting in an apparent expansion of the tropics relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the global and annual mean planetary albedo is substantially (20~\%) higher in the shallow ocean simulations which results in a colder (7C) global and annual mean surface temperature. The increased tropical planetary albedo in the shallow ocean simulations also results in a decreased equator-to-pole gradient in absorbed shortwave radiation and drives a severely reduced ({$\approx$}50~\%) meridional energy transport relative to the deep ocean runs. As a result, the atmospheric eddies are weakened and shifted poleward (away from the high albedo tropics) and the eddy driven jet is also reduced and shifted poleward by 15\textdegree{} relative to the deep ocean run.},

MHT is partitioned here into atmospheric (AHT) and implied oceanic (OHT) heat transports. In turn, AHT is partitioned into dry and moist energy transport by the meridional overturning circulation (MOC), transient eddy energy transport (TE), and stationary eddy energy transport (SE) using only monthly averaged model output that is typically archived. In all climate models examined, the maximum total MHT (AHT + OHT) is nearly climate-state invariant, except for a modest (4\%, 0.3 PW) enhancement of MHT in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during the LGM. However, the partitioning of MHT depends markedly on the climate state, and the changes in partitioning differ considerably among different climate models. In response to CO\textsubscript{2} quadrupling, poleward implied OHT decreases, while AHT increases by a nearly compensating amount. The increase in annual-mean AHT is a smooth function of latitude but is due to a spatially inhomogeneous blend of changes in SE and TE that vary by season. During the LGM, the increase in wintertime SE transport in the NH midlatitudes exceeds the decrease in TE resulting in enhanced total AHT. Total AHT changes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) are not significant. These results suggest that the net top-of-atmosphere radiative constraints on total MHT are relatively invariant to climate forcing due to nearly compensating changes in absorbed solar radiation and outgoing longwave radiation. However, the partitioning of MHT depends on detailed regional and seasonal factors.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract The seasonal cycle of the heating of the atmosphere is divided into a component due to direct solar absorption in the atmosphere and a component due to the flux of energy from the surface to the atmosphere via latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes. Both observations and coupled climate models are analyzed. The vast majority of the seasonal heating of the northern extratropics (78\% in the observations and 67\% in the model average) is due to atmospheric shortwave absorption. In the southern extratropics, the seasonal heating of the atmosphere is entirely due to atmospheric shortwave absorption in both the observations and the models, and the surface heat flux opposes the seasonal heating of the atmosphere. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric temperature is surface amplified in the northern extratropics and nearly barotropic in the Southern Hemisphere; in both cases, the vertical profile of temperature reflects the source of the seasonal heating. In the northern extratropics, the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heating over land differs markedly from that over the ocean. Over the land, the surface energy fluxes complement the driving absorbed shortwave flux; over the ocean, they oppose the absorbed shortwave flux. This gives rise to large seasonal differences in the temperature of the atmosphere over land and ocean. Downgradient temperature advection by the mean westerly winds damps the seasonal cycle of heating of the atmosphere over the land and amplifies it over the ocean. The seasonal cycle in the zonal energy transport is 4.1 PW. Finally, the authors examine the change in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric heating in 11 models from phase 3 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) due to a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide from preindustrial concentrations. The seasonal heating of the troposphere is everywhere enhanced by increased shortwave absorption by water vapor; it is reduced where sea ice has been replaced by ocean, which increases the effective heat storage reservoir of the climate system and thereby reduces the seasonal magnitude of energy fluxes between the surface and the atmosphere. As a result, the seasonal amplitude of temperature increases in the upper troposphere (where atmospheric shortwave absorption increases) and decreases at the surface (where the ice melts).},

The value of MHTMAX can be expressed as the difference between the equator-to-pole contrast in absorbed solar radiation (ASR*) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR*). As an example, in the Northern Hemisphere observations, the extratropics (defined as the region with a net radiative deficit) receive an 8.2-PW deficit of net solar radiation (ASR*) relative to the global average that is balanced by a 2.4-PW deficit of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR*) and 5.8 PW of energy import via the atmospheric and oceanic circulation (MHTMAX). The intermodel spread of MHTMAX in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) simulations of the preindustrial climate is primarily (R2 = 0.72) due to differences in ASR* while model differences in OLR* are uncorrelated with the MHTMAX spread. The net solar radiation (ASR*) is partitioned into contributions from (i) the equator-to-pole contrast in incident radiation acting on the global average albedo and (ii) the equator-to-pole contrast of planetary albedo, which is further subdivided into components due to atmospheric and surface reflection. In the observations, 62\% of ASR* is due to the meridional distribution of incident radiation, 33\% is due to atmospheric reflection, and 5\% is due to surface reflection. The intermodel spread in ASR* is due to model differences in the equator-to-pole gradient in planetary albedo, which are primarily a consequence of atmospheric reflection differences (92\% of the spread), and is uncorrelated with differences in surface reflection. As a consequence, the spread in MHTMAX in climate models is primarily due to the spread in cloud reflection properties.},

Meridional mass transport streamfunctions are calculated not only using pressure as a vertical coordinate but also using temperature, specific humidity, and geopotential height as generalized vertical coordinates. Moreover, mass transport streamfunctions are calculated using the latent, the dry static, or the moist static energy as generalized vertical coordinates. The total meridional energy transport can be obtained by integrating these streamfunctions ``vertically'' over their entire energy range. The time-averaged mass transport streamfunctions are also decomposed into mean-flow and eddy-induced components. The meridional mass transport streamfunctions with temperature and specific humidity as independent variables yield a two-cell structure with a tropical Hadley-like cell and a pronounced extratropical Ferrel-like cell, which carries warm and moist air poleward. These Ferrel-like cells are much stronger than the Eulerian zonal-mean Ferrel cell, a feature that can be understood by considering the residual circulation related to specific humidity or temperature. Regardless of the generalized vertical coordinate, the present meridional mass transport streamfunctions yield essentially a two-layer structure with one poleward and one equatorward branch. The strongest meridional overturning in the midlatitudes is obtained when the specific humidity or the moist static energy is used as the vertical coordinate, indicating that the specific humidity is the variable that best distinguishes between poleward- and equatorward-moving air in the lower troposphere.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Gaussian smoothers in space and time have been applied to the observed record of severe thunderstorm occurrence from 1980 to 1994 to produce daily maps and annual cycles at any point. Many aspects of this climatology have been identified in previous work, but the method allows for the consideration of the record in several new ways. A review of the raw data, broken down in various ways, reveals that numerous nonmeteorological artifacts are present in the raw data. These are predominantly associated with the marginal nontornadic severe thunderstorm events, including an enormous growth in the number of severe weather reports since the mid-1950s. Much of this growth may be associated with a drive to improve warning verification scores. The smoothed spatial and temporal distributions of the probability of nontornadic severe thunderstorm events are presented in several ways. The distribution of significant nontornadic severe thunderstorm reports (wind speeds {$\geq$} 65 kt and/or hailstone diameters {$\geq$} 2 in.) is consistent with the hypothesis that supercells are responsible for the majority of such reports.},

This approach is motivated by the expectation that the resultant improvements in soil moisture will lead to improved land surface latent heating (LH). Here aspects of the MERRA-2 land surface energy budget and 2-m air temperatures {$<$}inline-formula xmlns:ifp="http://www.ifactory.com/press"{$><$}img src="jcli-d-17-0121.1-inf1.gif"{$><$}/img{$><$}/inline-formula{$>$} are assessed. For global land annual averages, MERRA-2 appears to overestimate the LH (by 5 W m\textsuperscript{-2}), the sensible heating (by 6 W m\textsuperscript{-2}), and the downwelling shortwave radiation (by 14 W m\textsuperscript{-2}) while underestimating the downwelling and upwelling (absolute) longwave radiation (by 10\textendash 15 W m\textsuperscript{-2} each). These results differ only slightly from those for NASA's previous reanalysis, MERRA. Comparison to various gridded reference datasets over boreal summer (June\textendash August) suggests that MERRA-2 has particularly large positive biases (\&gt;20 W m\textsuperscript{-2}) where LH is energy limited and that these biases are associated with evaporative fraction biases rather than radiation biases.

Calculations are based on the historical period and climate change scenarios. As in the observations the warming pattern contains a warming hole over the subpolar North Atlantic. Using a bivariate regression of SAT to GMT and an index of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the warming pattern is decomposed in a radiatively forced part and an AMOC fingerprint. The North Atlantic warming hole is associated with a decline of the AMOC. The AMOC fingerprint resembles Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV), but details of the pattern change when the AMOC decline increases, underscoring the nonlinearity in the response.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The warming hole is situated south of deep convection sites, indicating that it involves an adjustment of the gyre circulation, although it should be noted that some models feature deep convection in the middle of the subpolar gyre. The warming hole is already prominent in historical runs, where the response of the AMOC to GMT is weak, which suggests that it is involved in an ocean adjustment that precedes the AMOC decline. In the more strongly forced scenario runs, the warming hole over the subpolar gyre becomes weaker, while cooling over the Nordic seas increases, consistent with previous findings that deep convection in the Labrador and Irminger Seas is more vulnerable to changes in external forcing than convection in the Nordic seas, which only reacts after a threshold is passed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, to what degree the TP warming amplification relates to remote forcing such as sea ice loss in the Arctic sea ice remains unclear. Here, we found that the decline of sea ice concentration over the Barents-Kara Sea (BKS) could account for 18\textendash 32\% of the winter warming over the TP by comparing observational data and ensemble experiments from an atmospheric general circulation model. The reduced BKS sea ice and resultant upward turbulent heat fluxes can intensify a Rossby wave train propagating equatorward to the TP. As a result, the enhanced southwesterlies towards the TP strengthen the warm advection over most parts of the TP and lead to TP warming. In addition, an atmospheric teleconnection between the Arctic and the TP also exists in the interannual variability. That is, a tripole mode in air temperature, with warm centers in the Arctic and TP but a cold center in the mid-high latitudes of the Eurasian continent in between. Our results imply that the BKS sea ice loss could intensify such a tripole mode and thus enhancing the winter TP warming.},

In particular, the ``wet-get-wetter'' mechanism describes an amplification of the pattern of precipitation in a moister atmosphere, and the ``warmer-get-wetter'' mechanism describes enhanced upward motion and precipitation in regions where the increase in SST exceeds the tropical-mean increase. Studies of the current climate have shown that surface convergence over the tropical oceans is largely driven by horizontal gradients of low-level temperature, but the influence of these gradients on the precipitation response under climate warming has received little attention. Here, a simple model is applied to give a decomposition of changes in precipitation over tropical oceans in twenty-first-century climate model projections. The wet-get-wetter mechanism and changes in surface convergence are found to be of widespread importance, whereas the warmer-get-wetter mechanism is primarily limited to negative anomalies in the tropical southern Pacific. Furthermore, surface convergence is linked to gradients of boundary layer temperature using an atmospheric mixed layer model. Changes in surface convergence are found to be strongly related to changes in the Laplacian of boundary layer virtual temperature, and, to a lesser extent, the Laplacian of SST. Taken together, these results suggest that a ``Laplacian-of-warming'' mechanism is of comparable importance to wet get wetter and warmer get wetter for the response of precipitation to climate change over tropical oceans.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Since the 1970s, results from radiative transfer models unambiguously show that an increase in the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration leads to an increase of the greenhouse effect. However, this robust result is often misunderstood and often questioned. A common argument is that the CO2 greenhouse effect is saturated (i.e., does not increase) as CO2 absorption of an entire atmospheric column, named absorptivity, is saturated. This argument is erroneous first because absorptivity by CO2 is currently not fully saturated and still increases with CO2 concentration and second because a change in emission height explains why the greenhouse effect may increase even if the absorptivity is saturated. However, these explanations are only qualitative. In this article, we first propose a way of quantifying the effects of both the emission height and absorptivity and we illustrate which one of the two dominates for a suite of simple idealized atmospheres. Then, using a line-by-line model and a representative standard atmospheric profile, we show that the increase of the greenhouse effect resulting from an increase of CO2 from its current value is primarily due (about 90\%) to the change in emission height. For an increase of water vapor, the change in absorptivity plays a more important role (about 40\%) but the change in emission height still has the largest contribution (about 60\%).},

Here we present computations of grounding line dynamics on the basis of numerical solutions of the full Stokes equations for ice velocity, coupled with the evolution of the air ice\textendash{} and sea ice\textendash free interfaces. The grounding line position is determined by solving the contact problem between the ice and a rigid bedrock using the finite element code Elmer. Results of the simulations show that marine ice sheets are unstable on upsloping beds and undergo hysteresis under perturbation of ice viscosity, confirming conclusions from boundary layer theory. The present approach also indicates that a 2-D unconfined marine ice sheet sliding over a downsloping bedrock does not exhibit neutral equilibrium. It is shown that mesh resolution around the grounding line is a crucial issue. A very fine grid size ({$<$}100 m spacing) is needed in order to achieve consistent results.},

The model is compressible, uses a terrain-following coordinate system, and employs lateral and upper boundary conditions which minimize wave reflections. The model's accuracy and sensitivity are examined. These tests suggest that in numerical simulations of vertically propagating, highly nonlinear mountain waves, a wave absorbing layer does not accurately mimic the effects of wave breakdown and dissipation at high levels in the atmosphere. In order to obtain a correct simulation, the region in which the waves are physically absorbed must generally be included in the computational domain (a nonreflective upper boundary condition should be used as well). The utility of the model is demonstrated in two examples (linear waves in a uniform atmosphere and the 11 January 1972 Boulder windstorm) which illustrate how the presence of moisture can influence propagating waves. In both cases, the addition of moisture to the upstream flow greatly reduces the wave response.},

Additionally, model intercomparisons show a large spread in the magnitude of Arctic warming for these warmer-than-modern climates. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these disagreements, including the unrealistic representation of polar clouds or underestimated poleward heat transport in the models. This study provides an intercomparison of Arctic cloud and atmospheric heat transport (AHT) responses to strong imposed polar-amplified surface ocean warming across four atmosphere-only GCMs. All models simulate an increase in high clouds throughout the year; the resulting reduction in longwave radiation loss to space acts to support the imposed Arctic warming. The response of low- and midlevel clouds varies considerably across the models, with models responding differently to surface warming and sea ice removal. The AHT is consistently weaker in the imposed warming experiments due to a large reduction in dry static energy transport that offsets a smaller increase in latent heat transport, thereby opposing the imposed surface warming. Our idealized polar amplification experiments require very large increases in implied ocean heat transport (OHT) to maintain steady state. Increased CO\textsubscript{2} or tropical temperatures that likely characterized past warm climates reduce the need for such large OHT increases.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Most of the global mean changes come from the high latitudes, especially over the ocean. All 24 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 models agree on these changes and, over the twenty-first century, average a phase delay of 5 days and an amplitude decrease of 5\% for the global mean ocean surface temperature. Evidence is provided that the changes are mainly driven by sea ice loss: as sea ice melts during the twenty-first century, the previously unexposed open ocean increases the effective heat capacity of the surface layer, slowing and damping the temperature response. From the tropics to the midlatitudes, changes in phase and amplitude are smaller and less spatially uniform than near the poles but are still prevalent in the models. These regions experience a small phase delay but an amplitude increase of the surface temperature cycle, a combination that is inconsistent with changes to the effective heat capacity of the system.

  abstract = {Predictions for sea-level rise this century due to melt from Antarctica range from zero to more than one metre. The highest predictions are driven by the controversial marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) hypothesis, which assumes that coastal ice cliffs can rapidly collapse after ice shelves disintegrate, as a result of surface and sub-shelf melting caused by global warming. But MICI has not been observed in the modern era and it remains unclear whether it is required to reproduce sea-level variations in the geological past. Here we quantify ice-sheet modelling uncertainties for the original MICI study and show that the probability distributions are skewed towards lower values (under very high greenhouse gas concentrations, the most likely value is 45 centimetres). However, MICI is not required to reproduce sea-level changes due to Antarctic ice loss in the mid-Pliocene epoch, the last interglacial period or 1992\textendash 2017; without it we find that the projections agree with previous studies (all 95th percentiles are less than 43 centimetres). We conclude that previous interpretations of these MICI projections over-estimate sea-level rise this century; because the MICI hypothesis is not well constrained, confidence in projections with MICI would require a greater range of observationally constrained models of ice-shelf vulnerability and ice-cliff collapse.},

It is suggested that the forcing of planetary-scale modes by the nonlinear interaction with synoptic-scale weather systems contributes considerably to the creation and maintenance of blocking in the Northern Hemisphere. In the atmosphere, topographic effects will generate planetary-scale waves. The planetary modes can extract energy from the mean flow. The wave amplitudes in the model should be smaller than those observed. In these circumstances blocks that can satisfy the amplitude criterion will be rare. The problem is circumvented by tuning the damping in the model such as to have wave amplitudes that are close to those observed. The mean flow obtained hardly resembles the observed mean flow for Pacific blocking. The agreement for the Atlantic cases is good for the linear and the nonlinear run. It is suggested that the barotropic vorticity equation can be used even in a linearized form to study the impact of synoptic-scale forcing on the planetary flow.},

Therefore, the question arises of whether restoring global warming to this target after exceeding it by artificially removing CO\textsubscript{2} from the atmosphere is possible. One important aspect is the reversibility of ocean heat uptake and associated sea level rise, which have very long (centennial to millennial) response timescales. In this study the response of sea level rise due to thermal expansion to a 1 \% yearly increase of atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} up to a quadrupling of the pre-industrial concentration followed by a 1 \% yearly decline back to the pre-industrial CO\textsubscript{2} concentration is examined using the University of Victoria Earth System Climate Model (UVic ESCM). We find that global mean thermosteric sea level (GMTSL) continues to rise for several decades after atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} starts to decline and does not return to pre-industrial levels for over 1000 years after atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} is restored to the pre-industrial concentration. This finding is independent of the strength of vertical sub-grid-scale ocean mixing implemented in the model. Furthermore, GMTSL rises faster than it declines in response to a symmetric rise and decline in atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} concentration partly because the deep ocean continues to warm for centuries after atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} returns to the pre-industrial concentration. Both GMTSL rise and decline rates increase with increasing vertical ocean mixing. Exceptions from this behaviour arise if the overturning circulations in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean intensify beyond pre-industrial levels in model versions with lower vertical mixing, which leads to rapid cooling of the deep ocean.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, climate sensitivity and its governing processes are still subject to large uncertainty. Recently it has been established that climate sensitivity changes over time in numerical climate model experiments with abrupt quadrupling of the CO2 concentration. Here we conduct an analysis of such experiments from a range of climate models from phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Climate feedbacks associated with clouds, lapse rate, Planck radiation, surface albedo, and water vapour and their changes over time are diagnosed based on a radiative kernel method. We find two clearly distinct model groups, one with weak and one with strong lapse-rate feedback change. The Arctic is the region showing the largest differences between these two model groups, both with respect to warming change and individual feedback changes. We retrace this change to the development over time of the Arctic sea ice, which impacts both the surface-albedo and lapse-rate feedbacks. Generally, models that warm fast, both globally and in the Arctic, also quickly lose their Arctic sea ice and change their total global-mean climate feedback only little, and vice versa. However, it remains unclear if the Arctic changes are a cause or rather a by-product of the total global-mean feedback change. Finally, we find support for the results of previous studies, that the relative warming in the tropical Indo-Pacific region may control the change of total climate feedback over time.},

However, equilibrium ice thickness is an extremely sensitive function of the ice albedo, allowing errors in simulated cloud cover to be compensated by tuning of the ice albedo. This analysis suggests that the results of current GCMs cannot be relied upon at face value for credible predictions of future Arctic sea ice.},

On the other hand, the CISK hypothesis, in the form originally advanced by Charney and Eliassen, holds that initial development results from the organized release of preexisting conditional instability. In this series of papers, we explore the relative importance of ambient conditional instability and air-sea latent and sensible heat transfer in both the development and maintenance of tropical cyclones using highly idealized models. In particular, we advance the hypothesis that the intensification and maintenance of tropical cyclones depend exclusively on self-induced heat transfer from the ocean. In this sense, these storms may be regarded as resulting from a finite amplitude air-sea interaction instability rather than from a linear instability involving ambient potential buoyancy. In the present paper, we attempt to show that reasonably intense cyclones may be maintained in a steady state without conditional instability of ambient air. In Part II we will demonstrate that weak but finite-amplitude axisymmetric disturbances may intensify in a conditionally neutral environment.},

In spite of the catastrophic disruption of the local environment that accompanies bolide impacts and volcanic eruptions, it has been difficult to explain why these events sometimes lead to global extinction of species. We propose that, in some cases, the missing link may be provided by hypercanes, runaway hurricanes that are capable of injecting massive amounts of water and aerosols into the middle and upper stratosphere, where they may have profound effects on atmospheric chemistry and radiative transfer. Hypercanes are theorized to occur when the sea surface temperature exceeds a critical threshold, which may occur when sea water is locally heated by bolide impact, shallow-sea volcanism, or possibly, by overturning of superheated brine pools formed by underwater volcanic activity. Simulations using a convection-resolving nonhydrostatic, axisymmetric numerical model show that hypercanes can indeed develop when the sea surface temperature is high, and that they inject large amounts of mass into the stratosphere.},

We present the results of four such efforts conducted in the ascent regions of midlatitude cyclones observed during the New England Winter Storms and Genesis of Atlantic Lows Experiments. In three of the four cases the atmosphere was almost exactly neutral to slantwise ascent while being quite stable to vertical displacements. In the fourth case, the atmosphere departed from neutrality but was also substantially drier, evidently due to subsidence. We find excellent agreement between assessments of stability based on the M surface flights and on cross sections constructed from rawinsonde observations. On the basis of these results I hypothesize that slantwise convective neutrality is characteristic of the ascent regions of baroclinic cyclones and discuss the implications of this finding for the dynamics of baroclinic systems.},

Recent aircraft and dropsonde data also show that these storms, like hurricanes, occur within deep moist adiabatic atmospheres and possess warm cores.

Using a recently developed theoretical model of the mature hurricane, we show that the observed difference between the moist entropy of the troposphere and that representing saturation at sea surface temperature can sustain moderately intense hurricanes. Unlike the environments of tropical hurricanes, much of this moist entropy difference results from an air-sea temperature difference. Numerical experiments using an axisymmetric nonhydrostatic model confirm that intense hurricanes can develop in environments typical of those in which polar lows are observed to develop. Due to the relatively large values of the Coriolis parameter, these storms have smaller diameters than do hurricanes. The experiments also show that the deep, cold cut-off lows which create favorable thermodynamic environments for polar lows also inhibit their development because of the large intertial stability of their circulations. Finally, we show that, like hurricanes, surface flux-driven polar lows cannot arise spontaneously, but require an independent and presumably non-axisymmetric dynamical mechanism for their initiation.},

To this enigma may be added the evidence that climate may undergo extraordinarily abrupt transitions. An attractive idea to help explain these characteristics is the notion that the Earth possesses a limited number of stable climate regimes that may overlap to produce multiple equilibrium states for the same solar forcing. Here we present a simple model that produces such overlapping stable equilibria, based on a few key feedback processes. These include control of atmospheric clouds and water vapor by the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere, control of the depth and intensity of the ocean's thermohaline circulation by tropical cyclones, and the dependence of atmospheric CO2 content on ocean temperature and the strength of the thermohaline circulation. We will show that these key feedback processes produce a climate with two or three stable, overlapping climate regimes. Subjecting this system to variations in climate forcing can account for several observed features of the climate system, including abrupt transitions, sensitivity to orbital variations, arctic warmth and high bottom water temperature during the Eocene and late Cretaceous, tempestites, and possible episodes of deep ocean anoxia during the Cretaceous.},

  abstract = {Over the coming century, both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover are projected to substantially decline. While many studies have documented the potential impacts of projected Arctic sea ice loss on the climate of the mid-latitudes and the tropics, little attention has been paid to the impacts of Antarctic sea ice loss. Here, using comprehensive climate model simulations, we show that the effects of end-of-the-century projected Antarctic sea ice loss extend much further than the tropics, and are able to produce considerable impacts on Arctic climate. Specifically, our model indicates that the Arctic surface will warm by 1 \textdegree C and Arctic sea ice extent will decline by 0.5 \texttimes{} 106 km2 in response to future Antarctic sea ice loss. Furthermore, with the aid of additional atmosphere-only simulations, we show that this pole-to-pole effect is mediated by the response of the tropical SSTs to Antarctic sea ice loss: these simulations reveal that Rossby waves originating in the tropical Pacific cause the Aleutian Low to deepen in the boreal winter, bringing warm air into the Arctic, and leading to sea ice loss in the Bering Sea. This pole-to-pole signal highlights the importance of understanding the climate impacts of the projected sea ice loss in the Antarctic, which could be as important as those associated with projected sea ice loss in the Arctic.},

The effects of Arctic sea-ice loss are not limited to the northern high latitudes, and reach deep into the tropics. Yet little is known about the effects of future Antarctic sea-ice loss outside of the southern high latitudes. Here, using a fully coupled climate model, we investigate the tropical response to Antarctic sea-ice loss and compare it with the response to Arctic sea-ice loss. We show that Antarctic sea-ice loss, similar to Arctic sea-ice loss, causes enhanced warming in the eastern equatorial Pacific and an equatorward intensification of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. We demonstrate that Antarctic sea-ice loss causes a mini global warming signal comparable to the one caused by Arctic sea-ice loss, and reminiscent of the response to greenhouse gases. We also show that ocean dynamics are key to capturing the tropical response to sea-ice loss. In short, we find that future Antarctic sea-ice loss will exert a profound influence on the tropics. Combined Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice losses will account for 20\textendash 30\% of the projected tropical warming and precipitation changes under the high-emissions scenario Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5.},

We show that Arctic Amplification is only a recent phenomenon, and that for much of this period the Arctic cooled while the global-mean temperature rose. To investigate why this occurred, we analyze large ensembles of comprehensive climate model simulations under different forcing scenarios. Our results suggest that the global warming from greenhouse gases was largely offset in the Arctic by regional cooling due to aerosols, with internal climate variability also contributing to Arctic cooling and global warming trends during this period. This suggests that the disruption of Arctic Amplification was due to a combination of factors unique to the 20th century, and that enhanced Arctic warming should be expected to be a consistent feature of climate change over the coming century.},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous studies have used coupled climate model simulations with perturbed sea ice covers to assess the impact of future Arctic sea ice loss. The results of these studies suggest that Arctic sea ice loss will cause substantial climate impacts both in the Arctic and beyond. The approaches used in these simulations can be broadly categorized into three methodologies: adding a ghost flux to the sea ice module, nudging, and modifying the surface albedo. Here we show that all three methodologies ultimately add heat to the Arctic in order to melt the sea ice, and that this artificial heating causes a spurious warming signal that is added to the warming that occurs due to sea ice loss alone. We illustrate this using an idealized climate model, which provides a preliminary rough estimate of the effect. In this model, the annual-mean warming due to sea ice loss alone can be directly calculated. We compare this with the warming that would be attributed to sea ice loss using each of the three methodologies in the idealized model. The results suggest that each methodology substantially overestimates the warming due to sea ice loss alone, overestimating the surface warming throughout the Northern Hemisphere by a factor of 1.5\textendash 2 in the idealized model. Hence these results suggest that previous coupled climate modeling studies have overestimated the climate response to sea ice loss.},

Here we present an idealized physical model that simulates the timing of snowpack melt under changing temperature and use it to show that this observed disparity in the sensitivity of snowpack disappearance to warming results from a mechanism related to the sinusoidal shape of the annual cycle of temperature. Applying this model globally, we show that under uniform warming the timing of snowpack disappearance will change most rapidly in coastal regions, the Arctic, the western United States, Central Europe and South America, with much smaller changes in the northern interiors of North America and Eurasia.},

  abstract = {Abstract Extratropical transition (ET) is the process by which a tropical cyclone, upon encountering a baroclinic environment and reduced sea surface temperature at higher latitudes, transforms into an extratropical cyclone. This process is influenced by, and influences, phenomena from the tropics to the midlatitudes and from the meso- to the planetary scales to extents that vary between individual events. Motivated in part by recent high-impact and/or extensively observed events such as North Atlantic Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and western North Pacific Typhoon Sinlaku in 2008, this review details advances in understanding and predicting ET since the publication of an earlier review in 2003. Methods for diagnosing ET in reanalysis, observational, and model-forecast datasets are discussed. New climatologies for the eastern North Pacific and southwest Indian Oceans are presented alongside updates to western North Pacific and North Atlantic Ocean climatologies. Advances in understanding and, in some cases, modeling the direct impacts of ET-related wind, waves, and precipitation are noted. Improved understanding of structural evolution throughout the transformation stage of ET fostered in large part by novel aircraft observations collected in several recent ET events is highlighted. Predictive skill for operational and numerical model ET-related forecasts is discussed along with environmental factors influencing posttransition cyclone structure and evolution. Operational ET forecast and analysis practices and challenges are detailed. In particular, some challenges of effective hazard communication for the evolving threats posed by a tropical cyclone during and after transition are introduced. This review concludes with recommendations for future work to further improve understanding, forecasts, and hazard communication.},

  abstract = {Abstract The quasi-equilibrium heat balances, as well as the responses to 4 \texttimes{} CO2 perturbation, are compared among three global climate models with the aim to identify and explain intermodel differences in ocean heat uptake (OHU) processes. It is found that, in quasi equilibrium, convective and mixed layer processes, as well as eddy-related processes, cause cooling of the subsurface ocean. The cooling is balanced by warming caused by advective and diapycnally diffusive processes. It is also found that in the CO2-perturbed climates the largest contribution to OHU comes from changes in vertical mixing processes and the mean circulation, particularly in the extratropics, caused both by changes in wind forcing and by changes in high-latitude buoyancy forcing. There is a substantial warming in the tropics: a significant part of which occurs because of changes in horizontal advection in extratropics. Diapycnal diffusion makes only a weak contribution to the OHU, mainly in the tropics, because of increased stratification. There are important qualitative differences in the contribution of eddy-induced advection and isopycnal diffusion to the OHU among the models. The former is related to the different values of the coefficients used in the corresponding scheme. The latter is related to the different tapering formulations of the isopycnal diffusion scheme. These differences affect the OHU in the deep ocean, which is substantial in two of the models, with the dominant region of deep warming being the Southern Ocean. However, most of the OHU takes place above 2000 m, and the three models are quantitatively similar in their global OHU efficiency and its breakdown among processes and as a function of latitude.},

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850\textendash near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases? {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.{$<$}/p{$><$}/p{$>$}},

Here we investigate how surface wetness affects the tropical hydrological cycle. When surface wetness is decreased in an Earth-like general circulation model, the tropics remain wet but the transition from a rainy to a rain-free regime. The rain-free regime occurs when surface precipitation is suppressed as negative evaporation (surface condensation) balances moisture flux convergence. The regime transition is dominated by near-surface relative humidity changes in contrast to the hypothesis that relative humidity changes are small. We show near-surface relative humidity changes responsible for the regime transition are controlled by re-evaporation of stratiform precipitation near the lifting condensation level. Re-evaporation impacts the near-surface through vertical mixing. Our results reveal a new rain-free tropical hydrological cycle regime that goes beyond the wet/dry paradigm.},

Present climate is now known to represent one regime among others including glacial climates such as characterized recent intervals of the Pleistocene and the much warmer equable climates of the Eocene and Cretaceous. An important test of climate theory is the ability to explain the record of climate change in terms of atmosphere-ocean dynamics, and the response of the dynamics to internal and external changes. The hypothesis is advanced that variation in the strength and extent of the symmetric circulation is an important mechanism mediating climate change. Using a simplified model we explore dynamical variables that influence the symmetric circulation and the physical processes that may have modified these dynamical variables to maintain the warm equable climates.},

These jets may be steady, vacillate with a definite period, or be irregular. A comprehensive theory for this phenomenon is presented based on the mutual interaction between the coherent jet and the turbulent eddies. When a sufficient number of statistically independent realizations of the eddy field participate in organizing the jet a simplified asymptotic dynamics emerges with progression, as an order parameter such as the eddy forcing is increased, from a stable fixed point associated with a steady symmetric zonal jet through a pitchfork bifurcation to a stable asymmetric jet followed by a Hopf bifurcation to a stable limit cycle associated with a regularly vacillating jet and finally a transition to chaos. This underlying asymptotic dynamics emerges when a sufficient number of ensemble members is retained in the stochastic forcing of the jet but a qualitative different mean jet dynamics is found when a small number of ensemble members is retained as is appropriate for many physical systems. Example applications of this theory are presented including a model of midlatitude jet vacillation, emergence and maintenance of multiple jets in turbulent flow, a model of rapid reorganization of storm tracks as a threshold in radiative forcing is passed, and a model of the quasi-biennial oscillation. Because the statistically coupled wave\textendash mean flow system discussed is generally globally stable this system also forms the basis for a comprehensive theory for equilibration of unstable jets in turbulent shear flow.},

Similar results are found for the model of Charney, implying that exponential instability cannot, in general, serve to explain the occurrence of cyclone scale disturbances in midlatitudes. Rather these are seen to arise additionally and perhaps predominantly from the release of mean flow potential energy by favorably configured initial perturbations. The Petterssen criterion for midlatitude cyclogenesis results naturally from this development as does its extension to the formation of subtropical monsoon depressions.

  abstract = {Abstract             The mean and annual cycle of energy flowing into the climate system and its storage, release, and transport in the atmosphere, ocean, and land surface are estimated with recent observations. An emphasis is placed on establishing internally consistent quantitative estimates with discussion and assessment of uncertainty. At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), adjusted radiances from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are used, while in the atmosphere the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\textendash National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\textendash NCAR) reanalysis and 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) estimates are used. The net upward surface flux (FS) over ocean is derived as the residual of the TOA and atmospheric energy budgets, and is compared with direct calculations of ocean heat content (OE) and its tendency ({$\delta$}OE/{$\delta$}t) from several ocean temperature datasets. Over land, FS from a stand-alone simulation of the Community Land Model forced by observed fields is used. A depiction of the full energy budget based on ERBE fluxes from 1985 to 1989 and CERES fluxes from 2000 to 2004 is constructed that matches estimates of the global, global ocean, and global land imbalances. In addition, the annual cycle of the energy budget during both periods is examined and compared with ocean heat content changes.             The near balance between the net TOA radiation (RT) and FS over ocean and thus with OE, and between RT and atmospheric total energy divergence over land, are documented both in the mean and for the annual cycle. However, there is an annual mean transport of energy by the atmosphere from ocean to land regions of 2.2 {$\pm$} 0.1 PW (1 PW = 1015 W) primarily in the northern winter when the transport exceeds 5 PW. The global albedo is dominated by a semiannual cycle over the oceans, but combines with the large annual cycle in solar insolation to produce a peak in absorbed solar and net radiation in February, somewhat after the perihelion, and with the net radiation 4.3 PW higher than the annual mean, as it is enhanced by the annual cycle of outgoing longwave radiation that is dominated by land regions. In situ estimates of the annual variation of OE are found to be unrealistically large. Challenges in diagnosing the interannual variability in the energy budget and its relationship to climate change are identified in the context of the episodic and inconsistent nature of the observations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Meridional structure and transports of energy in the atmosphere, ocean, and land are evaluated holistically for the mean and annual cycle zonal averages over the ocean, land, and global domains, with discussion and assessment of uncertainty. At the top of the atmosphere (TOA), adjusted radiances from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) and Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) are used along with estimates of energy storage and transport from two global reanalysis datasets for the atmosphere. Three ocean temperature datasets are used to assess changes in the ocean heat content (OE) and their relationship to the net upward surface energy flux over ocean (FoS), which is derived from the residual of the TOA and atmospheric energy budgets. The surface flux over land is from a stand-alone simulation of the Community Land Model forced by observed fields.             In the extratropics, absorbed solar radiation (ASR) achieves a maximum in summer with peak values near the solstices. Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) maxima also occur in summer but lag ASR by 1\textendash 2 months, consistent with temperature maxima over land. In the tropics, however, OLR relates to high cloud variations and peaks late in the dry monsoon season, while the OLR minima in summer coincide with deep convection in the monsoon trough at the height of the rainy season. Most of the difference between the TOA radiation and atmospheric energy storage tendency is made up by a large heat flux into the ocean in summer and out of the ocean in winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, the transport of energy from ocean to land regions is substantial in winter, and modest in summer. In the Southern Hemisphere extratropics, land - ocean differences play only a small role and the main energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean is poleward. There is reasonably good agreement between FoS and observed changes in OE, except for south of 40\textdegree S, where differences among several ocean datasets point to that region as the main source of errors in achieving an overall energy balance. The winter hemisphere atmospheric circulation is the dominant contributor to poleward energy transports outside of the tropics [6\textendash 7 PW (1 petawatt = 1015 W)], with summer transports being relatively weak ({$\sim$}3 PW)\textemdash slightly more in the Southern Hemisphere and slightly less in the Northern Hemisphere. Ocean transports outside of the tropics are found to be small (\&lt;2 PW) for all months. Strong cross-equatorial heat transports in the ocean of up to 5 PW exhibit a large annual cycle in phase with poleward atmospheric transports of the winter hemisphere.},

The approach is motivated, described, and applied to available Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) archives and the Community Earth System Model (CESM) Version 1 Large Ensemble archives with the goal of robustly benchmarking model performance and its evolution across CMIP generations. A scoring system is employed that minimizes sensitivity to internal variability, external forcings, and model tuning. Scores are based on pattern correlations of the simulated mean state, seasonal contrasts, and ENSO teleconnections. A broad range of feedback-relevant fields is considered and summarized on discrete timescales (climatology, seasonal, interannual) and physical realms (energy budget, water cycle, dynamics). Fields are also generally chosen for which observational uncertainty is small compared to model structural differences.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Highest mean variable scores across models are reported for well-observed fields such as sea level pressure, precipitable water, and outgoing longwave radiation, while the lowest scores are reported for 500\&thinsp;hPa vertical velocity, net surface energy flux, and precipitation minus evaporation. The fidelity of models is found to vary widely both within and across CMIP generations. Systematic increases in model fidelity in more recent CMIP generations are identified, with the greatest improvements occurring in dynamic and energetic fields. Such examples include shortwave cloud forcing and 500\&thinsp;hPa eddy geopotential height and relative humidity.

  abstract = {The tropics have long been a focal point of interest in ecology and evolutionary biology - but where actually are the tropics? Classically, the tropics have been defined as all areas lying between 23.4\textdegree{} North and South as these zones receive direct overhead solar radiation at some point during the year. However, a suite of different environmental and climatic characteristics have also been employed to classify regions as tropical or not. The aims of this paper are to 1) briefly review some of the different criteria commonly used to define the tropics, 2) map the extent and distribution of tropical land areas according to these different criteria, and 3) asses the concordance between these criteria and a sample of recent ``tropical'' studies. More specifically, we review eight criteria that are frequently used (implicitly or explicitly) to define the tropics. We then map the location and extent of land areas that are ``definitely tropical'' (i.e., the core tropics) and areas that are ``tropical by most definitions''. Finally, we examine how the different classifications apply to tropical research through an analysis of the study locations of \&gt;200 recent tropical biology articles. Depending on the definition, the extent of the terrestrial tropics ranges from 23 million to 66 million km2 \textendash{} a nearly threefold difference. Likewise, the classification of many areas as being tropical vs. non-tropical depends on the specific criterion employed. Of the tropical studies reviewed here, only 44\% were based on data collected from the core tropics, and 12\% of tropical studies were based on data collected from sites outside of the geographic tropics but with tropical climates. Many different criteria are used to classify areas as tropical vs. non-tropical, leading to inconsistencies when estimating the extent of tropical areas and variation in the classification of ecosystems and species as being tropical vs. non-tropical.},

The goal of this study is to understand the closure of the energy budget in as much detail and precision as possible, within as clean an experimental setup as possible. Radiative kernels and radiative forcing are diagnosed for an aquaplanet simulation under perpetual equinox conditions. The role of the meridional structure of feedbacks, heat transport, and nonlinearities in controlling the local climate response is characterized. Results display a combination of positive subtropical feedbacks and polar amplified warming. These two factors imply a critical role for transport and nonlinear effects, with the latter acting to substantially reduce global climate sensitivity. At the hemispheric scale, a rich picture emerges: anomalous divergence of heat flux away from positive feedbacks in the subtropics; nonlinear interactions among and within clear-sky feedbacks, which reinforce the pattern of tropical cooling and high-latitude warming tendencies; and strong ice-line feedbacks that drive further amplification of polar warming. These results have implications for regional climate predictability, by providing an indication of how spatial patterns in feedbacks combine to affect both the local and nonlocal climate response, and how constraining uncertainty in those feedbacks may constrain the climate response.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The latter lapse rate feedback is subject, at high latitudes, to a myriad of local and remote influences whose relative contributions remain unquantified. The distinct controls on the high-latitude lapse rate feedback are here partitioned into ``upper'' and ``lower'' contributions originating above and below a characteristic climatological isentropic surface that separates the high-latitude lower troposphere from the rest of the atmosphere. This decomposition clarifies how the positive high-latitude lapse rate feedback over polar oceans arises primarily as an atmospheric response to local sea ice loss and is reduced in subpolar latitudes by an increase in poleward atmospheric energy transport. The separation of the locally driven component of the high-latitude lapse rate feedback further reveals how it and the sea-ice albedo feedback together dominate Arctic amplification as a coupled mechanism operating across the seasonal cycle.},

Here, a set of idealized aquaplanet experiments are performed to understand the coupling between high-latitude feedbacks, polar amplification, and the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Results are compared to CMIP5. Simulated climate responses are characterized by a wide range of polar amplification (from none to nearly 15-K warming, relative to the low latitudes) under CO\textsubscript{2} quadrupling. Notably, the high-latitude lapse rate feedback varies in sign among the experiments. The aquaplanet simulation with the greatest polar amplification, representing a transition from perennial to ice-free conditions, exhibits a marked decrease in dry static energy flux by transient eddies. Partly compensating for the reduced poleward energy flux is a contraction of the Ferrel cell and an increase in latent energy flux. Enhanced eddy energy flux is consistent with the upper-tropospheric warming that occurs in all experiments and provides a remote influence on the polar lapse rate feedback. The main conclusions are that (i) given a large, localized change in meridional surface temperature gradient, the midlatitude circulation exhibits strong compensation between changes in dry and latent energy fluxes, and (ii) atmospheric eddies mediate the nonlinear interaction between surface albedo and lapse rate feedbacks, rendering the high-latitude lapse rate feedback less positive than it would be otherwise. Consequently, the variability of the circulation response, and particularly the partitioning of energy fluxes, offers insights into understanding the magnitude of polar amplification.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Feedback analysis offers a characterization of that gradient and hence reveals how uncertainty in physical processes may translate into uncertainty in the circulation response. However, individual feedbacks do not act in isolation. Anomalies associated with one feedback may be compensated by another, as is the case for the positive water vapor and negative lapse rate feedbacks in the tropics. Here a set of idealized experiments are performed in an aquaplanet model to evaluate the coupling between the surface albedo feedback and other feedbacks, including the impact on atmospheric heat transport. In the tropics, the dynamical response manifests as changes in the intensity and structure of the overturning Hadley circulation. Only half of the range of Hadley cell weakening exhibited in these experiments is found to be attributable to imposed, systematic variations in the surface albedo feedback. Changes in extratropical clouds that accompany the albedo changes explain the remaining spread. The feedback-driven circulation changes are compensated by eddy energy flux changes, which reduce the overall spread among experiments. These findings have implications for the efficiency with which the climate system, including tropical circulation and the hydrological cycle, adjusts to high-latitude feedbacks over climate states that range from perennial or seasonal ice to ice-free conditions in the Arctic.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Compared to a simple ice-albedo feedback (temperature-dependent surface albedo), the addition of thermodynamic-ice processes and the seasonal cycle of insolation profoundly affects seasonal polar warming. Climatologically limited-extent ice in the warm season permits only small increases in absorbed solar radiation, producing weak warming, while thick, cold ice in the cold season enables a large radiatively forced response. Despite this enhanced winter warming, the annual-mean polar amplification is modestly reduced by thermodynamic-ice processes. When latent heat transport is disabled, polar amplification is further reduced by a factor of 1.8 across the range of ice representations, suggestive of a nearly additive warming by ice and moist-transport processes.},

Sensitivities of the simulated mesoscale convective system (MCS) properties and feedbacks to large-scale environments are systematically examined against high-resolution geostationary satellite and 3-D mosaic radar observations. MCS precipitation including precipitation amount, diurnal cycle, and distribution of hourly precipitation intensity are reasonably captured by the two simulations despite significant differences in their simulated MCS properties. In general, the Thompson simulation produces better agreement with observations for MCS upper level cloud shield and precipitation area, convective feature horizontal and vertical extents, and partitioning between convective and stratiform precipitation. More importantly, Thompson simulates more stratiform rainfall, which agrees better with observations and results in top-heavier heating profiles from robust MCSs compared to Morrison. A stronger dynamical feedback to the large-scale environment is therefore seen in Thompson, wherein an enhanced mesoscale vortex behind the MCS strengthens the synoptic-scale trough and promotes advection of cool and dry air into the rear of the MCS region. The latter prolongs the MCS lifetimes in the Thompson relative to the Morrison simulations. Hence, different treatment of cloud microphysics not only alters MCS convective-scale dynamics but also has significant impacts on their macrophysical properties such as lifetime and precipitation. As long-lived MCSs produced 2\textendash 3 times the amount of rainfall compared to short-lived ones, cloud microphysics parameterizations have profound impact in simulating extreme precipitation and the hydrologic cycle.},

Paleoproxies indicate that waters of North Atlantic origin were instead absent below 2 km at the Last Glacial Maximum, resulting in an expansion of the volume occupied by Antarctic origin waters. In this study we show that this rearrangement of deep water masses is dynamically linked to the expansion of summer sea ice around Antarctica. A simple theory further suggests that these deep waters only came to the surface under sea ice, which insulated them from atmospheric forcing, and were weakly mixed with overlying waters, thus being able to store carbon for long times. This unappreciated link between the expansion of sea ice and the appearance of a voluminous and insulated water mass may help quantify the ocean's role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide on glacial\textendash interglacial timescales. Previous studies pointed to many independent changes in ocean physics to account for the observed swings in atmospheric carbon dioxide. Here it is shown that many of these changes are dynamically linked and therefore must co-occur.},

Three different stable states are found for exactly the same set of parameters and external forcings: a cold state in which a polar sea ice cap extends into the midlatitudes; a warm state, which is ice free; and a completely sea ice\textendash covered ``snowball'' state. Although low-order energy balance models of the climate are known to exhibit intransitivity (i.e., more than one climate state for a given set of governing equations), the results reported here are the first to demonstrate that this is a property of a complex coupled climate model with a consistent set of equations representing the 3D dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. The coupled model notably includes atmospheric synoptic systems, large-scale circulation of the ocean, a fully active hydrological cycle, sea ice, and a seasonal cycle. There are no flux adjustments, with the system being solely forced by incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}It is demonstrated that the multiple equilibria owe their existence to the presence of meridional structure in ocean heat transport: namely, a large heat transport out of the tropics and a relatively weak high-latitude transport. The associated large midlatitude convergence of ocean heat transport leads to a preferred latitude at which the sea ice edge can rest. The mechanism operates in two very different ocean circulation regimes, suggesting that the stabilization of the large ice cap could be a robust feature of the climate system. Finally, the role of ocean heat convergence in permitting multiple equilibria is further explored in simpler models: an atmospheric GCM coupled to a slab mixed layer ocean and an energy balance model.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

We use the emissions to scale the observationally informed anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and the associated effect on the cloud albedo of present-day ({$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx10"{$>$}Fiedler et al.{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx10"{$>$}2017{$<$}/a{$>$}; {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx29"{$>$}Stevens et al.{$<$}/a{$>$}, {$<$}a href="\#bib1.bibx29"{$>$}2017{$<$}/a{$>$}) into the future. The resulting scenarios in MACv2-SP are then ranked according to their strength in forcing magnitude and spatial asymmetries for anthropogenic aerosol. All scenarios, except SSP3-70 and SSP4-60, show a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol by 2100 with a range from 108\&thinsp;\% to 36\&thinsp;\% of the anthropogenic aerosol optical depth in 2015. We estimate the radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosol from high- and low-end scenarios in the mid-2090s by performing ensembles of simulations with the atmosphere-only configuration of MPI-ESM1.2. MACv2-SP translates the CMIP6 emission scenarios for inducing anthropogenic aerosol forcing. With the implementation in our model, we obtain forcing estimates for both the shortwave instantaneous radiative forcing (RF) and the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of anthropogenic aerosol relative to 1850. Here, ERF accounts for rapid atmospheric adjustments and natural variability internal to the model. The ERF of anthropogenic aerosol for the mid-2090s ranges from -0.15\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2} for SSP1-19 to -0.54\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2} for SSP3-70, i.e. the mid-2090s ERF is 30\&thinsp;\%\textendash 108\&thinsp;\% of the value in the mid-2000s due to differences in the emission pathway alone. Assuming a stronger Twomey effect changes these ERFs to -0.39 and -0.92\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2}, respectively, which are similar to estimates obtained from models with complex aerosol parameterisations. The year-to-year standard deviations around 0.3\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m\textsuperscript{-2} associated with natural variability highlight the necessity to average over sufficiently long time periods for estimating ERF; this is in contrast to RF that is typically well constrained after simulating just 1 year. The scenario interpretation of MACv2-SP will be used within the framework of CMIP6 and other cutting-edge scientific endeavours.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The comparison of trends in various climate indices in observations and models is of fundamental importance for judging the credibility of climate projections. Tropical tropospheric temperature trends have attracted particular attention as this comparison may suggest a model deficiency. One can think of this problem as composed of two parts: one focused on tropical surface temperature trends and the associated issues related to forcing, feedbacks, and ocean heat uptake and a second part focusing on connections between surface and tropospheric temperatures and the vertical profile of trends in temperature. Here we focus on the atmospheric component of the problem. We show that two ensembles of Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory HiRAM model runs (similar results are shown for National Center for Atmospheric Research's CAM4 model) with different commonly used prescribed sea surface temperatures (SSTs), namely, the HadISST1 and ``Hurrell'' data sets, have a difference in upper tropical tropospheric temperature trends ({$\sim$}0.1 K/decade at 300 hPa for the period 1984\textendash 2008) that is about a factor 3 larger than expected from moist adiabatic scaling of the tropical average SST trend difference. We show that this surprisingly large discrepancy in temperature trends is a consequence of SST trend differences being largest in regions of deep convection. Further, trends, and the degree of agreement with observations, not only depend on SST data set and the particular atmospheric temperature data set but also on the period chosen for comparison. Due to the large impact on atmospheric temperatures, these systematic uncertainties in SSTs need to be resolved before the fidelity of climate models' tropical temperature trend profiles can be assessed.},

  abstract = {Climate change simulations made with coupled global climate models typically show a marked hemispheric asymmetry with more warming in the northern high latitudes than in the south. This asymmetry is ascribed to heat uptake by the ocean at high southern latitudes. A recent version of the CCCma climate model exhibits a much more symmetric warming, compared to an earlier version, and agrees somewhat better with observed 20th century trends. This is associated with an improved parameterization of ocean mixing which results in a decrease in heat penetration into the Southern Ocean, in accord with earlier ocean-only and simple coupled model investigations. The global average warming and the net penetration of heat into the global ocean (and hence its thermal expansion) are essentially unchanged. Observed trends in sea-ice extent over the past two decades exhibit hemispheric asymmetry with a statistically significant decrease in northern but not in southern ice cover. Both model versions are consistent with these observations implying that observed ice extent is not yet an indicator of asymmetry in future global warming. Taken together, these results suggest that southern hemisphere climate warming at a rate comparable to that in the northern hemisphere should be considered a realistic possiblity.},

To meet this challenge, we have created robust, observation-based reconstruction ensembles of seasonal Antarctic sea ice extent since 1905. Using these reconstructions, here we show that the observed period since 1979 is the only time all four seasons demonstrate significant increases in total Antarctic sea ice in the context of the twentieth century and that the observed increases are juxtaposed against statistically significant decreases throughout much of the early and middle twentieth century. These reconstructions provide reliable estimates of seasonally resolved total Antarctic sea ice extent and are skilful enough to better understand aspects of air\textendash sea\textendash ice interactions within the Antarctic climate system.},

  abstract = {It is now apparent that observed increases in stratospheric water vapor may have contributed significantly to both stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming over the last few decades. However, a recent study has suggested that our initial estimate of the climate impact may have overestimated both the radiative forcing and stratospheric cooling from these changes. We show that differences between the various estimates are not due to inherent problems with broadband and narrow-band radiation schemes but rather due to the different experimental setups, particularly the altitude of the water vapor change relative to the tropopause used in the radiative calculations. Furthermore, we show that if recent estimates for the observed water vapor trends are valid globally they could have contributed a radiative forcing of up to 0.29 Wm-2 and a lower-stratospheric cooling of more than 0.8 K over the past 20 years, with these values more than doubling if, as has been suggested, the trend has persisted for the last 40 years. This 40 year radiative forcing is roughly 75\% of that due to carbon dioxide alone but, despite its high value, we find that the addition of this forcing into a simple model of climate change still gives global mean surface temperature trends which are consistent with observations.},

This has been led in a concerted international effort by the INTENSE Crosscutting Project of the GEWEX (Global Energy and Water Exchanges) Hydroclimatology Panel. Here, we summarize the main findings so far and suggest future directions for research, including: the benefits of convection-permitting climate modelling; towards understanding mechanisms of change; the usefulness of temperature-scaling relations; towards detecting and attributing extreme rainfall change; and the need for international coordination and collaboration. Evidence suggests that the intensity of long-duration (1 day+) heavy precipitation increases with climate warming close to the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron (CC) rate (6\textendash 7\% K-1), although large-scale circulation changes affect this response regionally. However, rare events can scale at higher rates, and localized heavy short-duration (hourly and sub-hourly) intensities can respond more strongly (e.g. 2\,\texttimes\,CC instead of CC). Day-to-day scaling of short-duration intensities supports a higher scaling, with mechanisms proposed for this related to local-scale dynamics of convective storms, but its relevance to climate change is not clear. Uncertainty in changes to precipitation extremes remains and is influenced by many factors, including large-scale circulation, convective storm dynamics andstratification. Despite this, recent research has increased confidence in both the detectability and understanding of changes in various aspects of intense short-duration rainfall. To make further progress, the international coordination of datasets, model experiments and evaluations will be required, with consistent and standardized comparison methods and metrics, and recommendations are made for these frameworks.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue `Intensification of short-duration rainfall extremes and implications for flash flood risks'.},

Its retreat varies regionally, driven by changes in winds and heating from the atmosphere and ocean.

The location of the summer ice edge is strongly correlated to variability in longwave (infrared) energy emitted by the atmosphere (downward longwave flux; DLF), particularly during the most recent decade when losses have been most rapid. Increasing DLF, in turn, appears to be driven by more clouds and water vapor in spring over the Arctic.},

These effects are particularly evident in autumn and winter consistent with sea-ice loss, but are also apparent in summer, possibly related to earlier snow melt on high-latitude land.

The pace of Arctic warming is two-to-three times that of the globe; this disparity reached a new record high during 2016. While the Arctic spans only a small fraction of the Earth, it plays a disproportionate and multifaceted role in the climate system. In this article, we offer new perspectives on ways in which the Arctic's rapid warming may influence weather patterns in heavily populated regions (the mid-latitudes) of the Northern Hemisphere. Research on this topic has evolved almost as rapidly as the snow and ice have diminished, and while much has been learned, many questions remain. The atmosphere is complex, highly variable, and undergoing a multitude of simultaneous changes, many of which have become apparent only recently. These realities present challenges to robust signal detection and to clear attribution of cause-and-effect.

  abstract = {The pace of change in the arctic system during recent decades has captured the world's attention. Observations and model simulations both indicate that the arctic experiences an amplified response to climate forcing relative to that at lower latitudes. At the core of these changes is the arctic hydrologic system, which includes ice, gaseous vapor in the atmosphere, liquid water in soils and fluvial networks on land, and the freshwater content of the ocean. The changes in stores and fluxes of freshwater have a direct impact on biological systems, not only of the arctic region itself, but also well beyond its bounds. In this investigation, we used a heuristic, graphical approach to distill the system into its fundamental parts, documented the key relationships between those parts as best we know them, and identified the feedback loops within the system. The analysis illustrates relationships that are well understood, but also reveals others that are either unfamiliar, uncertain, or unexplored. The graphical approach was used to provide a visual assessment of the arctic hydrologic system in one possible future state in which the Arctic Ocean is seasonally ice free.},

The Antarctic is known for its near-surface temperature inversion, where the addition of GHGs can lead to increased OLR during all but the winter months. These changes in OLR, however, are unable to explain modeled surface warming due to changes in GHGs across central Antarctica. Here we develop a simple explanation showing why adding always warms the surface, and allowing an estimation of the change in surface temperature due to a change in concentration based on the initial surface temperature. We develop a radiative-advective-turbulent single-column model based on observed temperatures for explicit comparisons between our estimations and model equilibrium behavior. We confirm that Antarctic surface temperatures warm as GHG concentrations increase, and find that this response is best explained through the surface greenhouse effect rather than that of the top of atmosphere (TOA).},

The model consists of the primitive equations on the sphere over zonally symmetric aquaplanet, slab mixed layer ocean boundary conditions, and idealized physical parameterizations including gray radiative transfer and a simplified Betts\textendash Miller convection scheme. This framework allows the authors to study the dependence of Kelvin waves on quantities such as the gross moist stability in a clean manner. A control simulation with the model produces convectively coupled Kelvin waves that are remarkably persistent and dominate the variability within the Tropics. These waves propagate with an equivalent depth of {$\approx$}40 m. Linear regression analysis with respect to a Kelvin-filtered time series shows that the waves are driven by evaporation\textendash wind feedback and have structures broadly consistent with theoretical predictions for Kelvin waves. Next, the determination of the speed and structure of the Kelvin waves is studied by examining the response of the waves to changes in convection scheme parameters. When the convective relaxation time is lengthened, the waves are damped and eventually are completely eliminated. The propagation speed additionally increases with longer relaxation time. Then changes to a convection scheme parameter that essentially controls the fraction of convective versus large-scale precipitation are examined. When some large-scale precipitation occurs, the waves increase in strength, propagate more slowly, and move to larger scales. However, when mostly large-scale precipitation occurs, the Kelvin wave disappears, and the Tropics are dominated by tropical storm\textendash like variability. The decrease in speed is related here to the gross moist stability of the atmosphere, which is reduced with increased large-scale precipitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the effect of a simple convection scheme on the zonally averaged tropical general circulation is examined within an idealized moist GCM to obtain broad classifications of the influence of convection on the Tropics. This is accomplished with a simplified convection scheme in the style of Betts and Miller. The scheme is utilized in a moist GCM with simplified physical parameterizations (gray radiation, with zonally symmetric, slab mixed layer ocean boundary conditions). Comparisons are made with simulations without a convection scheme [i.e., with large-scale condensation (LSC) only], with the moist convective adjustment (MCA) parameterization, and with various formulations and parameter sets with a simplified Betts\textendash Miller (SBM) scheme. With the control run using the SBM scheme, the Tropics become quieter and less dependent on horizontal resolution as compared with the LSC or MCA simulations. The Hadley circulation mass transport is significantly reduced with the SBM scheme, as is the ITCZ precipitation. An important factor determining this behavior is the parameterization of shallow convection: without shallow convection, the convection scheme is largely ineffective at preventing convection from occurring at the grid scale. The sensitivities to convection scheme parameters are also examined. The simulations are remarkably insensitive to the convective relaxation time, and only mildly sensitive to the relative humidity of the reference profile, provided significant large-scale condensation is not allowed to occur. The changes in the zonally averaged tropical circulation that occur in all the simulations are understood based on the convective criteria of the schemes and the gross moist stability of the atmosphere.},

The key elements of the model physics are gray radiative transfer, in which water vapor and other constituents have no effect on radiative fluxes, a simple diffusive boundary layer with prognostic depth, and a mixed layer aquaplanet surface boundary condition. This GCM can be integrated stably without a convection parameterization, with large-scale condensation only, and this study focuses on this simplest version of the model. These simplifications provide a useful framework in which to focus on the interplay between latent heat release and large-scale dynamics. In this paper, the authors study the role of moisture in determining the tropospheric static stability and midlatitude eddy scale. In a companion paper, the effects of moisture on energy transports by baroclinic eddies are discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The authors vary a parameter in the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation to control the amount of water in the atmosphere, and consider circulations ranging from the dry limit to 10 times a control value. The typical length scale of midlatitude eddies is found to be remarkably insensitive to the amount of moisture in the atmosphere in this model. The Rhines scale evaluated at the latitude of the maximum eddy kinetic energy fits the model results for the eddy scale well.

Examining the spatial structure of the stability changes indicates that the difference in the seasonal cycle between hemispheres is due to the behavior over land, which maximizes its stability in winter. Ocean surfaces have qualitatively similar cycles in both hemispheres. It is clear that moist processes are important in determining the static stability in both hemispheres. Although a previously derived moist scaling theory works fairly well to explain the seasonal changes in both hemispheres, it is argued that the large differences in seasonal cycles between land and ocean may indicate different mechanisms at play between the largely ocean-covered SH and the land-dominated NH.},

  abstract = {We use trajectory calculations based on 40-year European Reanalysis (ERA-40) data to predict the water mixing ratio of air entering the stratosphere in the tropics ([H2O]e) and thereby to examine interannual and longer-term changes. [H2O]e is determined from the saturation mixing ratio of the coldest point during ascent from the troposphere to the stratosphere (the Lagrangian cold point). These model predictions for the time variation of [H2O]e agree very well with a broad range of measurements (Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) II, Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), and Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)). During periods when measurements are consistent among various sensors and ERA-40 temperatures show good agreement with radiosondes (1995\textendash 2002), the correlation between model predictions and HALOE water vapor anomalies in the tropical lower stratosphere is r = 0.81, as high as that between HALOE and SAGE II (r = 0.8). The model predictions suggest that the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation, El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, and possibly volcanic eruptions all play a significant role in modulating [H2O]e, leading to interannual anomalies of order 0.5 ppmv with timescales of several months to years. Although the Lagrangian calculations show substantial interannual variability of transport pathways into the stratosphere, the results show that the interannual anomalies of [H2O]e are dominated by anomalies of the zonal mean temperature rather than by transport changes or localized temperature anomalies. This reinforces the paradox of apparently increasing stratospheric water vapor concentrations alongside, if anything, slightly decreasing temperatures at the tropical tropopause. The combination of measurement uncertainties and relatively strong interannual variability with periods of several months to years, on the one hand, limits our ability to detect, attribute, and verify long-term trends and, on the other hand, raises the question as to whether the previously published estimates of long-term trends are too large.},

  abstract = {We present results of Lagrangian troposphere-to-stratosphere transport (TST) in the tropics based on trajectory calculations for the period 1979\textendash 2001. The trajectories and corresponding temperature histories are calculated from wind and temperature fields provided by the reanalysis data ERA-40 of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The water vapor mixing ratio of air entering the tropical stratosphere is calculated from the minimum saturation mixing ratio over ice encountered by each trajectory. We show that this Lagrangian approach, which considers the global-scale to synoptic-scale dynamics of tropical TST but neglects mesoscale dynamics and details of cloud microphysics, substantially improves estimates of stratospheric humidity compared to calculations based on Eulerian mean tropical tropopause temperatures. For the period 1979\textendash 2001 we estimate from the Lagrangian calculation that the mean water mixing ratio of air entering the stratosphere is 3.5 ppmv, which is in good agreement with measurements during the same period, ranging from 3.3 ppmv to 4 ppmv, whereas an estimate based on an Eulerian mean calculation is about 6 ppmv. The amplitude of the annual cycle in water vapor mixing ratio at a potential temperature of 400 K in the tropics estimated from the Lagrangian calculation is compared with measurements of water vapor from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE). For the period 1992\textendash 2001, when HALOE measurements and ERA-40 data overlap, we calculate a peak-to-peak amplitude of {$\sim$}1.7 ppmv, in good agreement with {$\sim$}1.6 ppmv seen in HALOE data. On average, the Lagrangian calculations have a moist bias of {$\sim$}0.2 ppmv, equivalent to a warm bias of the Lagrangian cold point of about 0.5 K. We conclude that the Lagrangian calculation based on synoptic-scale velocity and temperature fields yields estimates for stratospheric water vapor in good agreement with observations and that mesoscale and cloud microphysical processes need not be invoked, at first order, to explain annual mean and seasonal variation of water vapor mixing ratios in the tropical lower stratosphere.},

Laterally, the TTL is bounded by the position of the subtropical jets. We highlight recent progress in understanding of the TTL but emphasize that a number of processes, notably deep, possibly overshooting convection, remain not well understood. The TTL acts in many ways as a ``gate'' to the stratosphere, and understanding all relevant processes is of great importance for reliable predictions of future stratospheric ozone and climate.},

  abstract = {H2O is a key molecule in characterizing atmospheres of temperate terrestrial planets, and observations of transmission spectra are expected to play a primary role in detecting its signatures in the near future. The detectability of H2O absorption features in transmission spectra depends on the abundance of water vapor in the upper part of the atmosphere. We study the three-dimensional distribution of atmospheric H2O for synchronously rotating Earth-sized aquaplanets using the general circulation model (GCM) ROCKE-3D, and examine the effects of total incident flux and stellar spectral type. We observe a more gentle increase of the water vapor mixing ratio in response to increased incident flux than one-dimensional models suggest, in qualitative agreement with the climate-stabilizing effect of clouds around the substellar point previously observed in GCMs applied to synchronously rotating planets. However, the water vapor mixing ratio in the upper atmosphere starts to increase while the surface temperature is still moderate. This is explained by the circulation in the upper atmosphere being driven by the radiative heating due to absorption by water vapor and cloud particles, causing efficient vertical transport of water vapor. Consistently, the water vapor mixing ratio is found to be well-correlated with the near-infrared portion of the incident flux. We also simulate transmission spectra based on the GCM outputs, and show that for the more highly irradiated planets, the H2O signatures may be strengthened by a factor of a few, loosening the observational demands for a H2O detection.},

In previous studies the leading anomaly pattern has been interpreted as representing north\textendash south jet movements, while the second anomaly pattern has been interpreted as representing independent fluctuations in jet strength and width. Here it is shown that these leading anomaly patterns are in fact dependent and together represent north\textendash south movements of the jet. Fluctuations in jet strength, which are approximately inversely proportional to jet width, superimpose upon these dominant north\textendash south meanderings. The distinction between the usual anomaly pattern perspective and this new perspective may have important implications in the interpretation of tropospheric zonal jet variability.},

In this study, using the dropsonde observations, we evaluate the performance of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA2) in representing the Antarctic boundary layer thermodynamic structure. Results show that MERRA2 has a good overall representation of the Antarctic surface stability and correctly predicts 82\% of the SBIs. However, an underprediction of less stable boundary layer occurrence, especially over the elevated East Antarctic plateau, is favored during conditions of increased lower tropospheric stability associated with model dynamics, indicating difficulty in parameterizing turbulence in very stable boundary layers. In addition, a lower tropospheric cool bias (first model level and above) is observed in the MERRA2 reanalysis, especially over West Antarctica, which amplifies in the boundary layer during mixed conditions. The near-surface cold bias is most pronounced when the model fails to predict mixed layers over West Antarctica and is expected to negatively impact the representation of surface energy budget and melt processes.},

Overall, the effect of the critical line emphasized in the Holton\textendash Tan mechanism is less important than the effect of the mean meridional circulation associated with QBO winds for the polar response to the QBO. More specifically, the introduction of easterly winds at the equator near 50 hPa 1) causes enhanced synoptic-scale Eliassen\textendash Palm flux (EPF) convergence in the subtropics from 150 to 50 hPa, which leads to the subtropical critical line moving poleward in the lower stratosphere, and 2) creates a barrier to planetary wave propagation from subpolar latitudes to midlatitudes in the middle and upper stratosphere (e.g., less equatorward EPF near 50\textdegree N), which leads to enhanced planetary wave convergence in the polar vortex region. These two effects are mechanistically distinct; while the former is related to the subtropical critical line, the latter is due to the mean meridional circulation of the QBO. All of these effects are consistent with linear theory, although the evolution of the entire wind distribution is only quasi-linear because induced zonal wind changes cause the wave driving to shift and thereby positively feed back on the zonal wind changes. Finally, downward propagation of the QBO in the equatorial stratosphere, upper stratospheric equatorial zonal wind, and changes in the tropospheric circulation appear to be less important than lower stratospheric easterlies for the polar stratospheric response. Overall, an easterly QBO wind anomaly in the lower stratosphere leads to a weakened stratospheric polar vortex, in agreement with previous studies, although not because of changes in the subtropical critical line.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

As the convection expands to resolved scales, a deepening of the troposphere, a weakening of the Hadley cell, and a moistening of the lower troposphere is found, compared to solutions in which the moist convection is essentially hydrostatic. The growth rate of convective instability is reduced and the convective life cycle is lengthened relative to synoptic phenomena.

At higher latitudes, the strongest near-surface wind events are found to increase in frequency in association with the amplified baroclinicity and poleward shift of the midlatitude storm tracks. The frequency of the heaviest precipitation events increases in all models, despite a systematic reduction of extreme upward vertical velocities, due to the increased moisture content of the lower troposphere.

  abstract = {The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), initiated in 1989 under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme, undertook the systematic validation, diagnosis, and intercomparison of the performance of atmospheric general circulation models. For this purpose all models were required to simulate the evolution of the climate during the decade 1979\textendash 88, subject to the observed monthly average temperature and sea ice and a common prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and solar constant. By 1995, 31 modeling groups, representing virtually the entire international atmospheric modeling community, had contributed the required standard output of the monthly means of selected statistics. These data have been analyzed by the participating modeling groups, by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, and by the more than two dozen AMIP diagnostic subprojects that have been established to examine specific aspects of the models' performance. Here the analysis and validation of the AMIP results as a whole are summarized in order to document the overall performance of atmospheric general circulation\textendash climate models as of the early 1990s. The infrastructure and plans for continuation of the AMIP project are also reported on. Although there are apparent model outliers in each simulated variable examined, validation of the AMIP models' ensemble mean shows that the average large-scale seasonal distributions of pressure, temperature, and circulation are reasonably close to what are believed to be the best observational estimates available. The large-scale structure of the ensemble mean precipitation and ocean surface heat flux also resemble the observed estimates but show particularly large intermodel differences in low latitudes. The total cloudiness, on the other hand, is rather poorly simulated, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The models' simulation of the seasonal cycle (as represented by the amplitude and phase of the first annual harmonic of sea level pressure) closely resembles the observed variation in almost all regions. The ensemble's simulation of the interannual variability of sea level pressure in the tropical Pacific is reasonably close to that observed (except for its underestimate of the amplitude of major El Ni\~nos), while the interannual variability is less well simulated in midlatitudes. When analyzed in terms of the variability of the evolution of their combined space\textendash time patterns in comparison to observations, the AMIP models are seen to exhibit a wide range of accuracy, with no single model performing best in all respects considered. Analysis of the subset of the original AMIP models for which revised versions have subsequently been used to revisit the experiment shows a substantial reduction of the models' systematic errors in simulating cloudiness but only a slight reduction of the mean seasonal errors of most other variables. In order to understand better the nature of these errors and to accelerate the rate of model improvement, an expanded and continuing project (AMIP II) is being undertaken in which analysis and intercomparison will address a wider range of variables and processes, using an improved diagnostic and experimental infrastructure.},

In spring, as the ITCZ migrates off the equator, it jumps poleward and a sudden transition occurs from an eddy-driven, equinoctial regime with two weak Hadley cells, to a near-angular-momentum-conserving, solstitial regime with a strong, cross-equatorial winter-hemisphere cell. Here, the controls on the transition latitude and rate are explored in idealized moist aquaplanet simulations. It is found that the transition remains rapid relative to the solar forcing when year length and slab-ocean heat capacity are varied, and, at Earth's rotation rate, always occurs when the ITCZ reaches approximately 7\textdegree. This transition latitude is, however, found to scale inversely with rotation rate. Interestingly, the transition rate varies nonmonotonically with rotation, with a maximum at Earth's rotation rate, suggesting that Earth may be particularly disposed to a fast monsoon onset. The fast transition relates to feedbacks in both the atmosphere and the slab ocean. In particular, an evaporative feedback between the lower-level branch of the overturning circulation and the surface temperature is identified. This accelerates monsoon onset and slows withdrawal. Last, comparing eddy-permitting and axisymmetric experiments shows that, in contrast with results from dry models, in this fully moist model the presence of eddies slows the migration of the ITCZ between hemispheres.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Recent modelling studies have addressed how an ice shelf may have built up in glacial periods, covering most of the Arctic Ocean7,8. So far, however, there is no irrefutable marine-sediment characterization of such an extensive ice shelf in the Arctic, raising doubt about the impact of glacial conditions on the Arctic Ocean. Here we provide evidence for at least two episodes during which the Arctic Ocean and the adjacent Nordic seas were not only covered by an extensive ice shelf, but also filled entirely with fresh water, causing a widespread absence of thorium-230 in marine sediments. We propose that these Arctic freshwater intervals occurred 70,000\textendash 62,000~years before present and approximately 150,000\textendash 131,000~years before present, corresponding to portions of marine isotope stages~4 and~6. Alternative interpretations of the first occurrence of the calcareous~nannofossil Emiliania huxleyi in Arctic sedimentary records would suggest younger ages for the older interval. Our approach explains the unexpected minima in Arctic thorium-230 records9 that have led to divergent interpretations of sedimentation rates10,11 and hampered their use for dating purposes. About nine million cubic kilometres of fresh water is required to explain our isotopic interpretation, a calculation that we support with estimates of hydrological fluxes and altered boundary conditions. A freshwater mass of this size\textemdash stored in oceans, rather than land\textemdash suggests that a revision of sea-level reconstructions based on freshwater-sensitive stable oxygen isotopes may be required, and that large masses of fresh water could be delivered to the north Atlantic Ocean on very short timescales.},

Model biases in atmospheric dynamics are one of the factors that increase uncertainty in projections of regional climate, precipitation and extreme events. Here we define requirements for diagnosing the atmospheric circulation and variability across temporal scales and for evaluating the transport of mass, momentum and energy by dynamical processes in the context of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). These diagnostics target the assessments of both resolved and parameterized dynamical processes in climate models, a novelty for CMIP, and are particularly vital for assessing the impact of the stratosphere on surface climate change.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This review deals with the consequences of abandoning the TA, based on evidence from numerical and theoretical studies and laboratory and field experiments. The phenomena most affected by the TA include mesoscale flows (Ekman spirals, deep convection, and equatorial jets) and internal waves. Abandoning the TA produces a tilt in convective plumes, produces a dependence on wind direction in Ekman spirals, and gives rise to a plethora of changes in internal wave behavior in weakly stratified layers, such as the existence of trapped short low-frequency waves, and a poleward extension of their habitat. In the astrophysical context of stars and gas giant planets, the TA affects the rate of tidal dissipation and also the patterns of thermal convection.},

  abstract = {The circulation of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical troposphere has changed over recent decades, with marked decreases in extratropical cyclone activity and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in summer and increases in the fraction of precipitation that is convective in all seasons. Decreasing EKE in summer is partly explained by a weakening meridional temperature gradient, but changes in vertical temperature gradients and increasing moisture also affect the mean available potential energy (MAPE), which is the energetic reservoir from which extratropical cyclones draw. Furthermore, the relation of changes in mean thermal structure and moisture to changes in convection associated with extratropical cyclones is poorly understood. Here we calculate trends in MAPE for the Northern extratropics in summer over the years 1979\textendash 2017, and we decompose MAPE into both convective and nonconvective components. Nonconvective MAPE decreased over this period, consistent with decreases in EKE and extratropical cyclone activity, but convective MAPE increased, implying an increase in the energy available to convection. Calculations with idealized atmospheres indicate that nonconvective and convective MAPE both increase with increasing mean surface temperature and decrease with decreasing meridional surface temperature gradient, but convective MAPE is relatively more sensitive to the increase in mean surface temperature. These results connect changes in the atmospheric mean state with changes in both large-scale and convective circulations, and they suggest that extratropical cyclones can weaken even as their associated convection becomes more energetic.},

  abstract = {The extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (Ex-UTLS) is a transition region between the stratosphere and the troposphere. The Ex-UTLS includes the tropopause, a strong static stability gradient and dynamic barrier to transport. The barrier is reflected in tracer profiles. This region exhibits complex dynamical, radiative, and chemical characteristics that place stringent spatial and temporal requirements on observing and modeling systems. The Ex-UTLS couples the stratosphere to the troposphere through chemical constituent transport (of, e.g., ozone), by dynamically linking the stratospheric circulation with tropospheric wave patterns, and via radiative processes tied to optically thick clouds and clear-sky gradients of radiatively active gases. A comprehensive picture of the Ex-UTLS is presented that brings together different definitions of the tropopause, focusing on observed dynamical and chemical structure and their coupling. This integral view recognizes that thermal gradients and dynamic barriers are necessarily linked, that these barriers inhibit mixing and give rise to specific trace gas distributions, and that there are radiative feedbacks that help maintain this structure. The impacts of 21st century anthropogenic changes to the atmosphere due to ozone recovery and climate change will be felt in the Ex-UTLS, and recent simulations of these effects are summarized and placed in context.},

But significant uncertainties remain in microphysical mechanisms for cloud feedback. Important microphysical mechanisms include cloud phase changes, precipitation processes and even aerosol distributions. The treatment of these processes varies across climate models and may contribute to greater spread in feedbacks across models as models advance.

SCAM6 features a wide selection of standard cases, as well as the ability to easily configure a case specified by the user based on a particular point in a CAM 3-D simulation. This work illustrates how SCAM6 reproduces CAM6 results for physical parameterizations, mostly of moisture and clouds. We demonstrate how SCAM6 can be used for model development through different physics selections, as well as with parameter sweep experiments to highlight the sensitivity of cloud properties to the specification of the vapor deposition process in the cloud microphysics. Furthermore, we use SCAM6 to illustrate the sensitivity of CAM6 cloud radiative properties and precipitation to variable drop number (cloud microphysics properties). Finally, we illustrate how SCAM6 can be used to explore critical emergent processes such as cloud feedbacks and show that CAM6 cloud responses to surface warming in stratus and stratocumulus regimes are similar to those in CAM5. CAM6 has a larger response in the shallow cumulus regime than CAM5. CAM6 cloud feedbacks in the shallow cumulus regime are sensitive to turbulence parameters. SCAM6 is thus a valuable tool for model development, evaluation, and scientific analy sis and an important part of the model hierarchy in Community Earth System Model, version 2.},

Comparison of the model simulations reveals common signatures identifiable as products of errors in the boundary conditions. Intermodel differences in the simulated temperature, humidity, cloud, precipitation, and radiative fluxes reflect differences in model resolution or physical parameterizations, although sensitive dependence on initial conditions can also contribute to intermodel differences. All models perform well at times but poorly at others. Although none of the SCM simulations stands out as superior to the others, the simulation by the CEM is in several respects in better agreement with the observations than the simulations by the SCMs. Nudging of the simulated temperature and humidity toward observations generally improves the simulated cloud and radiation fields as well as the simulated temperature and humidity but degrades the precipitation simulation for models with large temperature and humidity biases without nudging. Although some of the intermodel differences have not been explained, others have been identified as model problems that can be or have been corrected as a result of the comparison.},

The dominant 100 kyr oscillation in land ice volume has the familiar sawtooth shape of climate proxy records, and to zeroth order, it does not depend on the seasonal and Milankovitch forcing. The sea ice controls, via its albedo and insulating effects, the atmospheric moisture fluxes and precipitation that enable the land ice sheet growth. This control and the rapid growth and melting of the sea ice allow the sea ice to rapidly switch the climate system from a growing ice sheet phase to a retreating ice sheet phase and to shape the oscillation's sawtooth structure. A specific physical mechanism is proposed by which the insolation changes act as a pacemaker, setting the phase of the oscillation by directly controlling summer melting of ice sheets. This mechanism is shown to induce deglaciations during periods of lower summer insolation. Superimposed on the 100 kyr are the linear Milankovitch-forced frequencies of 19, 23, and 41 kyr. The transition from 41 kyr glacial cycles to 100 kyr cycles one million years ago may be explained as being due to the activation of the sea ice switch at that time. This would be the case if sea ice extent was more limited during the warmer climate of the early Pleistocene.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the available potential energy in the large-scale mean ocean circulation, excluding the boundary layers, is of order (Ba)2 times the kinetic energy, where B is the basin dimension and a = cf is the internal radius of deformation (c is the speed of long internal waves and f the Coriolis parameter). This ratio is of order 1000. The Sverdrup solution for a two-layer ocean is examined, and the rate of input of energy by the wind estimated. In the steady-state model, this energy is lost to the western boundary layer. It is then shown that potential energy available in the mean circulation can be converted into eddy energy by baroclinic instability. The stability properties depend only on the mean density field, and calculations are made for a number of cases. Maximum growth rates are obtained for eddies with wavelength of about 200 km, typical e-folding times being about 80 days. These eddies have significant velocities only in the surface layers. Secondary maxima in the growth rate curves are found for eddies with wavelengths of 300\textendash 500 km, e-folding times being 120 days or more. These eddies have significant velocities in deep water, their structure being something like that of the first baroclinic mode. In the models examined, the conversion of available potential energy took place in the upper 400 m, and the rate of conversion can be related to the maximum eddy velocity. If it is supposed that eddies grow to such a size that mean energy is lost to eddies as fast as it is supplied by the large-scale wind field, then the larger eddies would have maximum velocities of about 0{$\cdot$}08 m s-1 and the smaller surface trapped eddies would have maximum velocities of about 0{$\cdot$}14 m s-1. Observations indicate the existence of eddies of this strength, and with wavelength and periods of the same order as given by the baroclinic instability calculations.},

The primary goals of the Detection and Attribution Model Intercomparison Project (DAMIP) are to facilitate improved estimation of the contributions of anthropogenic and natural forcing changes to observed global warming as well as to observed global and regional changes in other climate variables; to contribute to the estimation of how historical emissions have altered and are altering contemporary climate risk; and to facilitate improved observationally constrained projections of future climate change. D\&amp;A studies typically require unforced control simulations and historical simulations including all major anthropogenic and natural forcings. Such simulations will be carried out as part of the DECK and the CMIP6 historical simulation. In addition D\&amp;A studies require simulations covering the historical period driven by individual forcings or subsets of forcings only: such simulations are proposed here. Key novel features of the experimental design presented here include firstly new historical simulations with aerosols-only, stratospheric-ozone-only, CO\textsubscript{2}-only, solar-only, and volcanic-only forcing, facilitating an improved estimation of the climate response to individual forcing, secondly future single forcing experiments, allowing observationally constrained projections of future climate change, and thirdly an experimental design which allows models with and without coupled atmospheric chemistry to be compared on an equal footing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The simple linear carbon cycle representations in most IAMs are not however physical at long timescales, since ocean carbonate chemistry makes CO2 uptake highly nonlinear. No linearized representation can capture the ocean's dual-mode behavior, with initial rapid uptake and then slow equilibration over {$\backsim$}10,000 years. In a business-as-usual scenario followed by cessation of emissions, the carbon cycle in the 2007 version of the most widely used IAM, DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy), produces errors of {$\backsim$}2{$\circ$}C by the year 2300 and {$\backsim$}6{$\circ$}C by the year 3500. We suggest here a simple alternative representation that captures the relevant physics and show that it reproduces carbon uptake in several more complex models to within the inter-model spread. The scheme involves little additional complexity over the DICE model, making it a useful tool for economic and policy analyses.},

Using a new conceptual model of the global redox system, Goldblatt et al. show that atmospheric oxygen levels could have remained either at a low or a high steady state after oxygenic photosynthesis evolved. The Great Oxidation may have been a switch between these states triggered by a relatively small environmental change. The model suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis alone is insufficient to cause an oxygen-rich atmosphere. So in the absence of additional factors, Earth might have an atmosphere containing only a few parts per million of oxygen, not the 21\% which we enjoy. Equally, oxygenic photosynthesis could conceivably have evolved on planets that only have low levels of atmospheric oxygen.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} We investigate the role which clouds could play in resolving the Faint Young Sun Paradox (FYSP). Lower solar luminosity in the past means that less energy was absorbed on Earth (a forcing of -50 W m\textsuperscript{-2} during the late Archean), but geological evidence points to the Earth having been at least as warm as it is today, with only very occasional glaciations. We perform radiative calculations on a single global mean atmospheric column. We select a nominal set of three layered, randomly overlapping clouds, which are both consistent with observed cloud climatologies and reproduced the observed global mean energy budget of Earth. By varying the fraction, thickness, height and particle size of these clouds we conduct a wide exploration of how changed clouds could affect climate, thus constraining how clouds could contribute to resolving the FYSP. Low clouds reflect sunlight but have little greenhouse effect. Removing them entirely gives a forcing of +25 W m\textsuperscript{-2} whilst more modest reduction in their efficacy gives a forcing of +10 to +15 W m\textsuperscript{-2}. For high clouds, the greenhouse effect dominates. It is possible to generate +50 W m\textsuperscript{-2} forcing from enhancing these, but this requires making them 3.5 times thicker and 14 K colder than the standard high cloud in our nominal set and expanding their coverage to 100\% of the sky. Such changes are not credible. More plausible changes would generate no more than +15 W m\textsuperscript{-2} forcing. Thus neither fewer low clouds nor more high clouds can provide enough forcing to resolve the FYSP. Decreased surface albedo can contribute no more than +5 W m\textsuperscript{-2} forcing. Some models which have been applied to the FYSP do not include clouds at all. These overestimate the forcing due to increased CO\textsubscript{2} by 20 to 25\% when \emph{p}CO\textsubscript{2} is 0.01 to 0.1 bar.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Most solutions rely on changes to the chemical composition of the atmosphere to compensate via a stronger greenhouse effect, whereas physical feedbacks have received less attention. We perform global climate model experiments, using two versions of the Community Atmosphere Model, in which a reduced solar constant is offset by higher CO2. Model runs corresponding to past climate show a substantial decrease in low clouds and hence planetary albedo compared with present, which contributes 40\% of the required forcing to offset the faint Sun. Through time, the climatically important stratocumulus decks have grown in response to a brightening Sun and decreasing greenhouse effect, driven by stronger cloud-top radiative cooling (which drives low cloud formation) and a stronger inversion (which sustains clouds against dry air entrainment from above). We find that systematic changes to low clouds have had a major role in stabilizing climate through Earth's history, which demonstrates the importance of physical feedbacks on long-term climate stabilization, and a smaller role for geochemical feedbacks.},

The radiative forcing at the tropopause due to CO2 changes within SRES scenarios and across Quaternary glacial cycles is represented with reasonable accuracy, suggesting that surface temperature will be correctly predicted. However, this is achieved by partial cancellation of opposing errors in upward and downward fluxes. The changes in the vertical profiles of radiative fluxes and the changes to surface and top-of-atmosphere fluxes all show significant errors, even at twice pre-industrial CO2. This causes a sign error in the change in the convective flux in the radiative\textendash convective model. Performance of the code deteriorates rapidly above four times pre-industrial CO2. For less-abundant greenhouse gases, CH4 and N2O, the errors are larger as a proportion of their radiative forcings. Errors for surface and top-of-atmosphere fluxes for CO2 are similar to those from the mean of the general circulation model (GCM) codes submitted to the intercomparison of radiation codes for IPCC AR4, implying that errors as found here may not be uncommon in climate models. A renewed emphasis on accuracy in radiative transfer calculations and openness in intercomparison studies is necessary to improve the modelling of climate change.

I map these as a function of solar constant for planets ranging in size from Mars-sized to 10 Earth-mass. The states are as follows: globally ice covered (Ts{$\lessapprox$}245\,K), cold and damp (270{$\lessapprox$}Ts{$\lessapprox$}290\,K), hot and moist (350{$\lessapprox$}Ts{$\lessapprox$}550\,K), and very hot and dry (Tsx2A86;900\,K). No stable climate exists for 290{$\lessapprox$}Ts {$\lessapprox$}350\,K or 550{$\lessapprox$}Ts{$\lessapprox$}900\,K. The union of hot moist and cold damp climates describes the liquid water habitable zone, the width and location of which depends on planet mass. At each solar constant, two or three different climate states are stable. This is a consequence of strong nonlinearities in both thermal emission and the net absorption of sunlight. Across the range of planet sizes, I account for the atmospheres expanding to high altitudes as they warm. The emitting and absorbing surfaces (optical depth of unity) move to high altitude, making their area larger than the planet surface, so more thermal radiation is emitted and more sunlight absorbed (the former dominates). The atmospheres of small planets expand more due to weaker gravity; the effective runaway greenhouse threshold is about 35\,W m-2 higher for Mars, 10\,W m-2 higher for Earth or Venus, but only a few W m-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet. There is an underlying (expansion-neglected) trend of increasing runaway greenhouse threshold with planetary size (40\,W m-2 higher for a 10 Earth-mass planet than for Mars). Summing these opposing trends means that Venus-sized (or slightly smaller) planets are most susceptible to a runaway greenhouse. The habitable zone for pure water atmospheres is very narrow, with an insolation range of 0.07 times the solar constant. A wider habitable zone requires background gas and greenhouse gas: N2 and CO2 on Earth, which are biologically controlled. Thus, habitability depends on inhabitance.

However, the Earth was not permanently glaciated, an apparent contradiction known as the faint young Sun paradox. By implication, the Earth must have been warmed by a stronger greenhouse effect or a lower planetary albedo. Here we use a radiative\textendash convective climate model to show that more N2 in the atmosphere would have increased the warming effect of existing greenhouse gases by broadening their absorption lines. With the atmospheric CO2 and CH4 levels estimated for 2.5\,billion years ago, a doubling of the present atmospheric nitrogen (PAN) level would cause a warming of 4.4 {$\circ$}C. Our new budget of Earth's geological nitrogen reservoirs indicates that there is a sufficient quantity of nitrogen in the crust (0.5~PAN) and mantle ({$>$}1.4 PAN) to have supported this, and that this nitrogen was previously in the atmosphere. In the mantle, N correlates with 40Ar, the daughter product of 40K, indicating that the source of mantle N is subducted crustal rocks in which NH4+ has been substituted for K+. We thus conclude that a higher nitrogen level probably helped warm the early Earth, and suggest that the effects of N2 should be considered in assessing the habitable zone for terrestrial planets.},

For deep palaeoclimate, and increasingly terrestrial exoplanet climate science, this brings both the joy and the challenge of exotic atmospheric compositions. The challenge here is that most standard radiation codes for climate modelling have been developed for modern atmospheric conditions and may perform poorly away from these. The palaeoclimate or exoclimate modeller must either rely on these or use bespoke radiation codes, and in both cases rely on either blind faith or ad hoc testing of the code. In this paper, we describe the protocols for the Palaeoclimate and Terrestrial Exoplanet Radiative Transfer Model Intercomparison Project (PALAEOTRIP) to systematically address this. This will compare as many radiation codes used for palaeoclimate or exoplanets as possible, with the aim of identifying the ranges of far-from-modern atmospheric compositions in which the codes perform well.

  abstract = {Hydrothermal plumes may be responsible for transmitting radiogenic or tidally generated heat from Europa's rocky interior through a liquid ocean to the base of its ice shell. This process has been implicated in the formation of chaos regions and lenticulae by melting or exciting convection in the ice layer. In contrast to earlier work, we argue that Europa's ocean should be treated as an unstratified fluid. We have adapted and expanded upon existing work describing buoyant plumes in a rotating, unstratified environment. We discuss the scaling laws governing the flow and geometry of plumes on Europa and perform a laboratory experiment to obtain scaling constants and to visualize plume behavior in a Europa-like parameter regime. We predict that hydrothermal plumes on Europa are of a lateral scale (at least 25\textendash 50 km) comparable to large chaos regions; they are too broad to be responsible for the formation of individual lenticulae. Plume heat fluxes (0.1\textendash 10 W/m2) are too weak to allow complete melt-through of the ice layer. Current speeds in the plume (3\textendash 8 mm/s) are much slower than indicated by previous studies. The observed movement of ice blocks in the Conamara Chaos region is unlikely to be driven by such weak flow.},

The reanalyses are evaluated using observations from the Norwegian Young Sea Ice campaign (N-ICE2015), a 5-month ice drift in pack ice north of Svalbard. N-ICE2015 observations include surface meteorology, vertical profiles from radiosondes, as well as radiative and turbulent heat fluxes. The reanalyses simulate surface analysis variables well throughout the campaign, but have difficulties with most forecast variables. Wintertime (January\textendash March) correlation coefficients between the reanalyses and observations are above 0.90 for the surface pressure, 2-m temperature, total column water vapor, and downward longwave flux. However, all reanalyses have a positive wintertime 2-m temperature bias, ranging from 1\textdegree{} to 4\textdegree C, and negative (i.e., upward) net longwave bias of 3\textendash 19 W m\textsuperscript{-2}. These biases are associated with poorly represented surface inversions and are largest during cold-stable periods. Notably, the recent ERA5 and ASRv2 datasets have some of the largest temperature and net longwave biases, respectively. During spring (April\textendash May), reanalyses fail to simulate observed persistent cloud layers. Therefore they overestimate the net shortwave flux (5\textendash 79 W m\textsuperscript{-2}) and underestimate the net longwave flux (8\textendash 38 W m\textsuperscript{-2}). Promisingly, ERA5 provides the best estimates of downward radiative fluxes in spring and summer, suggesting improved forecasting of Arctic cloud cover. All reanalyses exhibit large negative (upward) residual heat flux biases during winter, and positive (downward) biases during summer. Turbulent heat fluxes over sea ice are simulated poorly in all seasons.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, representations of silicate weathering used in current estimates of the effective outer edge of the HZ account for neither the thermodynamic limit on the concentration of weathering products in runoff set by clay precipitation nor the energetic limit on precipitation set by planetary instellation. We find that when the thermodynamic limit is included in an idealized coupled climate/weathering model, the steady-state planetary climate loses sensitivity to silicate dissolution kinetics, becoming sensitive to temperature primarily through the effect of temperature on runoff and to through an effect on solute concentration mediated by pH. This increases sensitivity to land fraction, outgassing, and geological factors such as soil age and lithology, all of which are found to have a profound effect on the position of the effective outer edge of the HZ. The interplay between runoff sensitivity and the energetic limit on precipitation leads to novel warm states in the outer reaches of the HZ, owing to the decoupling of temperature and precipitation. We discuss strategies for detecting the signature of the silicate weathering feedback through exoplanet observations in light of insights derived from the revised picture of weathering.},

It is shown that the terms in the TKE budgets for both sets of simulations scale in the same way, but that the non-dimensional profiles are different. It is suggested that this is associated with the effects of sublimation of ice.

There is general agreement that the Arctic amplification of the surface air temperature (SAT) trend to a considerable extent is due to local effects such as the retreat of sea ice, especially during the summer months, and earlier melting of snow in the spring season. There is no doubt that these processes are important causes of the Arctic SAT trend. It is less clear, however, whether the trend may also be related to recent changes in the atmospheric midlatitude circulation. This question is the focus of the present paper.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Model experiments have shown that in a warmer climate responding to, for example, a doubling of CO\textsubscript{2}, the atmospheric northward energy transport (ANET) will increase and cause polar SAT amplification. In the present study, the development of the ANET across 60\textdegree N and its linkage to the Arctic SAT have been explored using the ERA-40 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is found that during 1979\textendash 2001, the ANET has experienced an overall positive but weak trend, which was largest during the period from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. In addition, it is found that the Arctic SAT is sensitive to variability of the ANET across 60\textdegree N and hence to variability of the midlatitude circulation: A large ANET is followed by warming of the Arctic where ANET leads by about 5 days. The warming is located primarily north of the Atlantic and Pacific sectors, indicating that baroclinic weather systems developing around the Icelandic and Aleutian lows are important for the energy transport. Furthermore, it is suggested here that a small, but statistically significant, part of the mean Arctic SAT trend is linked to the trend in the ANET.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Another important indicator of the midlatitude circulation is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Through the 1980s and early 1990s the AO index has shown a positive trend.

The role of the ice-albedo feedback for the Arctic amplification is still a matter of debate. Here the effect of the surface-albedo feedback (SAF) was studied using a coupled climate model CCSM3 from the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Experiments, where the SAF was suppressed by locking the surface albedo in the entire coupled model system, were conducted. The results reveal polar temperature amplification when this model, with suppressed albedo, is forced by a doubling of the atmospheric CO2 content. Comparisons with variable albedo experiments show that SAF amplifies the surface-temperature response in the Arctic area by about 33\%, whereas the corresponding value for the global-mean surface temperature is about 15\%. Even though SAF is an important process underlying excessive warming at high latitudes, the Arctic amplification is only 15\% larger in the variable than in the locked-albedo experiments. It is found that an increase of water vapour and total cloud cover lead to a greenhouse effect, which is larger in the Arctic than at lower latitudes. This is expected to explain a part of the Arctic surface\textendash air-temperature amplification.},

The transport is accomplished by atmospheric waves\textendash for instance large-scale planetary waves and meso-scale cyclones\textendash and the zonal-mean circulation. These different components of the energy transport impact the Arctic climate differently. A split of the transport into stationary and transient waves constitutes a traditional way of decomposing the transport. However this procedure does not take into account the transport accomplished separately by the planetary and synoptic-scale waves. Here a Fourier decomposition is applied, which decomposes the transport with respect to zonal wave numbers. Reanalysis and model data reveal that the planetary waves impact Arctic temperatures much more than do synoptic-scale waves. In addition the latent transport by these waves affects the Arctic climate more than does the dry-static part. Finally, the EC-Earth model suggests that changes of the energy transport over the twentyfirst century will contribute to Arctic warming, despite the fact that in this model the total energy transport to the Arctic will decrease. This apparent contradictory result is due to the cooling induced by a decrease of the dry-static transport by planetary waves being more than compensated for by a warming caused by the latent counterpart.},

The lapse rate feedback is negative at low latitudes, as a result of moist convective processes, and positive at high latitudes, due to stable stratification conditions that effectively trap warming near the surface. It is shown that this feedback pattern leads to polar amplification of the temperature response induced by a radiative forcing. The results are obtained by suppressing the lapse rate feedback in the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). The lapse rate feedback accounts for 15\% of the Arctic amplification and 20\% of the amplification in the Antarctic region. The fraction of the amplification that can be attributed to the surface albedo feedback, associated with melting of snow and ice, is 40\% in the Arctic and 65\% in Antarctica. It is further found that the surface albedo and lapse rate feedbacks interact considerably at high latitudes to the extent that they cannot be considered independent feedback mechanisms at the global scale.},

  abstract = {The transfer of heat and momentum by motion on the scale of cyclone waves and long waves is deduced from a knowledge of their mechanics. The law of horizontal transfer of entropy is independent of notions of mixing but is similar to that for non-isotropic diffusion. The law accurately represents the annual variation of heat-flux in the Northern Hemisphere. Perturbation theory suggests realistic spatial variations for the transfer and provides a rational basis for calculating transfer coefficients which can then be used to find the flux of other conservative quantities. Most importantly the Equatorward flux of potential vorticity is well defined and is shown to determine the horizontal flux of momentum uv. The mean surface winds, and the mean meridional circulation (which is seen to be frictionally driven) are then determined. A model of the general circulation is defined by these properties, and this is integrated analytically for a simplified case and compared with motion observed in the Gulf Stream, the mesosphere, and dishpan experiments as well as the troposphere.},

This `steady-eddy' state is itself unstable in a sense, and its breakdown suggests the catastrophic onset of a cascade of turbulence. The mechanics of this cascade can be represented by a kind of recursion system in which the turbulence dynamics of one scale is repeated in the next, and a law of turbulent stress results.

Paleontological data indicate mild temperatures even at high latitudes and in mid-latitude continental interiors, whereas computer simulations of continental paleoclimates produce winter temperatures closer to modern levels. Foliar physiognomy and floristic composition of 23 Eocene floras from the interior of North America and Australia indicate cold month means generally \&gt;2 \textdegree C, even where the mean annual temperature (MAT) was \&lt;15 \textdegree C.

Latitudinal temperature gradients reconstructed here are broadly representative of Eocene climates, showing that the discrepancy between proxy data and simulations will not be resolved by regional adjustments to paleogeography or reinterpretation of individual fossil assemblages.

We identify four possible contributory effects. First, the surface climate system loses heat less readily into the ocean beneath as the latter warms. The model spread in the thermal coupling between the upper and deep ocean largely explains the model spread in ocean heat uptake efficiency. Second, CO2 radiative forcing may rise more rapidly than logarithmically with CO2 concentration. Third, the climate feedback parameter may decline as the CO2 concentration rises. With CMIP5 data, we cannot distinguish the second and third possibilities. Fourth, the climate feedback parameter declines as time passes or T rises; in 1pctCO2, this effect is less important than the others. We find that T projected for the end of the twenty-first century correlates more highly with T at the time of quadrupled CO2 in 1pctCO2 than with the TCR, and we suggest that the TCR may be underestimated from observed climate change.},

It is particularly motivated by the uncertainties in projections of ocean heat uptake, global-mean sea-level rise due to thermal expansion and the geographical patterns of sea-level change due to ocean density and circulation change. FAFMIP has three tier-1 experiments, in which prescribed surface flux perturbations of momentum, heat and freshwater respectively are applied to the ocean in separate AOGCM simulations. All other conditions are as in the pre-industrial control. The prescribed fields are typical of pattern and magnitude of changes in these fluxes projected by AOGCMs for doubled CO\textsubscript{2} concentration. Five groups have tested the experimental design with existing AOGCMs. Their results show diversity in the pattern and magnitude of changes, with some common qualitative features. Heat and water flux perturbation cause the dipole in sea-level change in the North Atlantic, while momentum and heat flux perturbation cause the gradient across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) declines in response to the heat flux perturbation, and there is a strong positive feedback on this effect due to the consequent cooling of sea-surface temperature in the North Atlantic, which enhances the local heat input to the ocean. The momentum and water flux perturbations do not substantially affect the AMOC. Heat is taken up largely as a passive tracer in the Southern Ocean, which is the region of greatest heat input, while the weakening of the AMOC causes redistribution of heat towards lower latitudes. Future analysis of these and other phenomena with the wider range of CMIP6 FAFMIP AOGCMs will benefit from new diagnostics of temperature and salinity tendencies, which will enable investigation of the model spread in behaviour in terms of physical processes as formulated in the models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS, in K) to \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ doubling is a large source of uncertainty in projections of future anthropogenic climate change. Estimates of ECS made from non-equilibrium states or in response to radiative forcings other than \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{2\}\textbackslash times \textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ are called ``effective climate sensitivity'' (EffCS, in K). Taking a ``perfect-model'' approach, using coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) experiments, we evaluate the accuracy with which \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ EffCS can be estimated from climate change in the ``historical'' period (since about 1860). We find that (1) for statistical reasons, unforced variability makes the estimate of historical EffCS both uncertain and biased; it is overestimated by about 10\% if the energy balance is applied to the entire historical period, 20\% for 30-year periods, and larger factors for interannual variability, (2) systematic uncertainty in historical radiative forcing translates into an uncertainty of \$\$\{\textbackslash pm \}\textbackslash,30\textbackslash, \{\textbackslash rm to\} \textbackslash,45\textbackslash\%\$\$ (standard deviation) in historical EffCS, (3) the response to the changing relative importance of the forcing agents, principally \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ and volcanic aerosol, causes historical EffCS to vary over multidecadal timescales by a factor of two. In recent decades it reached its maximum in the AOGCM historical experiment (similar to the multimodel-mean \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ EffCS of 3.6 K from idealised experiments), but its minimum in the real world (1.6 K for an observational estimate for 1985\textendash 2011, similar to the multimodel-mean value for volcanic forcing). The real-world variations mean that historical EffCS underestimates \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ EffCS by 30\% when considering the entire historical period. The difference for recent decades implies that either unforced variability or the response to volcanic forcing causes a much stronger regional pattern of sea surface temperature change in the real world than in AOGCMs. We speculate that this could be explained by a deficiency in simulated coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean feedbacks which reinforce the pattern (resembling the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation in some respects) that causes the low EffCS. We conclude that energy-balance estimates of \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ EffCS are most accurate from periods unaffected by volcanic forcing. Atmosphere GCMs provided with observed sea surface temperature for the 1920s to the 1950s, which was such a period, give a range of about 2.0\textendash 4.5 K, agreeing with idealised \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ AOGCM experiments; the consistency is a reason for confidence in this range as an estimate of \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$ EffCS. Unless another explosive volcanic eruption occurs, the first 30 years of the present century may give a more accurate energy-balance historical estimate of this quantity.},

The method is simply to regress the top of atmosphere radiative flux against the global average surface air temperature change. This method does not require special integrations or off-line estimates, such as for stratospheric adjustment, to obtain the forcing, and eliminates the need for double radiation calculations and tropopause radiative fluxes. We show that for CO2 and solar forcing in a slab model and an AOGCM the method gives results consistent with those obtained by conventional methods. For a single integration it is less precise but since it does not require a steady state to be reached its precision could be improved by running an ensemble of short integrations.},

This study decomposes the atmospheric circulation response to CO2 forcing in CMIP5 models into two components: a direct component due to CO2 radiative forcing and an indirect component associated with sea surface temperature (SST)-mediated changes. The direct radiative forcing of CO2 drives a weak poleward jet shift in both hemispheres, whereas the indirect (SST) component of the CO2 forcing dominates the total response and drives a zonally asymmetric response in the NH. Hence, understanding the SST-mediated component of atmospheric CO2 forcing appears crucial to unlocking the mechanisms that contribute to forced extratropical circulation changes.},

Intuitively, eddy energy can be generated, dissipated, and fluxed from place to place; regions where the budget balances generation and dissipation are ``local'' and regions that export or import large amounts of eddy energy are ``nonlocal.'' Many mesoscale parameterizations assume that statistics of the unresolved eddies behave as local functions of the resolved large scales, and studies that relate doubly periodic simulations to ocean patches must assume that the ocean patches have local energetics. This study derives and diagnoses the eddy energy budget in simulations of wind-driven gyres. To more closely approximate the ideas of subgrid-scale parameterization, the authors define the mean and eddies using a spatial filter rather than the more common time average. The eddy energy budget is strongly nonlocal over nearly half the domain in the simulations. In particular, in the intergyre region the eddies lose energy through interactions with the mean, and this energy loss can only be compensated by nonlocal flux of energy from elsewhere in the domain. This study also runs doubly periodic simulations corresponding to ocean patches from basin simulations. The eddy energy level of ocean patches in the basin simulations matches the level in the periodic simulations only in regions with local eddy energy budgets.},

These events are associated with large scale meteorological patterns (LSMPs). The statistics, dynamics, and modeling sections of this paper are written to be autonomous and so can be read separately. Methods to define extreme events statistics and to identify and connect LSMPs to extreme temperature events are presented. Recent advances in statistical techniques connect LSMPs to extreme temperatures through appropriately defined covariates that supplement more straightforward analyses. Various LSMPs, ranging from synoptic to planetary scale structures, are associated with extreme temperature events. Current knowledge about the synoptics and the dynamical mechanisms leading to the associated LSMPs is incomplete. Systematic studies of: the physics of LSMP life cycles, comprehensive model assessment of LSMP-extreme temperature event linkages, and LSMP properties are needed. Generally, climate models capture observed properties of heat waves and cold air outbreaks with some fidelity. However they overestimate warm wave frequency and underestimate cold air outbreak frequency, and underestimate the collective influence of low-frequency modes on temperature extremes. Modeling studies have identified the impact of large-scale circulation anomalies and land\textendash atmosphere interactions on changes in extreme temperatures. However, few studies have examined changes in LSMPs to more specifically understand the role of LSMPs on past and future extreme temperature changes. Even though LSMPs are resolvable by global and regional climate models, they are not necessarily well simulated. The paper concludes with unresolved issues and research questions.},

A companion paper describes the creation and validation of these new moisture budget products [Groves and Francis, 2002]. Seasonal differences in moisture transport arise from distinct winter/summer circulation regimes and meridional moisture gradients. In winter, approximately 80\% of the net precipitation (precipitation minus evaporation, P-E) is transported along well-defined storm tracks. Summer P-E is double that of winter and dominates the annual pattern. Decadal differences in winter P-E reveal statistically significant increases in the Beaufort and eastern Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas, decreases in the Canadian Archipelago (islands in far northeast Canada) and Kara Sea, and a slight increase in the Arctic as a whole. Annual differences are dominated by winter changes. When the phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index is positive, the net PW flux across 70\textdegree N in winter is 6 times larger than on negative-index days. Over the entire Arctic, P-E is 29\% larger (20\% lower) than the average on days with a positive (negative) AO index. In summer the PW transport is twice as large, and P-E is 27\% higher on positive versus negative AO days. These results suggest that if the AO continues its trend toward a predominantly positive phase, we should expect to observe increasing precipitation in the Arctic overall, and particularly in regions adjacent to the marginal ice zones.},

In this work, the COSMIC GPS radio occultation dataset is used to investigate this issue. The ratio of the strength of the SH storm tracks to that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) based on the COSMIC dataset can be regarded as close to the true inter-hemisphere ratio since the dataset has similar biases and errors in both hemispheres. Comparing this ratio with that based on the reanalysis, it is found that the strength of the SH storm tracks in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis is significantly biased low by at least 25\% at 300 hPa, while those in the ECMWF reanalyses are much closer to that inferred from COSMIC observations but ERA40 may be biased low by 5\textendash 10\%.},

The procedure developed involves reducing the thermal inertia of the ocean and increasing the frequency of the solar forcing cycle during an acceleration period. Determining the appropriate duration and ending time for the acceleration is important, especially for avoiding problems posed by the annual temperature cycle. We present a method for calculating the ending time that requires no knowledge beforehand about details of the model's behavior other than an estimate of the temperature cycle's lag behind the solar forcing cycle. Uncertainties about the coupling between a model's atmosphere and ocean limit the degree of allowable acceleration. Model noise can also limit successful application if high accuracy is demanded. Using a numerical climate model, we obtain savings of over 50\% in the amount of time necessary to reach convergence. Our success occurs in part because the accelerated integration's time average temperature field is nearly the same as that of the nonaccelerated integration. The procedure will be less effective in a model whose time average temperature is instead a strong function of the degree of acceleration. The procedure developed is simple to apply and can allow more extensive use of these models to study climate change.},

  abstract = {We incorporate physically based parameterizations of atmospheric meridional heat fluxes into the climate model of Wang et al. (1984) to study their effects on climate changes caused by increases of CO2 abundance and solar constant variations. The physically based parameterizations calculate both the magnitudes and profiles of the sensible and latent heat fluxes in good agreement with observations. Comparisons of climate sensitivity between the physically based parameterizations and the original model's empirical parameterization for total transport are performed. The results indicate that both parameterizations yield about the same changes in global mean surface temperature and ice line, but the physically based parameterizations produce smaller changes in meridional temperature gradient. Also, the sensible and latent heat fluxes from the physical parameterization produce mutually compensating changes which are consistent with general circulation model results. We also study the separate feedback effects of sensible and latent heat fluxes by allowing only one or the other to change during climate changes. It is found that these variations in the partitioning of changes in the meridional heat transport have relatively small effects on the change of hemispheric mean surface temperature, but they can affect both the sign as well as the magnitude of the change of meridional temperature gradient. The change in total meridional heat transport is also relatively insensitive to the partitioning variations. Further analysis of the model's energy balance indicates that this insensitivity is a consequence of two features of the results: (1) absorption of the latitudinally varying part of the solar heating is affected very little by the partitioning, and (2) thermal structure changes that are affected by the partitioning do not influence greatly the zonal energy balance.},

How condensation affects the structural evolution of eddies, their fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum, and their subsequent interaction with the zonal average state was examined. Initial states corresponded to climatological winter and summer zonal average states. For most experiments the perturbation had a fundamental zonal wavenumber 7, representing an appropriate scale for transient eddies that reach substantial amplitudes in the atmosphere. Additional experiments used fundamental wavenumber 4, 10, or 14. The wave's vertical motion produced midtropospheric supersaturation whose heating further amplified the vertical motion. Consequently, the largest effects of condensation were associated with vertical transports. Compared to corresponding dry experiments, intensified vertical motions increased the maximum kinetic energy attained by the wave, but they also depleted the eddy available potential energy more rapidly, thus inducing a faster evolution of the life cycle. Even greater condensation occurred near the surface as warm, moist air moving poleward became supersaturated by heat loss into a cooler surface. However, the latent heat thus released was balanced by the heat loss into the surface and so produced no dynamical effect. The hydrological cycle induced by the wave was largely confined to the lower troposphere, but the strongest effects of condensation on eddy dynamics occurred in the upper troposphere, so the condensational heating altered only weakly the intensity of the wave-induced moisture cycle.},

  abstract = {Abstract We use a global, primitive equation model to study the evolution of waves growing in a zonal mean state that is initially baroclinically unstable. The waves produce changes in the zonal mean state that we compare with changes predicted by baroclinic adjustment theories We examine mean state adjustment by representative zonal wavenumbers 3, 7 or 12. In the absence of surface processes, as the wave grows to its maximum amplitude, it reduces the zonal mean state's potential vorticity gradient through the lower troposphere, in accord with adjustment theories. Over the latitudes with largest wave amplitude, changes in the static stability and the zonal wind's vertical shear contribute about equally to the potential vorticity gradient adjustment. However, during the last day of a wave's growth, momentum fluxes strengthen the barotropic component of the zonal wind and the potential vorticity gradient in the middle troposphere, changes that are not anticipated by adjustment theory. The static stability adjustment occurs across the latitudinal band occupied by the growing wave. Further experiments show that the static stability adjustment alone is very effective in reducing the instability of the flow and restricting the maximum amplitude attained by growing waves. Adjustment of the zonal wind's vertical shear is confined to a narrower range of latitude and is partially reversed as the wave decays. Additional experiments indicate that the barotropic governor mechanism of James does not contribute strongly to the mean flow's stabilization in the cases we examine, though it way inhibit secondary growth at latitudes adjacent to the initial disturbance. When the model includes surface friction and heat flux, the waves adjust the zonal mean state less effectively, especially near the surface. Surface heat flux inhibits static stability adjustment, and surface friction inhibits adjustment of the zonal wind's vertical shear. In the absence of surface processes, the adjusted state produced by the wave is quite different from observed mean structures. However, with both surface processes included, the vertical profiles of the adjusted static stability, wind shear and potential vorticity gradient are similar to observed profiles. The model' interaction between the waves and the mean flow corroborates results from previous studies of baroclinic adjustment that used simpler representations of atmospheric dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract The authors examine the role of convection in the dynamics of eddy life cycles through numerical experiments using initial states that are baroclinically and conditionally unstable in midlatitudes. The location of wave-induced convection and its influence on the growing wave depends on how strongly the wave is coupled to the lower boundary through surface fluxes. For all three convective schemes used here (Emanuel, modified Grell, modified Kuo), convective destabilization is favored in the wave's warm sector when there are no surface fluxes included in the simulation and in the cold sector when there are. Convection is also shallower when it occurs in the cold sector, though still precipitating. For simulations using Emanuel convection, the relatively shallow convection plays a central role in a water cycle wherein 1) evaporation gives moisture to the cold sector's boundary layer, 2) convection pumps some of the moisture into the lower troposphere above the boundary layer, 3) the large-scale circulation transports the moisture eastward and upward into the wave's warm sector, and 4) stable precipitation condenses the moisture into precipitation. The additional condensation catalyzes a more energetic life cycle by inducing stronger vertical motion and, hence, a greater conversion of available potential energy to kinetic energy. This enhancement, however, is parameterization dependent, with the key factor being how much lower-tropospheric moistening a convection scheme produces.},

In the dry heatwave region, anticyclonic circulation has been amplified after the onset of heatwaves under the influence of the convergence of anomalous wave activity flux over northern EA, resulting in surface warming via adiabatic processes. In contrast, the moist heatwaves are triggered by the locally generated anticyclonic anomalies, with the surface warming amplified by cloud and water vapor feedback.

While Antarctic surface elevation has been implicated in promoting a weaker Antarctic lapse rate feedback, the mechanisms in which elevation impacts the lapse rate feedback are still unclear. Here we suggest that weaker Antarctic warming under CO2 forcing stems from shallower, less intense climatological inversions due to limited atmospheric heat transport above the ice sheet elevation and elevation-induced katabatic winds. In slab ocean model experiments with flattened Antarctic topography, stronger climatological inversions support a stronger lapse rate feedback and annual mean Antarctic warming comparable to the Arctic under CO2 doubling. Unlike the Arctic, seasonality in warming over flat Antarctica is mainly driven by a negative shortwave cloud feedback, which exclusively dampens summer warming, with a smaller contribution from the winter-enhanced lapse rate feedback.},

CMIP6 models broadly capture the observed pattern of surface- and winter-dominated Arctic warming that has outpaced both tropical and Antarctic warming in recent decades. For both CMIP5 and CMIP6, CO2 quadrupling experiments reveal that the lapse-rate and surface albedo feedbacks contribute most to stronger warming in the Arctic than the tropics or Antarctic. The relative strength of the polar surface albedo feedback in comparison to the lapse-rate feedback is sensitive to the choice of radiative kernel, and the albedo feedback contributes most to intermodel spread in polar warming at both poles. By separately calculating moist and dry atmospheric heat transport, we show that increased poleward moisture transport is another important driver of Arctic amplification and the largest contributor to projected Antarctic warming. Seasonal ocean heat storage and winter-amplified temperature feedbacks contribute most to the winter peak in warming in the Arctic and a weaker winter peak in the Antarctic. In comparison with CMIP5, stronger polar warming in CMIP6 results from a larger surface albedo feedback at both poles, combined with less-negative cloud feedbacks in the Arctic and increased poleward moisture transport in the Antarctic. However, normalizing by the global-mean surface warming yields a similar degree of Arctic amplification and only slightly increased Antarctic amplification in CMIP6 compared to CMIP5.},

  abstract = {Abstract Arctic surface warming under greenhouse gas forcing peaks in winter and reaches its minimum during summer in both observations and model projections. Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain this seasonal asymmetry, but disentangling these processes remains a challenge in the interpretation of general circulation model (GCM) experiments. To isolate these mechanisms, we use an idealized single-column sea ice model (SCM) that captures the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming. SCM experiments demonstrate that as sea ice melts and exposes open ocean, the accompanying increase in effective surface heat capacity alone can produce the observed pattern of peak warming in early winter (shifting to late winter under increased forcing) by slowing the seasonal heating rate, thus delaying the phase and reducing the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of surface temperature. To investigate warming seasonality in more complex models, we perform GCM experiments that individually isolate sea ice albedo and thermodynamic effects under CO2 forcing. These also show a key role for the effective heat capacity of sea ice in promoting seasonal asymmetry through suppressing summer warming, in addition to precluding summer climatological inversions and a positive summer lapse-rate feedback. Peak winter warming in GCM experiments is further supported by a positive winter lapse-rate feedback, due to cold initial surface temperatures and strong surface-trapped warming that are enabled by the albedo effects of sea ice alone. While many factors contribute to the seasonal pattern of Arctic warming, these results highlight changes in effective surface heat capacity as a central mechanism supporting this seasonality. Significance Statement Under increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the strongest Arctic warming has occurred during early winter, but the reasons for this seasonal pattern of warming are not well understood. We use experiments in both simple and complex models with certain sea ice processes turned on and off to disentangle potential drivers of seasonality in Arctic warming. When sea ice melts and open ocean is exposed, surface temperatures are slower to reach the warm-season maximum and slower to cool back down below freezing in early winter. We find that this process alone can produce the observed pattern of maximum Arctic warming in early winter, highlighting a fundamental mechanism for the seasonality of Arctic warming.},

  abstract = {Abstract A hierarchy of hydrodynamical instabilities controlling the transfer of buoyancy through the oceanic mixed layer is reviewed. If a resting ocean of horizontally uniform stratification is subject to spatially uniform buoyancy loss at the sea surface, then gravitational instability ensues in which buoyancy is drawn from depth by upright convection. But if spatial inhomogeneities in the ambient stratification or the forcing are present (as always exist in nature), then horizontal density gradients will be induced and, within a rotation period, horizontal currents in thermal-wind balance with those gradients will be set up within the mixed layer. There are two important consequences on the convective process: Upright convection will become modified by the presence of the thermal wind shear; fluid parcels are exchanged not along vertical paths but, rather, along slanting paths in symmetric instability. Theoretical considerations suggest that this slantwise convection sets the potential vorticity of the mixed layer fluid to zero but, in general, will leave it stably stratified in the vertical. The convective process ultimately gives way to a baroclinic instability of the horizontal mixed layer density gradients. The resulting baroclinic waves are important agents of buoyancy transport through the mixed layer and can be so efficient that the convective process all but ceases. The authors illustrate and quantify these ideas by numerical experiment with a highly resolved nonhydrostatic Navier\textendash Stokes model. Uniform spatial cooling at the surface of a resting, stratified fluid in a 2{$\frac{1}{2}$}-dimensional model on an f plane, in which zonal strips of fluid conserve their absolute momentum, causes energetic vertical overturning. A well-mixed boundary layer develops over a depth that is accurately predicted by a simple 1D law. In contrast, differential surface cooling induces a mixed layer front. Fluid parcels, made dense at the surface, sink along slanting trajectories in intense nonhydrostatic plumes. After cooling ceases the Ertel potential vorticity within the convective layer is indeed found to be vanishingly small, corresponding to convective neutrality measured in the absolute momentum surfaces that are tilted from the vertical by the horizontal vorticity of the thermal wind. In analogous fully three-dimensional calculations, the absolute momentum constraint is broken, and the convection at first coexists with, but is ultimately dominated by, a baroclinic instability of the mixed layer. For typical mixed layer depths of 500 m stability analysis predicts, and our explicit calculations confirm, that baroclinic waves with length scales O(5 km) develop with timescales of a day or so. By diagnosis of fully developed mixed layer turbulence, the authors assess the importance of the baroclinic eddy field as an agency of lateral and vertical buoyancy flux through the layer. A novel scaling for the lateral buoyancy flux due to the baroclinic eddies is suggested. These ideas are based on analysis of several experiments in which the initial stratification, rotation rate, and buoyancy forcing are varied, and the results are compared to previous attempts to parameterize the effects of baroclinic instability. There is a marked difference between the scaling that accounts for the resolved experiments and the Fickian schemes used traditionally in large-scale ocean models. Finally, consideration of the results in light of high-resolution mixed layer hydrographic surveys in the northeast Atlantic suggests mixed layer baroclinic instability may be very important at fronts. The authors speculate that the process exerts a large influence on the character of newly subducted thermocline water throughout the extratropical ocean.},

Line-by-line radiative transfer models are the most accurate means of carrying out such calculations and provide the basis for all other radiative transfer approaches. We examine the sensitivity of line-by-line results to three parameterizations of line and continuum absorption by CO2, all of which yield essentially identical radiation fluxes at low CO2 abundance. However, when applied to atmospheres containing 0.1\textendash 5 bars of CO2, appropriate for early Earth and Mars, the outgoing longwave radiation calculated with the three parameterizations differs by as much as 40 W m-2. In addition, the choice of parameters for CO2 absorption affects the sensitivity of the calculations to infrared absorption by trace gases other than CO2. Our findings imply that previous estimates of the amount of CO2 required to maintain relatively warm temperatures throughout Earth's early history and during episodes in the early history of Mars are highly uncertain. Despite these uncertainties, we conclude that early Mars probably required other infrared absorbers to reach super-freezing surface temperatures, while for the early Earth, this is not necessarily the case.},

The phase curve has a high amplitude and peak offset, suggesting that it has a significant eastward hot-spot shift as well as a large day\textendash night temperature contrast. We use a general circulation model to model potential climates, and investigate the relation between bulk atmospheric composition and the magnitude of these seemingly contradictory features. We confirm theoretical models of tidally locked circulation are consistent with our numerical model of 55 Cnc e, and rule out certain atmospheric compositions based on their thermodynamic properties. Our best-fitting atmosphere has a significant hot-spot shift and day\textendash night contrast, although these are not as large as the observed phase curve. We discuss possible physical processes that could explain the observations, and show that night-side cloud formation from species such as SiO from a day-side magma ocean could potentially increase the phase curve amplitude and explain the observations. We conclude that the observations could be explained by an optically thick atmosphere with a low mean molecular weight, a surface pressure of several bars, and a strong eastward circulation, with night-side cloud formation a possible explanation for the difference between our model and the observations.},

We linearize the shallow-water model about this eastward flow and its associated height perturbation. The forced solutions of this system show that the shear flow explains the form of the global circulation, particularly the hotspot shift and the positions of the cold standing waves on the nightside. We suggest that the eastward hotspot shift seen in observations and 3D simulations of these atmospheres is caused by the zonal flow Doppler shifting the stationary wave response eastwards, summed with the height perturbation from the flow itself. This differs from other studies that explained the hotspot shift as pure advection of heat from air flowing eastwards from the substellar point, or as equatorial waves traveling eastwards. We compare our solutions to simulations in our climate model Exo-FMS, and show that the height fields and wind patterns match. We discuss how planetary properties affect the global circulation, and how they change observables such as the hotspot shift or day\textendash night contrast.

  abstract = {In this study, the phase-locking of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a coupled model with different physical parameter values is investigated. It is found that there is a dramatic change in ENSO phase-locking in response to a slight change in the Tokioka parameter, which is a minimum entrainment rate threshold in the cumulus parameterization. With a smaller Tokioka parameter, the model simulates ENSO peak in the boreal summer season rather than in the winter season as observed. It is revealed that the differences in climatological zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient and its associated mean state changes are crucial to determine the phase-locking of ENSO. In the simulations with smaller Tokioka parameter values, climatological zonal SST gradient during the boreal summer is excessively large, because the zonally-asymmetric SST change (i.e., SST increase is relatively smaller over the eastern Pacific) is maximum during the boreal summer when the eastern Pacific SST is the coolest of the year. The enhanced climatological zonal SST gradient in boreal summer reduces the convection over the eastern Pacific, which leads to a weakening of air\textendash sea coupling strength. The minimum coupling strength during summer prevents SST anomalies from further development in the following season, which favors SST maximum during summer. In addition, enhanced zonal SST gradient and resultant thermocline shoaling over the eastern Pacific lead to excessive zonal advective feedback and thermocline feedback. Atmospheric damping is also weakened during boreal summer season. These changes due to feedback processes allow an excessive development of SST anomalies during the summer time, and lead to a summer peak of ENSO. The importance of basic state change for the ENSO phase-locking is also validated in a multi-model framework using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-3 archive. It is found that several of the climate models have the same problem in producing a summer peak of ENSO. Consistent with the simulations with different physical parameter values, these models have minimum air\textendash sea coupling strength during the boreal summer season. Also, they have stronger climatological zonal SST gradient and shallower climatological thermocline depth over the eastern Pacific during the boreal summer season.},

Previous studies have proposed various mechanisms to explain modeled abrupt winter sea-ice loss, such as the existence of a wintertime convective cloud feedback or the role of the freezing point as a natural threshold, but none have sought to explain the variability of the abruptness of winter sea-ice loss across GCMs. Here we propose a year-to-year local positive feedback cycle, in which warm, open oceans at the start of winter allow for the moistening and warming of the lower atmosphere, which in turn increases the downwards clear-sky longwave radiation at the surface and suppresses ocean freezing. This leads to delayed and diminished winter sea-ice growth, and allows for increased shortwave absorption due to lowered surface albedo during springtime. Finally, the ocean stores this additional heat throughout the summer and fall seasons, setting up even warmer ocean conditions that lead to further sea-ice reduction. We show that the strength of this feedback, as measured by the partial temperature contributions of the different surface heat fluxes, correlates strongly with the abruptness of winter sea-ice loss across models. Thus, we suggest that this feedback mechanism may explain inter-model spread in the abruptness of winter sea-ice loss. In models where the feedback mechanism is strong, this may indicate the possibility of hysteresis and thus irreversibility of sea-ice loss.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {We study climate sensitivity and feedback processes in three independent ways: (1) by using a three dimensional (3-D) global climate model for experiments in which solar irradiance S0 is increased 2 percent or CO2 is doubled, (2) by using the CLIMAP climate boundary conditions to analyze the contributions of different physical processes to the cooling of the last ice age (18K years ago), and (3) by using estimated changes in global temperature and the abundance of atmospheric greenhouse gases to deduce an empirical climate sensitivity for the period 1850\textendash 1980. Our 3-D global climate model yields a warming of {$\sim$}4\textdegree C for either a 2 percent increase of S0 or doubled CO2. This indicates a net feedback factor of f = 3\textendash 4, because either of these forcings would cause the earth's surface temperature to warm 1.2\textendash 1.3\textdegree C to restore radiative balance with space, if other factors remained unchanged. Principal positive feedback processes in the model are changes in atmospheric water vapor, clouds and snow/ice cover. Feedback factors calculated for these processes, with atmospheric dynamical feedbacks implicitly incorporated, are respectively fwater vapor {$\sim$} 1.6, fclouds {$\sim$} 1.3 and fsnow/ice {$\sim$} 1.1 with the latter mainly caused by sea ice changes. A number of potential feedbacks, such as land ice cover, vegetation cover and ocean heat transport were held fixed in these experiments. We calculate land ice, sea ice and vegetation feedbacks for the 18K climate to be fland ice {$\sim$} 1.2\textendash 1.3, fsea ice {$\sim$} 1.2 and fvegetation {$\sim$} 1.05\textendash 1.1 from their effect on the radiation budget at the top of the atmosphere. This sea ice feedback at 18K is consistent with the smaller fsnow/ice {$\sim$} 1.1 in the S0 and CO2 experiments, which applied to a warmer earth with less sea ice. We also obtain an empirical estimate of f = 2\textendash 4 for the fast feedback processes (water vapor, clouds, sea ice) operating on 10\textendash 100 year time scales by comparing the cooling due to slow or specified changes (land ice, C02, vegetation) to the total cooling at 18K. The temperature increase believed to have occurred in the past 130 years (approximately 0.5\textdegree C) is also found to imply a climate sensitivity of 2.5\textendash 5\textdegree C for doubled C02 (f = 2\textendash 4), if (1) the temperature increase is due to the added greenhouse gases, (2) the 1850 CO2 abundance was 270{$\pm$}10 ppm, and (3) the heat perturbation is mixed like a passive tracer in the ocean with vertical mixing coefficient k {$\sim$} 1 cm2 s-1. These analyses indicate that f is substantially greater than unity on all time scales. Our best estimate for the current climate due to processes operating on the 10\textendash 100 year time scale is f = 2\textendash 4, corresponding to a climate sensitivity of 2.5\textendash 5\textdegree C for doubled CO2. The physical process contributing the greatest uncertainty to f on this time scale appears to be the cloud feedback. We show that the ocean's thermal relaxation time depends strongly on f. The e-folding time constant for response of the isolated ocean mixed layer is about 15 years, for the estimated value of f. This time is sufficiently long to allow substantial heat exchange between the mixed layer and deeper layers. For f = 3\textendash 4 the response time of the surface temperature to a heating perturbation is of order 100 years, if the perturbation is sufficiently small that it does not alter the rate of heat exchange with the deeper ocean. The climate sensitivity we have inferred is larger than that stated in the Carbon Dioxide Assessment Committee report (CDAC, 1983). Their result is based on the empirical temperature increase in the past 130 years, but their analysis did not account for the dependence of the ocean response time on climate sensitivity. Their choice of a fixed 15 year response time biased their result to low sensitivities. We infer that, because of recent increases in atmospheric CO2 and trace gases, there is a large, rapidly growing gap between current climate and the equilibrium climate for current atmospheric composition. Based on the climate sensitivity we have estimated, the amount of greenhouse gases presently in the atmosphere will cause an eventual global mean warming of about 1\textdegree C, making the global temperature at least comparable to that of the Altithermal, the warmest period in the past 100,000 years. Projection of future climate trends on the 10\textendash 100 year time scale depends crucially upon improved understanding of ocean dynamics, particularly upon how ocean mixing will respond to climate change at the ocean surface.},

Aerosol climate forcing today is inferred to be -1.6 {$\pm$} 0.3 W m\textsuperscript{-2}, implying substantial aerosol indirect climate forcing via cloud changes. Continued failure to quantify the specific origins of this large forcing is untenable, as knowledge of changing aerosol effects is needed to understand future climate change. We conclude that recent slowdown of ocean heat uptake was caused by a delayed rebound effect from Mount Pinatubo aerosols and a deep prolonged solar minimum.

The Atlantic block was forced by the nonlinear interaction of intense baroclinic cyclone-scale waves with barotropic, ultralong waves. The Pacific blocking resulted from the baroclinic amplification of planetary-scale waves. In addition, at least two necessary conditions are required for the development of blocking. First, one of the forcing mechanisms must be in operation, and second, the phase of the antecedent planetary-scale waves must be such that the forcing mechanism can amplify them into a blocking pattern.

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) and European Space Agency Swarm satellites were well placed to observe its impact on the ionospheric wind dynamo. After the Lamb wave entered the dayside, Swarm A observed an eastward and then westward equatorial electrojet (EEJ) on two consecutive orbits, each with magnitudes exceeding the 99.9th percentile of typically observed values. ICON simultaneously observed the neutral wind (90\textendash 300 km altitude) at approximately the same distance from Tonga. The observed neutral winds were also extreme ({$>$}99.9th percentile at some altitudes). The covariation of EEJ and winds is consistent with recent theoretical and observational results, indicating that the westward electrojet is driven by strong westward winds in the Pedersen region ({$\sim$}120\textendash 150 km). These observations imply that the dynamo is a key mechanism in the ionospheric response to the Tonga disturbance.},

  abstract = {The effect of cloud-radiation interactions on cloud properties is examined in the context of a limited-domain cloud-resolving model. The atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) influences the areal extent of tropical high clouds in two distinct ways. The first is through direct radiative destabilization of the elevated cloud layers, mostly as a result of longwave radiation heating the cloud bottom and cooling the cloud top. The second effect is radiative stabilization, whereby cloud radiative heating of the atmospheric column stabilizes the atmosphere to deep convection. In limited area domain simulations, the stabilizing (or indirect) effect is the dominant role of the cloud radiative heating, thus reducing the cloud cover in simulations where ACRE is included compared to those where it is removed. Direct cloud radiative heating increases high cloud fraction, decreases mean cloud optical depth, and increases cloud top temperature. The indirect cloud radiative heating decreases high cloud fraction, but also decreases mean cloud optical depth and increases cloud top temperature. The combination of these effects increases the top-of-atmosphere cloud radiative effect. In mock-Walker circulation experiments, the decrease in high cloud amount owing to radiative stabilization tends to cancel out the increase in high cloud amount owing to the destabilization within the cloud layer. The changes in cloud optical depth and cloud top pressure, however, are similar to those produced in the limited area domain simulations.},

The trend in Arctic ice is clearly evident in the time series of reflected shortwave radiation, which closely follows the record of ice extent. The data indicate that, for every 10\textsuperscript{6} km\textsuperscript{2} decrease in September sea ice extent, annual-mean absorbed solar radiation averaged over 75\textdegree\textendash 90\textdegree N increases by 2.5 W m\textsuperscript{-2}, or about 6 W m\textsuperscript{-2} between 2000 and 2012. CMIP5 models generally show a much smaller change in sea ice extent over the 1970\textendash 2012 period, but the relationship of sea ice extent to reflected shortwave is in good agreement with recent observations. Another robust trend during this period is an increase in reflected shortwave radiation in the zonal belt from 45\textdegree{} to 65\textdegree S. This trend is mostly related to increases in sea ice concentrations in the Southern Ocean and less directly related to cloudiness trends associated with the annular variability of the Southern Hemisphere. Models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) produce a scaling of cloud reflection to zonal wind increase that is similar to trend observations in regions separated from the direct effects of sea ice. Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) model responses over the Southern Ocean are not consistent with each other or with the observed shortwave trends in regions removed from the direct effect of sea ice.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This rapid decline of clear-sky longwave cooling occurs because radiative emission from water vapor becomes inefficient above 200 hPa. The emission from water vapor becomes less important than the emission from CO2 because the saturation vapor pressure is so very low at the temperatures above 200 hPa. This suggests that the temperature at the detrainment level, and consequently the emission temperature of tropical anvil clouds, will remain constant during climate change. This constraint has very important implications for the potential role of tropical convective clouds in climate feedback, since it means that the emission temperatures of tropical anvil clouds and upper tropospheric water vapor are essentially independent of the surface temperature, so long as the tropopause is colder than the temperature where emission from water vapor becomes relatively small.},

Using well-controlled modeling experiments, we show that blocking variations associated with mean state anomalies are opposite depending on whether these anomalies are driven by the internal dynamics as in AO or forced externally as in Arctic amplification. While blocking increases and its latitudinal-distribution shifts poleward in -AO, we find opposite responses when a mean state identical to the -AO mean state is externally forced. Findings suggest that the observed blocking-AO relationship is a correlation which does not imply that the -AO mean state causes increased blocking and should not be employed as a prototype for Arctic amplification. Furthermore, results urge for a careful consideration of causality before using internal variability to predict low-frequency response to external forcings.},

Decreasing {$\Delta$}T results in slower zonal winds, a mean state with reduced meridional gradient of the 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), a smaller variance of Z500 anomalies, and a robust decrease in blocks and meridional amplitude of waves. Neglecting the decrease of variance associated with reduced {$\Delta$}T would lead to the incorrect expectation that mean states with smaller Z500 gradients produce more blocks and higher wave amplitudes. Our results suggest further investigation of the hypothesis that reduced {$\Delta$}T due to Arctic Amplification would increase blocking events and wave amplitude, hence leading to more midlatitude extreme weather events.},

Published studies offer two explanations: (i) evolving patterns of ocean heat uptake (OHU) or radiative forcing give rise to OHU or forcing ``efficacies'' and (ii) evolving patterns of surface temperature change. This study seeks to determine whether these explanations are indeed distinct. Using an idealized framework of an aquaplanet atmosphere-only model, we show that radiative feedbacks depend on the pattern of climate forcing. Yet the same feedbacks arise when the temperature pattern induced by that climate forcing is prescribed in the absence of any forcing. These findings suggest the perspective that feedbacks are influenced by efficacies of forcing and OHU is equivalent to the perspective that feedbacks are dependent on the temperature patterns induced by those forcings. Prescribed surface temperature simulations are thus valuable for studying the temporal evolution of radiative feedbacks.},

The sea ice loss and radiative forcing protocols differ between the sets of experiments. This response is compared to the remaining climate change signal, which is dominated by low-latitude warming. Some aspects of the wintertime circulation response to sea ice loss are remarkably robust: warming over much of the high latitude and midlatitude; weak cooling over eastern Eurasia, strengthening of the Aleutian Low and Siberian High, equatorward intensification of the lower tropospheric winds, and increased precipitation over high latitudes. Pattern scaling separates the parts of the response that scale with low-latitude warming and with sea ice loss. The thermal response patterns, for both sea ice loss and low-latitude warming, are similar between the models. However, the circulation response patterns that scale with low-latitude warming differ between the models. Preliminary evidence shows that these conclusions apply to other models driven by distinctive sea ice loss protocols.},

In spite of some differences in experimental design, the Northern Hemisphere near-surface atmospheric sensitivity to sea-ice loss is found to be robust across models in the cold season; however, a larger inter-model spread is found at the surface in boreal summer, and in the free tropospheric circulation. In contrast, the sensitivity to low-latitude warming is most robust in the free troposphere and in the warm season, with more inter-model spread in the surface ocean and surface heat flux over the Northern Hemisphere. The robust signals associated with sea-ice loss include upward turbulent and longwave heat fluxes where sea-ice is lost, warming and freshening of the Arctic ocean, warming of the eastern North Pacific relative to the western North Pacific with upward turbulent heat fluxes in the Kuroshio extension, and salinification of the shallow shelf seas of the Arctic Ocean alongside freshening in the subpolar North Atlantic. In contrast, the robust signals associated with low-latitude warming include intensified ocean warming and upward latent heat fluxes near the western boundary currents, freshening of the Pacific Ocean, salinification of the North Atlantic, and downward sensible and longwave fluxes over the ocean.},

Numerous regional episodes of increased atmospheric temperature and moisture, transported from lower latitudes, increased the cumulative energy input from downwelling longwave surface fluxes.

They can also be destabilized by damping of potential vorticity if this damping is larger in the lower than in the upper troposphere. Results are described in detail for Charney's model. Implications for the effects of diabatic heating and mixing due to smaller scale transients on equivalent barotropic stationary or quasi-stationary long waves are discussed. It is painted out that energy or potential enstrophy budgets may indicate that transients are damping the long waves while, in fact, their presence is destabilizing these waves.},

Analyses of observations and general circulation models are evolving rapidly and complementing each other as they focus on the most dynamically interesting budgets and statistics. In the case of solid body rotation, the eddy activity spreads more or less uniformly over the sphere. The mean flow is accelerated in the region in which the initial wave activity is large, while the compensating deceleration determined by the dissipation of wave activity occurs over a wide range of latitudes. The natural procedure for constructing the analogous neutralized state in a continuously stratified atmosphere is to satisfy the Charney-Stern criterion by destroying the temperature gradient at the surface and by destroying the potential vorticity gradient in a layer adjacent to the surface. Upstream of the vorticity centers the low-level equatorward flow of cold continental air and the poleward flow of moist subtropical air have a frontogenetic effect, increasing the low-level baroclinicity in the storm track. It is suggested that the developing cross-fertilization among theory, numerical general circulation modeling, and observational studies will result in rapid advances in understanding of the large-scale flow in the atmosphere.},

A qualitative discussion of the gross stability of each medium suggests that the resulting ratio of oceanic to atmospheric energy transport, averaged over the Hadley cell, is roughly equal to the ratio of the heat capacity of water to that of air at constant pressure, multiplied by the ratio of the moist- to the dry-adiabatic lapse rates near the surface.

Eddy statistics obtained from the model are interpreted in terms of linear theory and a modified ``baroclinic adjustment'' hypothesis. Both linear theory and the baroclinic adjustment construction are found to provide useful predictions for the vertical structure of the eddy potential vorticity flux.For equal values of the mean vertical shear, eddy fluxes and energies are greater when the shear is concentrated at lower levels (d2U/dz2 {$<$} 0) than when the shear is concentrated at higher levels (d2U/dz2 {$>$} 0). Eddy fluxes are more sensitive to lower-than to upper-level mean temperature gradients. This relative sensitivity is a function of {$\gamma$} = f2{$\Lambda$}/({$\beta$}N2H), where {$\Lambda$} is the mean vertical shear and His the depth of the fluid. It is enhanced as {$\gamma$} is reduced, as the unstable modes become shallower, until the eddies become almost completely insensitive to the strength of the upper-layer wind for {$\gamma$} {$<$} 0.5.},

The domain is periodic in x, with a width of 640 km, and extends from the ground to 26 km. The lower boundary is a fixed-temperature water-saturated surface. The model produces a temperature profile resembling the mean profile observed in the tropics. A number of integrations of several months' duration are described in this preliminary examination of the model's qualitative behavior. The model generates a QBO-like oscillation in the x-averaged winds with an apparent period of {$\sim$}60 days. This oscillation extends into the troposphere and influences the convective organization. In order to avoid the associated large vertical wind shears, calculations are also performed in which the x-averaged winds are constrained to vanish. The convection then evolves into a pattern in which rain falls only within a small part of the domain. The moisture field appears to provide the memory that localizes the convection. If the vertical shears are fixed at a modest nonzero value, this localization is avoided. Comparing calculations with surface temperatures of 25\textdegree{} and 30\textdegree C, the planetary albedo is found to decrease with increasing temperature, primarily due to a reduction in low-level cloudiness.},

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

The seasonal variation in incident solar radiation is ignored. Emphasis is placed on the parameter dependence of the models' sensitivity to changes in the solar constant. It is found in all cases that increasing the efficiency of the poleward transport of energy increases this sensitivity. It is also suggested that knowledge of the partitioning of the transport between the atmosphere and the oceans is of considerable importance for estimating sensitivity. The stability of equilibrium states is determined from the properties of small perturbations away from equilibrium. It is observed that relaxation times of perturbations can be increased considerably by the albedo feedback mechanism. The effect of variations in the obliquity of the planet's orbit on sensitivity and stability is also analyzed.

There is typically only one stationary vertical mode, the external mode, trapped within the troposphere. For more than one tropospheric mode to exist, we find that vertical shears must be smaller than those usually observed in extratropical latitudes. The vertical structure, horizontal wavenumber and group velocity of the external mode, and the projection onto this mode of topographic and thermal forcing are studied with continuous models (a linear shear profile as well as more realistic basic states), and a finite-differenced model with resolution and upper boundary condition similar to that used in GCMs. We point out that the rigid-lid upper boundary condition need not create artificial stationary resonances, as the artificial stationary vertical modes that are created are often horizontally evanescent. The results are presented in a form which allows one to design the equivalent barotropic model that captures the external mode's contribution to the stationary wave field. It is found, in particular, that the wind blowing over the topography in such a barotropic model should generally be larger than the surface wind but smaller than the wind at the equivalent barotropic level. Also, the group velocity of the stationary external mode in realistic vertical shear is found to be considerably greater than that of the stationary Rossby wave in the equivalent barotropic model.},

It is then argued that cold air advection by the residual circulation is responsible for the formation of surface inversions at all latitudes in idealized GCMs with weak thermal damping.

There is a formal resemblance to two-dimensional flow, with surface temperature playing the role of vorticity, but a different relationship between the flow and the advected scalar creates several distinctive features. A series of examples are described which highlight some of these features: the evolution of an elliptical vortex; the start-up vortex shed by flow over a mountain; the instability of temperature filaments; the `edge wave' critical layer; and mixing in an overturning edge wave. Characteristics of the direct cascade of the tracer variance to small scales in homogeneous turbulence, as well as the inverse energy cascade, are also described. In addition to its geophysical relevance, the ubiquitous generation of secondary instabilities and the possibility of finite-time collapse make this system a potentially important, numerically tractable, testbed for turbulence theories.},

Despite being simply a regrouping of terms in the feedback analysis, this alternative perspective has the benefit of removing most of the pervasive cancellation between water and lapse-rate feedbacks seen in models. As a consequence, the individual feedbacks have less scatter than in the traditional formulation. The role of cloud feedbacks in controlling climate sensitivity is also reflected more clearly in the new formulation.},

Previous attribution methods compute the vertically uniform temperature change required to balance the top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance caused by each forcing and feedback, with any departures from vertically uniform warming collected into the lapse-rate feedback. We propose an alternative attribution method using a single-column model that accounts for the forcing dependence of high-latitude lapse-rate changes. We examine this method in an idealized general circulation model (GCM), finding that, even though the column-integrated carbon dioxide (CO2) forcing and water vapor feedback are stronger in the tropics, they contribute to polar-amplified surface warming as they produce bottom-heavy warming in high latitudes. A separation of atmospheric temperature changes into local and remote contributors shows that, in the absence of polar surface forcing (e.g., sea ice retreat), changes in energy transport are primarily responsible for the polar-amplified pattern of warming. The addition of surface forcing substantially increases polar surface warming and reduces the contribution of atmospheric dry static energy transport to the warming. This physically based attribution method can be applied to comprehensive GCMs to provide a clearer view of the mechanisms behind Arctic amplification.},

Here we show that the difference in vertical structure of temperature change between increasing CO2, decreasing insolation, and decreasing atmospheric energy transport is the dominant reason for the residual near-surface warming at high latitudes. A single-column model (SCM) is used to decompose the high-latitude temperature change and shows the importance of the enhanced near-surface warming from the CO2 increase in explaining the residual polar warming. This suite of models invites caution when attributing high-latitude surface temperature changes to the lapse rate feedback, as various forcings and nonlocal processes affect the vertical structure of temperature change differently.},

Previous work has attributed this reduced Arctic land seasonality to the effects of sea ice or clouds. In this paper, we show that the reduced Arctic land seasonality is a robust consequence of the relatively small surface heat capacity of land and the nonlinearity of the temperature dependence of surface longwave emission, without recourse to other processes or feedbacks. We use a General Circulation Model (GCM) with no clouds or sea ice and a simple representation of land. In the annual mean, the equator-to-pole surface temperature gradient falls with increasing CO\textsubscript{2}, but this is only a near-surface phenomenon and is not caused by the change in total meridional heat transport, which is virtually unaltered. The high-latitude land has about twice as much warming in winter than in summer, whereas high-latitude ocean has very little seasonality in warming. A surface energy balance model shows how the combination of the smaller surface heat capacity of land and the nonlinearity of the temperature dependence of surface longwave emission gives rise to the reduced seasonality of the land surface. The increase in evaporation over land also leads to winter amplification of warming over land, although amplification still occurs without it. While changes in clouds, sea ice, and ocean heat transport undoubtedly play a role in high-latitude warming, these results show that enhanced land surface temperature warming in winter can happen in their absence for robust reasons.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The hypothesis we test is whether the circulations associated with cyclones and ARs may routinely lead to the presence of unusually warm, moist air masses over ice-covered regions. The analysis is conducted over the extended Austral winter seasons (May-September) between May 1979 and September 2012, based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis data. Approximately 27\% of intense Southern Ocean cyclones and 20\% of ARs occur in the vicinity of extreme temperature anomalies, while 12\% of intense cyclones and 46\% of ARs occur in the vicinity of extreme moisture anomalies. We summarize our results as follows: (a) extreme atmospheric anomalies over sea ice often occur in the absence of cyclones or ARs; (b) intense cyclones have a stronger association with extreme temperature anomalies than ARs; (c) approximately half of the ARs are in the vicinity of extreme moisture anomalies, while the latter's link with cyclones is weak; and (d) if an AR is in the vicinity of an extreme temperature anomaly, there will likely be a concurrent extreme moisture anomaly. This points to a strong association between ARs and moisture extremes, and a nuanced link between Southern Ocean polar cyclones and atmospheric anomalies over Antarctic sea ice.},

This paper is an analysis of the hemispheric radiation fields obtained with Eppley pyranometers and silicon flux detectors, and the cloud microphysical data obtained with the Knollenberg FSSP and 200X probes. These data were collected in a series of 12 vertical profiles in a variety of boundary layer stratus and altostratus situations. The results are interpreted with the aid of a theoretical radiative transfer model developed by Slingo and Schrecker. The Knollenberg measurements indicated a wide range of cloud liquid water contents which generally increased from cloud base to cloud top. Values of the equivalent radius of the droplet size distribution are presented. Based on the agreement between the radiation measurements and the model calculations, it is concluded that the Knollenberg FSSP probe produced realistic liquid water concentrations in the present study. Cloud reflectivity, transmissivity, and absorptivity were obtained with the Eppley pyranometers over the total solar spectrum, and also in the visible and near infrared regions, while the silicon detector produced values over the total spectrum, and in the near-infrared. The reflectivity and transmissivity obtained with the two systems agreed well with each other, and also with the model calculations. The measured values of absorptivity were systematically greater than those predicted, particularly in the visible region. The theoretical model was used to investigate in each cloud profile the roles of aerosols, gaseous and droplet absorptions, and surface reflectivity. In particular, it was found that Arctic summer aerosol did not significantly affect the bulk radiative properties of the clouds, but did have a large effect on the ratio of diffuse to total radiation above the cloud.}

Horizontal spectral resolution is T159 (about 125 km), using 91 levels in the vertical from the surface up to 1 Pa, and a time step of 1 h. This ensemble, denoted by ERA-20CM, formed the first step toward a twentieth-century reanalysis within ERA-CLIM, a three-year European funded project involving nine partners. Sea-surface temperature and sea-ice cover are prescribed by an ensemble of realizations (HadISST2), as recently produced by the Met Office Hadley Centre within ERA-CLIM. Variation in these realizations reflect uncertainties in the available observational sources on which this product is based. Forcing terms in the model radiation scheme follow CMIP5 recommendations. Any effect of their uncertainty is neglected. These terms include solar forcing, greenhouse gases, ozone and aerosols. Both the ocean surface and radiative forcing incorporate a proper long-term evolution of climate trends in the twentieth century, and the occurrence of major events, such as the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillations and volcanic eruptions. No atmospheric observations were assimilated. For this reason ERA-20CM is not able to reproduce actual synoptic situations. However, the ensemble is able to provide a statistical estimate of the climate. Overall, the temperature rise over land is in fair agreement with the CRUTEM4 observational product. Over the last two decades the warming over land exceeds the warming over sea, which is consistent with models participating in the CMIP5 project, as well as with the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis. Some aspects of warming and of the hydrological cycle are discerned, and the model response to volcanic eruptions is qualitatively correct. The data from ERA-20CM are freely available, embracing monthly-mean fields for many atmospheric and ocean-wave quantities, and synoptic fields for a small, essential subset.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

  abstract = {Observational and modelling evidence suggest that poleward ocean heat transport (OHT) can vary in response to both natural climate variability and greenhouse warming. Recent modelling studies have shown that increased OHT warms both the tropical and global mean climates. Using two different coupled climate models with mixed-layer oceans, with and without OHT, along with a coupled model with a fixed-current ocean component in which the currents are uniformly reduced and increased by 50\%, an attempt is made to explain why this may happen.OHT warms the global mean climate by 1 to 1.6K in the atmospheric general circulation (AGCM) ML model and 3.5K in the AGCM fixed current model. In each model the warming is attributed to an increase in atmospheric greenhouse trapping, primarily clear-sky greenhouse trapping, and a reduction in albedo. This occurs as OHT moistens the atmosphere, particularly at subtropical latitudes. This is not purely a thermodynamic response to the reduction in planetary albedo at these latitudes. It is a change in atmospheric circulation that both redistributes the water vapour and allows for a global atmospheric moistening\textemdash a positive `dynamical' water vapour feedback. With increasing OHT the atmospheric water vapour content increases as atmospheric convection spreads out of the deep tropics. The global mean planetary albedo is decreased with increasedOHT. This change is explained by a decrease in subtropical and mid-latitude low cloudiness, along with a reduction in high-latitude surface albedo due to decreased sea ice. The climate models with the mixed layer oceans underestimate both the subtropical low cloud cover and the high-latitude sea ice/surface albedo, and consequently have a smaller warming response to OHT.},

This model is used to investigate the effects of ice dynamics on Arctic ice thickness and air-sea heat flux characteristics by carrying out several numerical simulations over the entire Arctic Ocean region. The essential idea in the model is to couple the dynamics to the ice thickness characteristics by allowing the ice interaction to become stronger as the ice becomes thicker and/or contains a lower areas percentage of thin ice. The dynamics in turn causes high oceanic heat losses in regions of ice divergence and reduced heat losses in regions of convergence. TO model these effects consistently the ice is considered to interact in a plastic manner with the plastic strength chosen to depend on the ice thickness and concentration. The thickness and concentration, in turn, evolve according to continuity equations which include changes in ice mass and percent of open water due to advection, ice deformation and thermodynamic effects.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}For the standard experiment an integration of eight years in length is performed at one day timesteps and 125 km resolution in order to obtain a cyclic equilibrium. A zero ice strength condition is used at the Greenland-Spitsbergen passage to allow natural outflow or inflow. Several other shorter experiments, including a case without open water effects, are also run for comparison. Input fields consist of observed time varying geostrophic winds over a one year period, fixed geostrophic ocean currents, and geographically invariant ice growth rates dependent on ice thickness and season.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Many of the observed features of the circulation and thickness of the Arctic ice cover are reproduced by the model. The average annual drift shows the classic anticyclonic ice flow in the Beaufort Sea together with a transpolar drift of ice from the Siberian coast toward the Greenland Sea. In addition, the nonlinear plastic rheology allows the formation of a shear zone (velocity discontinuity) from time to time off the North Slope of Alaska. The average rate of ice export out of the basin is {$\sim$}0.1 Sv in reasonable agreement with observational estimates. Geographical ice thickness contours show ice in excess of 6 m along the Canadian Archipelago with thicknesses decreasing to 2 m near the Siberian coast. The form of these contours is in good agreement with that estimated from submarine sonar data and aerial ridge surveys. In summer a low compactness region of up to 50\% open water builds up off the Alaskan and Siberian coasts, in general agreement with satellite-derived ice concentration charts. Further from shore, smaller, but still significant, amounts ({$\sim$}10\%) of open water also form in summer. An important, less verifiable characteristic is that the annual net ice production is dominated by the North Slope and Siberian nearshore regions where, on the average, offshore advection creates open water and thinner ice. Overall the simulation results suggest that lateral heat transport due to ice motion is of the same order of magnitude as vertical air-sea heat fluxes.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract The interpretation in terms of basic hydrodynamical Processes of certain prominent observational features exhibited by the atmospheres of major planets should lead in due course to accurate information about the internal structure of these bodies (e.g. atmospheric depth, angular momentum transfer, energy sources) that may be obtainable in no other way. Tentative information of this kind has already been found as a result of attempts to interpret 1) the Great Red Spot and other, less persistent and generally smaller, spots on Jupiter's visible surface, 2) the banded appearance, and complicated and striking variation of rotation rate with latitude, including the equatorial jets, of Jupiter and Saturn, and 3) Jupiter's magnetic field, with its characteristic rotation period. The dynamical influence of rotation on relative motions in the atmospheres of the major planets is much more pronounced than in the case of the earth's atmosphere, though effects due to vertical density stratification are probably much less important. Possible complications arise because 1) the major planets rotate hypersonically with respect to the speed of sound in their atmospheres, and 2) the electrical conductivity of the lower reaches of these atmospheres might be sufficiently large for magnetohydrodynamic processes to occur there.

Improvements in geoid and ocean circulation models, and GPS positioning of tide gauge benchmarks, provide an opportunity to produce new tilt estimates. Tilts estimated using tide gauge measurements referenced to high-resolution geoid models (the geodetic approach) and ocean circulation models (the ocean approach) are compared. The geodetic estimates are broadly similar, with tilts downward to the north through the Florida Straits and at Cape Hatteras. Estimates from the ocean approach show good agreement with the geodetic estimates, indicating a convergence of the two approaches and resolving the long standing debate as to the sign of the tilt. These tilts differ from those used by Yin and Goddard (2013) to support a link between changing ocean circulation and coastal sea level rise.},

  abstract = {Abstract Deeper theoretical understanding of Hadley circulation (HC) width and the mechanisms leading to HC expansion is gained by exploring the response of a zonally symmetric slab ocean aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) to imposed poleward ocean heat transport (OHT). Poleward OHT causes the subtropical edge of the HC to shift poleward by up to 3\textdegree{} compared to its position in simulations without OHT. This HC widening is interpreted as being driven by a decrease in baroclinicity near the poleward edge of the HC and is divided into three components: a decrease in baroclinicity due to 1) a systematic poleward shift of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during the seasonal cycle that drives a decrease in the angular momentum of the HC and, consequently, a weakening of the vertical shear of the zonal wind; 2) an increase in subtropical static stability and the vertical extent of the HC, both of which result from OHT's effect on global-mean temperature; and 3) a relaxation of the meridional sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the outer tropics and subtropics by OHT. Although the third mechanism contributes the most to the response of HC width to OHT, the contributions from the first two mechanisms each account for up to 20\%\textendash 30\% of the HC response. This work highlights the role of ITCZ position in producing HC expansion and in setting the climatological width of the HC, a role which has been underappreciated. This study indicates a fundamental role for baroclinicity in limiting the poleward extent of the HC.},

Thermal inertia\textemdash which damps and lags the ascent latitude relative to the insolation\textemdash is accounted for semi-analytically through the Mitchell et al.

Our theory, given empirically an additional \textasciitilde 1-month lag for the descending edge, captures the climatological annual cycle of the ascending and descending edges in an Earth-like simulation in an idealized aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM). In simulations in this and two other idealized GCMs with varied planetary rotation rate ({$\Omega$}), the winter, descending edge of the solsticial, cross-equatorial Hadley cell scales approximately as {$\Omega-$}1/2 and the summer, ascending edge as {$\Omega-$}2/3, both in accordance with our theory.

Both reference warmings are taken from a freely running integration of the model. One event is a displacement, the other is a split, and both are followed by extended recoveries in the lower stratosphere. The methodology permits a statistically robust study of their influence on the troposphere below. The nudged ensembles exhibit a tropospheric annular mode response closely analogous to that seen in observations, confirming the downward influence of sudden warmings on the troposphere in a comprehensive model. This tropospheric response coincides more closely with the lower-stratospheric annular mode anomalies than with the midstratospheric wind reversal. In addition to the expected synoptic-scale eddy feedback, the planetary-scale eddies also reinforce the tropospheric wind changes, apparently responding directly to the stratospheric anomalies. Furthermore, despite the zonal symmetry of the stratospheric perturbation, a highly zonally asymmetric near-surface response is produced, corresponding to a strongly negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation with a much weaker response over the Pacific basin that matches composites of sudden warmings from the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models exhibit a similar response, though in most models the response's magnitude is underrepresented.},

  abstract = {Geological evidence indicates that grounded ice sheets reached sea level at all latitudes during two long-lived Cryogenian (58 and {$\geq$}5 My) glaciations. Combined uranium-lead and rhenium-osmium dating suggests that the older (Sturtian) glacial onset and both terminations were globally synchronous. Geochemical data imply that CO2 was 102 PAL (present atmospheric level) at the younger termination, consistent with a global ice cover. Sturtian glaciation followed breakup of a tropical supercontinent, and its onset coincided with the equatorial emplacement of a large igneous province. Modeling shows that the small thermal inertia of a globally frozen surface reverses the annual mean tropical atmospheric circulation, producing an equatorial desert and net snow and frost accumulation elsewhere. Oceanic ice thickens, forming a sea glacier that flows gravitationally toward the equator, sustained by the hydrologic cycle and by basal freezing and melting. Tropical ice sheets flow faster as CO2 rises but lose mass and become sensitive to orbital changes. Equatorial dust accumulation engenders supraglacial oligotrophic meltwater ecosystems, favorable for cyanobacteria and certain eukaryotes. Meltwater flushing through cracks enables organic burial and submarine deposition of airborne volcanic ash. The subglacial ocean is turbulent and well mixed, in response to geothermal heating and heat loss through the ice cover, increasing with latitude. Terminal carbonate deposits, unique to Cryogenian glaciations, are products of intense weathering and ocean stratification. Whole-ocean warming and collapsing peripheral bulges allow marine coastal flooding to continue long after ice-sheet disappearance. The evolutionary legacy of Snowball Earth is perceptible in fossils and living organisms.

  abstract = {Abstract The Community Climate System Model, version 4 has revisions across all components. For sea ice, the most notable improvements are the incorporation of a new shortwave radiative transfer scheme and the capabilities that this enables. This scheme uses inherent optical properties to define scattering and absorption characteristics of snow, ice, and included shortwave absorbers and explicitly allows for melt ponds and aerosols. The deposition and cycling of aerosols in sea ice is now included, and a new parameterization derives ponded water from the surface meltwater flux. Taken together, this provides a more sophisticated, accurate, and complete treatment of sea ice radiative transfer. In preindustrial CO2 simulations, the radiative impact of ponds and aerosols on Arctic sea ice is 1.1 W m-2 annually, with aerosols accounting for up to 8 W m-2 of enhanced June shortwave absorption in the Barents and Kara Seas and with ponds accounting for over 10 W m-2 in shelf regions in July. In double CO2 (2XCO2) simulations with the same aerosol deposition, ponds have a larger effect, whereas aerosol effects are reduced, thereby modifying the surface albedo feedback. Although the direct forcing is modest, because aerosols and ponds influence the albedo, the response is amplified. In simulations with no ponds or aerosols in sea ice, the Arctic ice is over 1 m thicker and retains more summer ice cover. Diagnosis of a twentieth-century simulation indicates an increased radiative forcing from aerosols and melt ponds, which could play a role in twentieth-century Arctic sea ice reductions. In contrast, ponds and aerosol deposition have little effect on Antarctic sea ice for all climates considered.},

In particular, the magnitude, spatial distribution, and seasonality of the surface warming in the Arctic is examined and compared among the models. The range of simulated polar warming in the Arctic is from 1.5 to 4.5 times the global mean warming. While ice-albedo feedback is likely to account for much of the polar amplification, the strength of the feedback depends on numerous physical processes and parametrizations which differ considerably among the models. Nonetheless, the mean sea-ice state in the control (or present) climate is found to influence both the magnitude and spatial distribution of the high-latitude warming in the models. In particular, the latitude of the maximum warming is correlated inversely and significantly with sea-ice extent in the control climate. Additionally, models with relatively thin Arctic ice cover in the control climate tend to have higher polar amplification. An intercomparison of model results also shows that increases in poleward ocean heat transport at high latitudes and increases in polar cloud cover are significantly correlated to amplified Arctic warming. This suggests that these changes in the climate state may modify polar amplification. No significant correlation is found between polar amplification and the control climate continental ice and snow cover.},

During summer and fall, the Northern Hemisphere extratropical jet is relatively narrow and acts as a waveguide, such that Rossby wave trains traversing the Great Lakes region travel along the extratropical Pacific and Atlantic jets. During other months, the Pacific jet is relatively broad, which allows more wave activity originating in the tropics to penetrate into the midlatitudes and influence Lake Superior precipitation. Analysis is extended to CMIP3 models and is intended to 1) further understanding of how variations in the mean state influence transient Rossby waves and 2) assess models' ability to capture observed features, such as wave origin and track. Results indicate that Rossby wave train propagation in twentieth-century simulations can significantly differ by model. Unlike observations, some models do not produce a well-defined jet across the Pacific Ocean during summer and autumn. In these models, some Rossby waves affecting the Great Lakes region originate in the tropics. Collectively, observations and model results show the importance of the time-mean upper-level flow on Rossby wave propagation and therefore on the relative influence of the tropics versus the extratropics on the hydroclimate of the Great Lakes region.},

We investigate relationships between SIA climatology and 21st century change in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, phase 6 (CMIP6) multi-model ensemble. In summer, under a strong forcing scenario, each model loses the majority of its sea ice. Therefore, models with greater historical SIA exhibit greater reductions, so the observed climatology of SIA strongly constrains projections. Ensemble spread in historical summer SIA is smaller than in CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5), and CMIP6 gives a more robust constraint on future SIA. In winter, by 2100 under a strong forcing scenario, 40\% of SIA disappears on average, and ensemble spread in historical mean SIA explains approximately half the spread in projected change. A greater winter ice loss in CMIP6 than CMIP5 is explained by the higher climate sensitivities of some CMIP6 models.},

Radar observations of the responsible convective systems show deep overshooting at altitudes up to 4 km above the lapse rate tropopause and above the flight ceilings of the aircraft. Backward trajectories from the in situ observations show that convectively injected water vapor is observed from three distinct types of systems: isolated convection, a convective line, and a leading line-trailing stratiform mesoscale convective system. Significant transport of additional tropospheric or boundary layer trace gases is observed only for the leading line-trailing stratiform case. In addition, all observations of convective injection are found to occur within large-scale double-tropopause events from poleward Rossby wave breaking. Based on this relationship, we present a hypothesis on the role of the large-scale lower stratosphere during convective overshooting. In particular, the reduced lower stratosphere stability associated with double-tropopause environments may facilitate deeper levels of overshooting and convective injection.},

Despite knowledge of their occurrence, the precise mechanisms and atmospheric conditions leading to their formation and maintenance are not entirely known. Here, the formation of these cirrus ``plumes'' is examined using a combination of satellite imagery, four-dimensional ground-based radar observations, assimilated atmospheric states from a state-of-the-art reanalysis, and idealized numerical simulations with explicitly resolved convection. Using data from 20 recent events (2013\textendash present), it is found that convective cores of storms with above-anvil cirrus plumes reach altitudes 1\textendash 6 km above the tropopause. Thus, it is likely that these clouds represent the injection of cloud material into the lower stratosphere. Comparison of storms with above-anvil cirrus plumes and observed tropopause-penetrating convection without plumes reveals an association with large vector differences between the motion of a storm and the environmental wind in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS), suggesting that gravity wave breaking and/or stretching of the tropopause-penetrating cloud are/is more prevalent in plume-producing storms. A weak relationship is found between plume occurrence and the stability of the lower stratosphere (or tropopause structure), and no relationship is found with the duration of stratospheric penetration or stratospheric humidity. Idealized model simulations of tropopause-penetrating convection with small and large magnitudes of storm-relative wind in the UTLS are found to reproduce the observationally established storm-relative wind relationship and show that frequent gravity wave breaking is the primary mechanism responsible for plume formation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Extreme heat events are a threat to human health, productivity, and food supply, so understanding their drivers is critical to adaptation and resilience. Anticyclonic circulation and certain quasistationary Rossby wave patterns are well-known to coincide with heatwaves, and soil moisture deficits amplify extreme heat in some regions. However, the relative roles of these two factors in causing heatwaves is still unclear. Here we use constructed circulation analogs to estimate the contribution of atmospheric circulation to United States heatwaves in the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1) preindustrial control simulations. After accounting for the component of the heatwaves explained by circulation, we explore the relationship between the residual temperature anomalies and soil moisture. We find that circulation explains over 85\% of heatwave temperature anomalies in the eastern and western US, but only 75-85\% in the central US. In this region, there is a significant negative correlation between soil moisture the week before the heatwave and the strength of the heatwave that explains additional variance. Further, for the hottest central US heatwaves, positive temperature anomalies and negative soil moisture anomalies are evident over a month before heatwave onset. These results provide evidence that positive land-atmosphere feedbacks may be amplifying heatwaves in the central US and demonstrate the geographic heterogeneity in the relative importance of the land and atmosphere for heatwave development. Analysis of future circulation and soil moisture in the CESM1 Large Ensemble indicates that over parts of the US, both may be trending towards greater heatwave likelihood.},

Further, a number of these studies have attributed present-day changes in the risk of individual heat events and the documented global-scale increase in such events to anthropogenic-driven warming. Advances in process-based studies of heat events have focused on the proximate land-atmosphere interactions through soil moisture anomalies, and changes in occurrence of the underlying atmospheric circulation associated with heat events in the midlatitudes. While evidence for a number of hypotheses remains limited, climate change nevertheless points to tail risks of possible changes in heat extremes that could exceed estimates generated from model outputs of mean temperature.

  abstract = {Large-scale wave propagation ideas have proved extremely valuable in interpreting real and model data. These ideas have been developed in the context of barotropic models, and here the extension to baroclinic atmospheres is investigated. The dispersion of waves from an initial, large-scale, tropical perturbation to a baroclinic basic flow is studied using a direct approach. A 15-level, spectral, primitive equation model is integrated forward in time. Even in baroclinically unstable flows it is found that for a period, normally of order 12 days, the model yields what can be considered to be the direct response to the tropical perturbations. After this time baroclinic instability dominates. The basic flows are a resting atmosphere, a climatological westerly, an equatorial longitudinal modification to this, and a 3-D climatological December-February state. For the perturbations used here, equatorial Kelvin waves play only a very small role. The large-scale equatorial Rossby wave shows only small dispersion and tends to move with a Doppler-shifted phase speed which allows it to `accumulate' to the east of an equatorial maximum of 10 ms-1 or more. Rossby wavetrains propagate into the middle and high latitude westerly regions. With the climatological flow, perturbations in the Indian Ocean-west Pacific sector trigger a modal structure in the North Pacific and wavetrain across North America very much as barotropic theory would suggest and similar to observed Pacific-North America (PNA) patterns. In such a flow the middle latitude waves tend to extend to the equator in the westerly regions of the east Pacific and Atlantic, in agreement with observed behaviour.},

  abstract = {Abstract The aim of this paper is to explore the use of both an Eulerian and system-centered method of storm track diagnosis applied to a wide range of meteorological fields at multiple levels to provide a range of perspectives on the Northern Hemisphere winter transient motions and to give new insight into the storm track organization and behavior. The data used are primarily from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalyses project extended with operational analyses to the period 1979\textendash 2000. This is supplemented by data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and Goddard Earth Observing System 1 reanalyses. The range of fields explored include the usual mean sea level pressure and the lower- and upper-tropospheric height, meridional wind, vorticity, and temperature, as well as the potential vorticity (PV) on a 330-K isentropic surface (PV330) and potential temperature on a PV = 2 PVU surface (\texttheta PV2). As well as reporting the primary analysis based on feature tracking, the standard Eulerian 2\textendash 6-day bandpass filtered variance analysis is also reported and contrasted with the tracking diagnostics. To enable the feature points to be identified as extrema for all the chosen fields, a planetary wave background structure is removed at each data time. The bandpass filtered variance derived from the different fields yield a rich picture of the nature and comparative magnitudes of the North Pacific and Atlantic storm tracks, and of the Siberian and Mediterranean candidates for storm tracks. The feature tracking allows the cyclonic and anticyclonic activities to be considered seperately. The analysis indicates that anticyclonic features are generally much weaker with less coherence than the cyclonic systems. Cyclones and features associated with them are shown to have much greater coherence and give tracking diagnostics that create a vivid storm track picture that includes the aspects highlighted by the variances as well as highlighting aspects that are not readily available from Eulerian studies. In particular, the upper-tropospheric features as shown by negative \texttheta PV2, for example, occur in a band spiraling around the hemisphere from the subtropical North Atlantic eastward to the high latitudes of the same ocean basin. Lower-troposphere storm tracks occupy more limited longitudinal sectors, with many of the individual storms possibly triggered from the upper-tropospheric disturbances in the spiral band of activity.},

  abstract = {Abstract A detailed view of Southern Hemisphere storm tracks is obtained based on the application of filtered variance and modern feature-tracking techniques to a wide range of 45-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. It has been checked that the conclusions drawn in this study are valid even if data from only the satellite era are used. The emphasis of the paper is on the winter season, but results for the four seasons are also discussed. Both upper- and lower-tropospheric fields are used. The tracking analysis focuses on systems that last longer than 2 days and are mobile (move more than 1000 km). Many of the results support previous ideas about the storm tracks, but some new insights are also obtained. In the summer there is a rather circular, strong, deep high-latitude storm track. In winter the high-latitude storm track is more asymmetric with a spiral from the Atlantic and Indian Oceans in toward Antarctica and a subtropical jet\textendash related lower-latitude storm track over the Pacific, again tending to spiral poleward. At all times of the year, maximum storm activity in the higher-latitude storm track is in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions. In the winter upper troposphere, the relative importance of, and interplay between, the subtropical and subpolar storm tracks is discussed. The genesis, lysis, and growth rate of lower-tropospheric winter cyclones together lead to a vivid picture of their behavior that is summarized as a set of overlapping plates, each composed of cyclone life cycles. Systems in each plate appear to feed the genesis in the next plate through downstream development in the upper-troposphere spiral storm track. In the lee of the Andes in South America, there is cyclogenesis associated with the subtropical jet and also, poleward of this, cyclogenesis largely associated with system decay on the upslope and regeneration on the downslope. The genesis and lysis of cyclones and anticyclones have a definite spatial relationship with each other and with the Andes. At 500 hPa, their relative longitudinal positions are consistent with vortex-stretching ideas for simple flow over a large-scale mountain. Cyclonic systems near Antarctica have generally spiraled in from lower latitudes. However, cyclogenesis associated with mobile cyclones occurs around the Antarctic coast with an interesting genesis maximum over the sea ice near 150\textdegree E. The South Pacific storm track emerges clearly from the tracking as a coherent deep feature spiraling from Australia to southern South America. A feature of the summer season is the genesis of eastward-moving cyclonic systems near the tropic of Capricorn off Brazil, in the central Pacific and, to a lesser extent, off Madagascar, followed by movement along the southwest flanks of the subtropical anticyclones and contribution to the ``convergence zone'' cloud bands seen in these regions.},

This paper addresses the diagnosis problem for other averaging operators and, in particular, for time averaging which has proved in recent years such a powerful means of viewing the three-dimensional tropospheric flow. The horizontal velocity correlation tensor gives a measure of the characteristic horizontal eddy shape at a point. It also implies the direction of the group velocity relative to the mean flow in cases where such a concept is valid. However the major emphasis here is on the mean-flow feedback of eddies. In this respect, the eddy vorticity flux is determined by derivatives of the components of the anisotropic part of the tensor. Making a reasonable approximation allows the eddy vorticity flux convergence to be written in terms of E = (v{${'}$}2 - u{${'}$}2\textasciimacron, u{${'}$}v{${'}$}\textasciimacron ). A simple interpretation of the mean flow feedback of eddies is then possible. A slightly more restrictive approximation allows the eddy shape and the sense of the relative group velocity to be determined also from E. The whole analysis may also be performed in the three-dimensional quasi-geostrophic case where it provides an approximate extension of the Eliassen-Palm flux concept. The theory and approximations are investigated for high-pass and low-pass transient eddies using data for single Northern and Southern Hemisphere winter seasons. The different signatures of the transient eddies in the two frequency bands are apparent and schematic pictures of the contrasting, dominant behavior in each band emerge. Data from one particular blocking event, when diagnosed using the theory developed here, give an indication of a positive feedback of the synoptic eddies onto the mean blocking flow.},

For a better representation of the average atmospheric wind and shear and their variabilities, high-resolution radiosonde wind profiles up to about 30 km altitude are compared with the collocated operational ECMWF model for short-range forecast winds. Statistics of zonal and meridional winds are established from both data sets. The results show mainly similarity in the probability distributions of the modeled and observed horizontal winds, practically at all levels of the atmosphere, while at the same time the vertical shear of the wind is substantially underestimated in the model. The comparison of shear statistics of radiosonde and ECMWF model winds shows that the model wind shear mean and variability are on average a factor of 2.5 (zonal) and 3 (meridional) smaller than of radiosondes in the free troposphere, while in the stratosphere, the planetary boundary layer results are more variable. By applying vertical averaging to the radiosonde data, it is found that the effective vertical resolution of the ECMWF model is typically 1.7 km. Moreover, it is found for individually collocated radiosonde model wind and shear profiles that the model wind may lack in some cases variability larger than 5 m s-1 and 0.015 s-1, respectively, due mainly to the effect of lacking vertical resolution, in particular near the jets. Besides the general importance of this study in highlighting the difference in the representation of the atmospheric wind shear by model and observations, it is more specifically relevant for the future Atmospheric Dynamics Mission (ADM-Aeolus) of the European Space Agency due for launch in 2012. The results presented here are used to generate a realistic global atmospheric database, which is necessary to conduct simulations of the Aeolus Doppler wind lidar in order optimize its vertical sampling and processing.},

  abstract = {Abstract The mixing of a passive tracer by realistic time-dependent stratospheric flow (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts winds) on an isentropic surface (420 K) is studied. Simulations of the advection\textendash diffusion problem for an initially large-scale tracer field are carried out in the limit of weak diffusivity. Owing to chaotic advection, tracer variance is cascaded to small scales, where it can be dissipated despite the weak diffusivity. The tracer fluctuations are characterized in terms of their probability distribution function (PDF). The PDFs are characterized by a Gaussian core and ``fat tails,'' which fall more slowly than a Gaussian, and indicate anomalously high probability of extreme concentration fluctuations. Given the nonlinearity of many chemical reactions of interest, the anomalous prevalence of extreme fluctuations could have a profound effect on reactive tracers. Zonal variations of tracer are homogenized globally leading to a unimodal PDF. Initially meridional variations are strongly influenced by the presence of mixing barriers. Meridional gradients homogenize only within mixing zones of limited latitudinal extent, bounded by permeable mixing barriers. The PDF becomes multimodal, with distinct populations of air caused by blending of the concentration values within each mixing zone. The Tropics is a zone of weak mixing, and serves as an important repository of stratospheric tracers, which are episodically ejected into surf zones in the form of filaments bearing extreme concentration values. The shapes of the PDFs are discussed in terms of theoretical methods developed in the context of highly idealized mixing models. It is shown that such methods retain their utility when applied to realistic stratospheric mixing. The role of the probability distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents for the underlying trajectory problem is highlighted. The use of conditional averages of diffusion and dissipation is also illustrated. PDFs yielded by the idealized advection\textendash diffusion problem are found to resemble those appearing in a GCM simulation of N2O. The theoretical arguments and numerical results imply that under the assumption that the diffusivity is set so that the dissipation scale is comparable to model resolution, the concentration PDF eventually reaches a universal shape independent of model resolution after an initial transient stage. However, the width of the distribution, or equivalently the variance of the tracer fluctuation, increases algebraically as model resolution is refined.},

  abstract = {In the context of climate feedback associated with temperature change, there exist two potential mechanisms that affect the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and the downward longwave radiation (DLR). One is the ``Planck'' effect that determines the blackbody thermal emission at a considered temperature. The other is the ``absorptivity'' effect, in which a temperature change causes a change in gas absorptivities and thus influences the longwave radiative transfer. By using the line-by-line computed radiative Jacobians, which quantify the sensitivity of the radiative fluxes to a perturbation in the atmospheric temperature, the absorptivity effect is separated from the Planck effect. The absorptivity effect is further partitioned into components, with each one having a distinct physical meaning. It is demonstrated that the absorptivity-induced changes in the longwave radiation are individually significant even though the net effect is largely one of cancellation. As a consequence, the Planck effect dominates the overall OLR and DLR sensitivities to temperature change. The absorptivity effect tends to counteract the Planck effect. This tendency is particularly significant for the DLR and is more prominent for a warmer climate, with the result being a reduction in the surface warming.},

However, the role of clouds in these feedbacks remains unclear since the causality between clouds and these processes is complex. Here, we use NASA CERES satellite products and NCAR CESM model simulations to suggest that summertime low clouds have played an important role in driving sea ice melt by amplifying the adiabatic warming induced by a stronger anticyclonic circulation aloft. The upper-level high pressure regulates low clouds through stronger downward motion and increasing lower troposphere relative humidity. The increased low clouds favor more sea ice melt via emitting stronger longwave radiation. Then decreased surface albedo triggers a positive ice-albedo feedback, which further enhances sea ice melt. Considering the importance of summertime low clouds, accurate simulation of this process is a prerequisite for climate models to produce reliable future projections of Arctic sea ice.},

In both regions, the low-level meridional heat flux fuels LWA on seasonal timescales but the zonal LWA flux convergence and diabatic effects dominate the synoptic variability. Cospectral analysis shows that the interplay between barotropic zonal wind and column-averaged LWA through the meridional eddy momentum flux convergence is significant over the Pacific but not the Atlantic.

Measuring the strength of each feedback is of critical importance for understanding the climate sensitivity and its spread in climate models. Most feedback analyses to-date, such as those using the kernel method, have been based on a linear decomposition of the radiation budget and neglect the nonlinear effects between the feedbacks. In this work, we quantify the coupling effects between different longwave radiative feedbacks based on partial radiative perturbations using a radiative transfer model. Two climate change scenarios, the El ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the quadrupling CO2 (4xCO2), are examined. We find that the coupling effect between water vapor and cloud is the strongest among all the coupling effects and can amount to 50\% or greater of the univariate cloud feedback. This significant coupling effect results from the masking effect of the two feedbacks on each other and can be well explained by a simple analytic model.},

A spectral perspective of this ``super-greenhouse effect'' is provided, which demonstrates the roles of water vapor line and continuum absorptions at different altitudes and the influences due to clouds. A model-satellite comparison indicates that the GFDL General Circulation Model can fairly well represent the total-sky radiative response to SST in the water vapor infrared absorption band despite the significant bias in the mean state, but this comprises compensating water vapor- and cloud-related errors. The analysis also reveals that the GCM significantly underestimates the cloud induced radiative responses in the window region which arises from the model bias in the mean cloud forcing in convectively active regions. Thus, spectral decomposition proves essential to understand and assess the OLR-SST relationship and the impacts of water vapor and cloud upon this linkage.},

In addition, we separate and compare the effects of CO2 forcing to various feedbacks on atmospheric and oceanic PETs, by using a set of radiative kernels that we have developed for both TOA and surface radiation fluxes. The results here show that both the enhancement of atmospheric PET and weakening of oceanic PET during global warming are directly driven by the meridional gradients of the CO2 forcing. Interestingly, the overall feedback effect is to reinforce the forcing effect, mainly through the cloud feedback in the case of atmospheric PET and the albedo feedback in the case of the oceanic PET. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the water vapor feedback only has a weak effect on atmospheric PET.

Our model results suggest that conditions during the LPTM were more equable relative to the late Paleocene or early Eocene, with the mean annual temperature range reduced by more than 5\textdegree C over much of the continental interiors and precipitation over land increased by 5\textendash 10\%. Nevertheless, despite specifying warm polar SSTs which exclude sea-ice, the model produces January continental interior temperatures less than -13\textdegree C, in contrast to proxy data estimates of higher temperatures. The zonal wind strength is drastically reduced during the LPTM, and during Northern Hemisphere winter, deep atmospheric convection over the Arctic Sea is generated owing to the specified warm SSTs. We calculate substantial wind-driven ocean circulation response to model-produced wind fields for these time intervals, including increases in inferred western boundary current strength of 8\textendash 28\%. In general, our results are in agreement with deep-sea sediment-derived clay and eolian records which suggest warm, wet conditions with less vigorous atmospheric circulation during these time periods.

  abstract = {Opening of Southern Ocean gateways may have had a controlling influence on the evolution of global climate. The largest step in the history of Cenozoic climate, from an Eocene ``Greenhouse'' toward the modern glaciated state, is correlated with opening of a deep water connection between the Southern Indian and Southern Pacific Oceans. This study synthesizes results from previous work, assesses the possibility that ocean heat transport was much greater than modern during the globally warm Eocene, and explores the sensitivity of polar climate to large changes in ocean heat transport. The magnitudes of these sensitivities are compared with those due to greenhouse gas concentration changes. We find that ocean heat transport was unlikely to have been sufficiently greater than modern during the Eocene to explain the change in the climate. Specifically, in order to have significantly affected Antarctic climate, ocean heat transport changes would have had to change by an order of magnitude\textemdash much greater than the largest change produced in our simulations. In coupled climate model simulations, changes in CO2 concentrations(from 1120 to 560 ppm) supported by proxy records, lead to significant Antarctic responses in the absence of ocean heat transport changes. The results show that Antarctic snow accumulation is primarily controlled by changes in summer temperature, not precipitation, and that snow did not remain on Antarctica during summer months in Eocene even at low greenhouse gas concentrations. Greenhouse gas concentration changes and subsequent processes such as ice albedo and weathering feedbacks, were more likely to have been the primary cause of Antarctic glaciation than ocean heat transport changes.},

These past climates\textemdash about 10\textdegree{} warmer than modern\textemdash provide valuable lessons in the climate dynamics of a world with higher-than-modern greenhouse-gas concentrations, reduced temperature gradients, and a lack of polar ice. Some key points that emerge from this analysis are: 1) Past greenhouse climates are characterized by warmer-than-modern global mean temperatures and winter season warmth, as well as strong polar amplification of warming that generates weak meridional temperature gradients. 2) A trade-off exists between heat transport in a warmer world and a world with smaller temperature gradients; a range exists in which a warmer world with weak temperature gradients can transport as much heat as a cooler world with stronger gradients. 3) These features can be reproduced in models if global mean and tropical temperatures are allowed to increase significantly over modern values. 4) Local radiative-convective feedbacks play an important role, perhaps dominating over transport, or acting in conjunction with transport to maintain relatively warm, weak temperature gradient climates. 5) Past greenhouse climates appear to have many of the modern modes of variability from orbital to interannual. 6) Modeling efforts are most useful when done independently of proxy data; model output can then be compared with proxies to evaluate potential weaknesses in the model. 7) Model-data mismatch might be due to incorrect boundary or initial conditions or resolution, or to missing or incomplete representation of relevant physics. 8) Refinements and new developments in proxies for temperature and other variables offer much potential for discriminating among the next generation of modeled scenarios, thereby allowing a better understanding of the conditions under which greenhouse climates exist.},

Features of simulated blockings well resemble that in the real atmosphere, showing typical {$\Omega$}-like patterns, persistence, and quasi-stationary behavior with occasionally westward shifting. It is found that the onset and maintenance of simulated blockings are due to interaction between quasi-stationary free Rossby waves and baroclinic eddies. For 10-year simulations, the blocking frequency is slightly higher than that in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in the real atmosphere. These suggest that blocking is a natural consequence of rotating and baroclinic atmospheres, while locally topographic forcing and remote tropical forcing are not necessary conditions.},

Apart from precipitation input, post-depositional processes such as wind-driven redistribution and vapor\textendash snow exchange processes at and below the surface are hypothesized to contribute to the isotope climate signal subsequently stored in the ice. Recent field studies have shown that surface snow isotopes vary between precipitation events and co-vary with vapor isotopes, which demonstrates that vapor\textendash snow exchange is an important driving mechanism. Here we investigate how vapor\textendash snow exchange processes influence the isotopic composition of the snowpack. Controlled laboratory experiments under forced sublimation show an increase in snow isotopic composition of up to 8 \textperthousand{} \emph{{$\delta$}}\textsuperscript{18}O in the uppermost layer due to sublimation, with an attenuated signal down to 3 cm snow depth over the course of 4\textendash 6 d. This enrichment is accompanied by a decrease in the second-order parameter d-excess, indicating kinetic fractionation processes. Our observations confirm that sublimation alone can lead to a strong enrichment of stable water isotopes in surface snow and subsequent enrichment in the layers below. To compare laboratory experiments with realistic polar conditions, we completed four 2\textendash 3 d field experiments at the East Greenland Ice Core Project site (northeast Greenland) in summer 2019. High-resolution temporal sampling of both natural and isolated snow was conducted under clear-sky conditions and demonstrated that the snow isotopic composition changes on hourly timescales. A change of snow isotope content associated with sublimation is currently not implemented in isotope-enabled climate models and is not taken into account when interpreting ice core isotopic records. However, our results demonstrate that post-depositional processes such as sublimation contribute to the climate signal recorded in the water isotopes in surface snow, in both laboratory and field settings. This suggests that the ice core water isotope signal may effectively integrate across multiple parameters, and the ice core climate record should be interpreted as such, particularly in regions of low accumulation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The simulated time-mean climate is reasonable, near observations and RCE of a cyclic cloud-resolving model. Updraft detrainment in the deep convection scheme produces distinctive grid-scale structures in humidity and cloud, which also interact with radiative transfer processes. These grid artifacts average out in multi-column RCE results reported elsewhere, illustrating the nuts-and-bolts interpretability that SCAM adds to the hierarchy of model configurations. Multi-day oscillations of precipitation arise from descent of warm convection-capping layers starting near the tropopause, eventually reset by a burst of convective deepening. Experiments reveal how these oscillations depend critically on an internal parameter that controls the number of neutral buoyancy levels allowed for determining cloud top and computing dilute convective available potential energy in the deep convection scheme, and merely modified a little by disabling cloud-base radiation (heating of cloud base). This strong dependence of transient behavior in 1D on this parameter will be tested in the second part of this work, in which SCAM is coupled to a parameterized dynamics of two-dimensional, linearized gravity wave, and in the 3D simulations in future study.},

The model allows us to separate the effects of tropospheric lapse rate, optical depth, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and stratospheric cooling on the tropopause height. When applied locally at each latitudinal band, the model predicts the overall meridional structure of the tropopause height, with a tropical tropopause substantially higher than in higher latitudes and a sharp transition at the edge of the extratropics. The large optical depth of the Tropics, due mainly to the large water-vapour path, is the dominant tropospheric effect producing the higher tropical tropopause, whereas the larger tropical lapse rate actually acts to lower the tropopause height. The dynamical cooling induced by the stratospheric circulation lifts the thermal tropopause in the Tropics further, resulting in it being significantly cooler and higher than in mid- and high-latitudes. The model quantifies the causes of the tropopause height increase with global warming that is found robustly in climate integrations from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The large spread in the increase rate of tropopause height in the CMIP5 model is captured by the simple model, which attributes the dominant contributions to changes in water-vapour path and lapse rate, with changes in CO2 concentration and OLR having much smaller direct effects. The CMIP5 models also show a small but robust increase in the tropopause temperature in low latitudes, with a much smaller increase in higher latitudes. We suggest that the tropical increase may be caused at least in part by nongrey effects in the radiative transfer associated with the higher levels of water vapour in the Tropics, with near-constant tropopause temperatures predicted otherwise.},

Using two reanalysis products and two global precipitation datasets, the authors examine linear relationships between seasonal anomalies of precipitation and subcloud equivalent potential temperature (\texttheta eb) local to six monsoon regions. This approach provides a single near-surface thermodynamically relevant variable over both land and ocean, extending previous studies of interannual monsoon variability that emphasized ocean surface temperatures. After removing the variability linearly associated with an index of the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, positive monsoon precipitation anomalies are shown to be associated with enhanced \texttheta eb local to and slightly poleward of the climatological \texttheta eb maximum. The variations in continental \texttheta eb local to the monsoon precipitation maxima are mainly due to variations in subcloud specific humidity, with changes in subcloud temperature having the opposite sign. Motivated by the fact that some of these subcloud humidity anomalies occur over deserts poleward of monsoon regions, the relationship of 700-hPa flow with precipitation is examined, and enhanced precipitation in several regions is found to covary with the properties of shallow meridional circulations. The implications of these results for the understanding of monsoon interannual variability are discussed.},

In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon\textendash climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015\textendash 2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models. With most ESM simulations for CMIP6 now completed, it is important to document the land use patterns used by those simulations. Here we present results from the Land-Use Harmonization 2 (LUH2) project, which smoothly connects updated historical reconstructions of land use with eight new future projections in the format required for ESMs. The harmonization strategy estimates the fractional land use patterns, underlying land use transitions, key agricultural management information, and resulting secondary lands annually, while minimizing the differences between the end of the historical reconstruction and IAM initial conditions and preserving changes depicted by the IAMs in the future.

This increase in low cloud amount and optical thickness could reduce surface radiative cooling and suppress Arctic air formation events, partly explaining both the warm winter high-latitude continental interior climate and frost-intolerant species found there during the Eocene and the positive lapse-rate feedback in future Arctic climate change scenarios. Here the authors examine the robustness of this low-cloud mechanism in a three-dimensional atmospheric model that includes large-scale dynamics. Different warming scenarios are simulated under prescribed CO\textsubscript{2} and sea surface temperature, and the sensitivity of winter temperatures and clouds over high-latitude continental interior to mid- and high-latitude sea surface temperatures is examined. Model results show that winter 2-m temperatures on extreme cold days increase about 50\% faster than the winter mean temperatures and the prescribed SST. Low cloud fraction and surface longwave cloud radiative forcing also increase in both the winter mean state and on extreme cold days, consistent with previous Lagrangian air-mass studies, but with cloud fraction increasing for different reasons than proposed by previous work. At high latitudes, the cloud longwave warming effect dominates the shortwave cooling effect, and the net cloud radiative forcing at the surface tends to warm high-latitude land but cool midlatitude land. This could contribute to the reduced meridional temperature gradient in warmer climates and help explain the greater warming of winter cold extremes relative to winter mean temperatures.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Enhanced Arctic warming weakens the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and decreases atmospheric dry static energy transport, a decrease that often outweighs increases from atmospheric moisture transport and ocean heat transport.

  abstract = {The water vapour feedback is the largest physical climate feedback. It also gives the second-largest contribution to the range of uncertainty in climate sensitivity in General Circulation Models (GCMs). Tracing these differences back to their physical causes in the hope of constraining climate sensitivity requires an appropriate quantification. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change judge that the conventional diagnosis of a ``water vapour feedback'' and a ``lapse rate feedback'' provides little insight into differences between GCMs' climate sensitivities. We show that the conventionally diagnosed water vapour feedback is in fact formally useless for investigating differences between GCMs' climate sensitivities\textemdash the anticorrelation between conventional ``water vapour feedback'' and ``lapse rate feedback'' makes the correlation between the ``water vapour feedback'' and their sum insignificant: i.e. statistically, knowing this ``feedback'' allows one to conclude nothing about the sum and thence about climate sensitivity. This follows primarily from how little relative humidity (RH) changes with climate change in GCMs. A more detailed physical analysis concludes that the overall mean decrease of RH on warming seen in GCMs is robustly physically based. This and other physical arguments then suggest that the stronger the positive ``water vapour feedback'', the less sensitive climate can be expected to be. A diagnosis based on the ``partly-Simpsonian'' model of water vapour feedback avoids these problems. On the conventional view of the water vapour feedback, naive extrapolation of variations within present-day climate suggests that parts of our planet are close to locally reaching conditions that would allow a run-away water vapour greenhouse effect once they were extensive enough. Of course this has never occurred in geological history, and is not seen in Earth-like GCMs. Again, the ``partly-Simpsonian'' approach provides a simple qualitative explanation, by showing that the water vapour feedback can only cancel part of the basic Planck's Law negative feedback.},

  abstract = {Many of the current, Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6), General Circulation Models (GCMs) show climate sensitivity higher than currently accepted uncertainty ranges. There is a weak correlation between increases in vertical resolution and in climate sensitivity from CMIP5. In particular, the MO Hadley Centre GCM's vertical resolution has more than doubled, and its climate sensitivity has also increased substantially. We therefore compare estimates of climate sensitivity from the CMIP6 model HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL, with 85 levels, and a version with 242 levels. This is far higher resolution than in any previously published simulations with a mainstream GCM, though still less than many scales important for clouds. The climate sensitivity and feedbacks, including the cloud feedback, change little. This suggests that vertical resolution did not drive recent increases in GCM climate sensitivity, though this result should be further tested in other GCMs and over a broader range of resolutions.},

  abstract = {Climate sensitivity is often said to be doubled by water vapour feedback. We expect the distribution of relative humidity to change little under climate change from simple physical arguments, which are confirmed by the most detailed physical models we have, and consistent with the limited observational evidence. A substantial positive feedback on climate change is then to be expected, and an approximate doubling is well established numerically. However, a physical explanation for the size of this effect is conspicuously lacking. We consider an idealized numerical model of Simpson's. Its counter-intuitive result \textendash that OLR does not change as climate warms \textendash is shown to be more general than often thought, though clearly not applicable to our planet as it stands. However, with certain physical approximations a `partly-Simpsonian' generalization can be derived: that the component radiated by water vapour does not change as the climate system warms, while that radiated by everything else increases following Planck's Law. While still not quantitatively accurate, this does provide a physical explanation for the general size of the water vapour feedback, as well as for its robustness in GCMs. The partly-Simpsonian approach also provides a physical explanation for the well-established fact that, in water-vapour-dominated regions of the spectrum, the heat radiated by the climate system is a function primarily of relative humidity, not temperature. \textcopyright{} Crown Copyright 2010.

  abstract = {The clear-sky longwave component of the climate sensitivity parameter{$\lambda$}CSLWis estimated for 5 diverse state-of-the-art general circulation models (GCMs). A common radiation code is used to calculate 2 alternative breakdowns. The conventional breakdown, into ``surface temperature feedback'', ``lapse rate feedback'' and ``water vapor feedback'' shows only the well-known result of large but mostly compensating variations in the latter two components, due to variations in the distribution of warming. In one GCM,{$\lambda$}CSLW is rather stronger than the rest, tending to reduce the sensitivity of climate. The ``partly Simpsonian'' breakdown shows that this is because of a combination of having less water vapor to start with and less increase in water vapor around the tropopause on warming. Two GCMs show {$\lambda$}CSLWrather weaker than the rest, because of weaker amplification of the warming aloft, in one case combined with stronger-than-average relative humidity increases. The net effect of greater lapse rate changes (proportionally more warming aloft) can be seen to tend consistently to reduce climate sensitivity slightly. Also, though the impact of relative humidity changes is dominated by reductions through most of the depth of the troposphere, its variation across GCMs is dominated by increases around the tropopause. While the results from so small a sample will not be quantitatively general, they suggest that applying the new breakdown to a much wider range of GCMs would give useful quantitative and physical information on the variation of{$\lambda$}CSLW across current GCMs.},

Assessing the influence of anthropogenic warming on Arctic coastal dynamics, however, is challenged by the limited availability of observational, oceanographic and environmental data. Yet, with the majority of permafrost coasts being erosive, coupled with projected intensification of erosion and flooding, understanding these changes is critical. In this Review, we describe the morphological diversity of Arctic coasts, discuss important drivers of coastal change, explain the specific sensitivity of Arctic coasts to climate change and provide an overview of pan-Arctic shoreline change and its multifaceted impacts. Arctic coastal changes impact the human environment by threatening coastal settlements, infrastructure, cultural sites and archaeological remains. Changing sediment fluxes also impact the natural environment through carbon, nutrient and pollutant release on a magnitude that remains difficult to predict. Increasing transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary collaboration efforts will build the foundation for identifying sustainable solutions and adaptation strategies to reduce future risks for those living on, working at and visiting the rapidly changing Arctic coast.},

  abstract = {Abstract Twenty-eight years of NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis data are employed in a composite analysis of the structure and evolution of the large-scale circulation associated with rapid, subseasonal, westward retractions of the Northern Hemisphere Pacific jet. Nineteen Pacific jet retractions are identified in the dataset. The salient characteristics of these transitions are presented, emphasizing the structure and evolution of anomalies in the zonal wind, upper-tropospheric geopotential height, sea level pressure (SLP), and tropopause potential vorticity (PV). The composite analysis demonstrates that as the jet retracts, a transition from a dominant negative anomaly to a dominant positive anomaly across the North Pacific in both the 500-hPa geopotential height and SLP fields occurs in \textasciitilde 10 days. The resulting anticyclonic anomalies are sprawling and intense with SLP anomalies of nearly 20 hPa and 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies of more than 200 m. The vertical superposition of these upper- and lower-level anomalies indicates that these composite structures are equivalent barotropic. These results are also consistent with the composite 200\textendash 250-hPa Ertel PV anomaly field, in which a jet retraction event is characterized by the formation of a zonally elongated, meridionally oriented PV anomaly couplet in the central North Pacific that becomes increasingly isotropic in the jet exit region simultaneous with the retraction of the jet. Because of the large spatial scale of these events, the results are also discussed in the context of storm-track variability, the East Asian winter monsoon, and tropical diabatic heating anomalies.},

Time slices of winter atmospheric circulation with high (1990\textendash 2000) and low (2001\textendash 2010) sea ice concentration in the preceding August/September have been analysed with respect to tropospheric interactions between planetary and baroclinic waves. It is shown that a changed sea ice concentration over the Arctic Ocean impacts differently the development of synoptic and planetary atmospheric circulation systems. During the low ice phase, stronger heat release to the atmosphere over the Arctic Ocean reduces the atmospheric vertical static stability. This leads to an earlier onset of baroclinic instability that further modulates the non-linear interactions between baroclinic wave energy fluxes on time scales of 2.5\textendash 6 d and planetary scales of 10\textendash 90 d. Our analysis suggests that Arctic sea ice concentration changes exert a remote impact on the large-scale atmospheric circulation during winter, exhibiting a barotropic structure with similar patterns of pressure anomalies at the surface and in the mid-troposphere.

When deep convections are highly suppressed with a large Tokioka parameter, the model is capable of simulating distinct two-types of El Ni\~no. However, the model has a problem in simulating two-types of El Ni\~no distinctively when the Tokioka parameter is small, because the location of the maximum precipitation anomaly related to the CT El Ni\~no is significantly shifted westward, leading to an atmospheric response pattern similar to that of the WP El Ni\~no. Our results suggest that the mean precipitation over the eastern equatorial Pacific and the resultant zonal distribution in atmospheric feedback associated with ENSO can be one of the crucial factors for simulating two-types of El Ni\~no.},

  abstract = {Abstract The potential and serious effects of anthropogenic climate change are often communicated through the soundbite that anthropogenic climate change will produce more extreme weather. This soundbite has become popular with scientists and the media to get the public and governments to act against further increases in global temperature and their associated effects through the communication of scary scenarios, what the authors term ``atmosfear.'' Underlying atmosfear's appeal, however, are four premises. First, atmosfear reduces the complexity of climate change to an identifiable target in the form of anthropogenically forced weather extremes. Second, anthropogenically driven weather extremes mandate a responsibility to act to protect the planet and society from harmful and increased risk. Third, achieving these ethical goals is predicated on emissions policies. Fourth, the end result of these policies\textemdash a nonanthropogenic climate\textemdash is assumed to be more benign than an anthropogenically influenced one. Atmosfear oversimplifies and misstates the true state of the science and policy concerns in three ways. First, weather extremes are only one of the predicted effects of climate change and are best addressed by measures other than emission policies. Second, a preindustrial climate may remain a policy goal, but it is unachievable in reality. Third, the damages caused by any anthropogenically driven extremes may be overshadowed by the damages caused by increased exposure and vulnerability to the future risk. In reality, recent increases in damages and losses due to extreme weather events are due to societal factors. Thus, invoking atmosfear through such approaches as attribution science is not an effective means of either stimulating or legitimizing climate policies.},

Theoretical arguments and idealized numerical simulations suggest that enhanced buoyancy loss around Antarctica leads to a strong increase in the abyssal stratification, consistent with proxy observations for the last glacial maximum. Enhanced buoyancy loss moreover leads to a contraction of the middepth overturning cell and thus upward shift of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). The abyssal overturning cell initially expands to fill the void. However, if the buoyancy loss rate further increases, the abyssal cell also contracts, leaving a ``dead zone'' with vanishing meridional flow at middepth.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, an adequate parameterization of the interactions with the unresolved part of the eddy energy spectrum remains crucial. Hyperviscous closures, which are commonly applied in eddy-permitting ocean models, cause spurious energy dissipation at these resolutions, leading to low levels of eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and weak eddy induced transports. It has recently been proposed to counteract the spurious energy dissipation of hyperviscous closures by an additional forcing term, which represents ``backscatter'' of energy from the un-resolved scales to the resolved scales. This study proposes a parameterization of energy backscatter based on an explicit sub-grid EKE budget. Energy dissipated by hyperviscosity acting on the resolved flow is added to the sub-grid EKE, while a backscatter term transfers energy back from the sub-grid EKE to the resolved flow. The backscatter term is formulated deterministically via a negative viscosity, which returns energy at somewhat larger scales than the hyperviscous dissipation, thus ensuring dissipation of enstrophy. The parameterization is tested in an idealized configuration of a primitive equation ocean model, and is shown to significantly improve the solutions of simulations at typical eddy-permitting resolutions.},

Both the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and the static stability of the extratropical atmosphere are set by a balance between these eddy fluxes and the radiative forcing. Much attention has been paid to the adjustment of the isentropic slope, which relates the static stability and the meridional temperature gradient. It is often argued that the extratropical atmosphere always equilibrates such that isentropes leaving the surface in the subtropics reach the tropopause near the poles. However, recent work challenged this argument. This paper revisits scaling arguments for the equilibrated mean state of a dry atmosphere, which results from a balance between the radiative forcing and the along-isentropic eddy heat flux. These arguments predict weak sensitivity of the isentropic slope to changes in the radiative forcing, consistent with previous results. Large changes can, however, be achieved if other external parameters, such as the size and rotation rate of the planet, are varied. The arguments are also extended to predict both the meridional temperature gradient and the static stability independently. This allows a full characterization of the atmospheric mean state as a function of external parameters.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The closure proposed by Grooms accounts for the fact that eddy fluxes arise as the product of two approximately Gaussian variables, which in turn leads to a distinctly non-Gaussian distribution. The directionality of the stochastic eddy fluxes, however, remains somewhat ad-hoc and depends on the reference frame of the chosen coordinate system. This note presents a modification of the approach proposed by Grooms, which eliminates this shortcoming. Eddy fluxes are computed based on a stochastic mixing length model, which leads to a frame invariant formulation. As in the original closure proposed by Grooms, eddy fluxes are proportional to the product of two Gaussian variables, and the parameterization reduces to the Gent and McWilliams parameterization for the mean buyoancy fluxes.},

At this resolution models can produce reasonable eddy-like disturbances, but can still not properly resolve geostrophic eddies at all relevant scales. Adequate parameterizations representing sub-grid eddy effects are thus necessary. Most eddy-permitting models presently employ some kind of hyper-viscosity, which is shown to cause a significant amount of energy dissipation. However, comparison to higher resolution simulations shows that only enstrophy, but almost no energy, should be dissipated below the grid-scale. As a result of the artificial energy sink associated with viscous parameterizations, the eddy fields in eddy permitting models are generally not energetic enough. To overcome this problem, we propose a class of sub-grid parameterizations which dissipate enstrophy but little or no energy. The idea is to combine a standard hyperviscous closure with some mechanism to return dissipated energy to the resolved flow. Enstrophy dissipation remains ensured because the energy is returned at larger scales. Two simple ways to return the energy are proposed: one using a stochastic excitation and one using a negative Laplacian viscosity. Both approaches are tested in an idealized two-layer quasi-geostrophic model. Either approach is shown to greatly improve the solutions in simulations with typical eddy-permitting resolutions. The adaptation of the proposed parameterization for use in realistic ocean models is discussed.},

The model combines one-dimensional predictive residual advection\textendash diffusion equations for the buoyancy in the basin and Southern Ocean surface mixed layer with diagnostic relationships for the residual overturning circulation between these regions. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces the results from idealized general circulation model simulations and provides theoretical insights into the mechanisms that govern the response of the overturning circulation to an abrupt surface warming. Specifically, the model reproduces a rapid shoaling and weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in response to surface warming, followed by a partial recovery over the following decades to centuries, and a full recovery after multiple millennia. The rapid partial recovery is associated with adjustment of the lower thermocline, which itself is shown to be accelerated by the weakened AMOC. Full equilibration instead requires adjustment of the abyssal buoyancy, which is shown to be governed by diapycnal diffusion and surface fluxes around Antarctica.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, Earth's climate is not in a steady state, and a better understanding of the ocean's nonequilibrium response to changes in the surface climate is urgently needed. Here, the time-dependent response of the deep-ocean overturning circulation to atmospheric warming is examined using a hierarchy of idealized ocean models. The transient response to surface warming is characterized by a shoaling and weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)\textemdash consistent with results from coupled climate simulations. The initial shoaling and weakening of the AMOC occurs on decadal time scales and is attributed to a rapid warming of northern-sourced deep water. The equilibrium response to warming, in contrast, is associated with a deepening and strengthening of the AMOC. The eventual deepening of the AMOC is argued to be associated with abyssal density changes and driven by modified surface fluxes in the Southern Ocean, following a reduction of the Antarctic sea ice cover. Full equilibration of the AMOC requires a diffusive adjustment of the abyss and takes many millennia. The equilibration time scale is much longer than most coupled climate model simulations, highlighting the importance of considering integration time and initial conditions when interpreting the deep-ocean circulation in climate models. The results also show that past climates are unlikely to be an adequate analog for changes in the overturning circulation during the coming decades or centuries.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

As suggested previously, a turbulent flow is driven by geothermal heating at the seafloor, which is balanced by a similar heat loss through the ice sheet above. It is argued that the expected horizontal inhomogeneities in these heat fluxes are sufficient to generate baroclinic instability, which drives geostrophic turbulence. Turbulent eddies then transport heat upward and poleward along isolines of constant density, thereby maintaining a statically stable stratification, contrary to previous findings from numerical models that do not adequately resolve the geostrophic turbulence. The kinetic energy of the turbulent flow is expected to be controlled by a balance between the potential energy input by the diabatic forcing and frictional dissipation in the bottom boundary layer. The resulting characteristic flow speed is estimated to be on the order of 1 cm s\textsuperscript{-1}, which is in agreement with previous numerical simulations. Eddy diffusivities are estimated to be on the order of 100 m\textsuperscript{2} s\textsuperscript{-1}, which is smaller than in the present-day ocean but probably within one order of magnitude. Because of the weak forcing, the resulting gradients of temperature and salinity would be much smaller than in the present-day ocean, with global-scale potential temperature variations on the order of 0.1 K, again in agreement with previous numerical simulations. The presented theoretical arguments may also be relevant to other planetary bodies with an ice-covered ocean.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A substantial limitation is its underestimation of the peak P in the convergence zones, as the necessary processes associated with the atmospheric circulation are not considered. The pattern of the intermodel correlation between the mean \$\$T\_s-T\_c\$\$for each GCM and the average P distribution is in agreement with the double ITCZ bias, featuring roughly zonally-symmetric off-equatorial maxima, rather than being regionally or hemispherically restricted. The inter-comparison of GCMs indicates a relationship between \$\$T\_c\$\$with the near-equatorial low-level (850 hPa) tropospheric temperature, consistent with the interpretation that it is a measure of the convective inhibition (CIN). The underestimation of \$\$T\_c\$\$is linked to the cold free tropospheric bias in the GCMs. However, the discrepancy among the observational datasets is a limitation for assessing the GCM biases from the PEM framework quantitatively. Under the RCP4.5 climate change scenario, \$\$T\_c\$\$increases slightly more than the mean tropical \$\$T\_s\$\$, implying a stabilizing trend consistent with the amplified free tropospheric warming relative to the surface. However, since \$\$a\_1\$\$increases by 10\textendash 50\%/\$\$\^\textbackslash circ\$\$C with the surface warming, its effect dominates and results in generally positive precipitation change (\$\$\textbackslash Delta P\$\$) in the equatorial regions.

Here we extend the formalism of Wilson and Gea-Banacloche to obtain a quantitatively accurate analytical model for spatially varying instantaneous CO2 forcing, which depends only on surface temperature Ts, stratospheric temperature, and column relative humidity (RH). This model shows that CO2 forcing can be considered a swap of surface emission for stratospheric emission, and thus depends primarily on surface\textendash stratosphere temperature contrast. The strong meridional gradient in CO2 forcing is thus largely due to the strong meridional gradient in Ts. In the tropics and midlatitudes, however, the presence of H2O modulates the forcing by replacing surface emission with RH-dependent atmospheric emission. This substantially reduces the forcing in the tropics, introduces forcing variations due to spatially varying RH, and sets an upper limit (with respect to Ts variations) on CO2 forcing that is reached in the present-day tropics. In addition, we extend our analytical model to the instantaneous tropopause forcing, and find that this forcing depends on Ts only, with no dependence on stratospheric temperature. We also analyze the {$\tau$} = 1 approximation for the emission level and derive an exact formula for the emission level, which yields values closer to {$\tau$} = 1/2 than to {$\tau$} = 1.},

Here we identify and investigate one source of uncertainty by demonstrating a marked increase of anvil cloud fraction with resolution in cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium. This increase in cloud fraction can be traced back to the resolution dependence of horizontal mixing between clear and cloudy air. A mixing timescale is diagnosed for each simulation using the cloud fraction theory of Seeley, Jeevanjee, Langhans, and Romps (2019) (https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL080747) and is found to scale linearly with grid spacing, as expected from a simple scaling law. Thus mixing becomes more efficient with increasing resolution, generating more evaporation in middle and lower tropospheric updrafts. This decreases their precipitation efficiency (PE), thereby increasing their overall mass flux, leading to greater detrainment at the anvil level and hence higher anvil cloud fraction. The decrease in PE also yields a marked increase in relative humidity with resolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric radiative cooling is a fundamental aspect of Earth's greenhouse effect, and is intrinsically connected to atmospheric motions. At the same time, basic aspects of longwave radiative cooling, such as its characteristic value of 2 K day-1, its sharp decline (or ``kink'') in the upper troposphere, and the large values of CO2 cooling in the stratosphere, are difficult to understand intuitively or estimate with pencil and paper. Here we pursue such understanding by building simple spectral (rather than gray) models for clear-sky radiative cooling. We construct these models by combining the cooling-to-space approximation with simplified greenhouse gas spectroscopy and analytical expressions for optical depth, and we validate these simple models with line-by-line calculations. We find that cooling rates can be expressed as a product of the Planck function, a vertical emissivity gradient, and a characteristic spectral width derived from our simplified spectroscopy. This expression allows for a pencil-and-paper estimate of the 2 K day-1 tropospheric cooling rate, as well as an explanation of enhanced CO2 cooling rates in the stratosphere. We also link the upper-tropospheric kink in radiative cooling to the distribution of H2O absorption coefficients, and from this derive an analytical expression for the kink temperature Tkink {$\approx$} 220 K. A further, ancillary result is that gray models fail to reproduce basic features of atmospheric radiative cooling.},

  abstract = {We spectrally resolve the conventional clear-sky temperature and water vapor feedbacks in an idealized single-column framework, and show that the well-known partial compensation of these feedbacks is actually due to an almost perfect cancellation of the spectral feedbacks at wavenumbers where H2O is optically thick. This cancellation is a natural consequence of ``Simpson's Law'', which says that H2O emission temperatures do not change with surface warming if relative humidity (RH) is fixed. We provide an explicit formulation and validation of Simpson's Law, and furthermore show that this spectral cancellation of feedbacks is naturally incorporated in the alternative RH-based framework proposed by Held and Shell (2012, https://doi.org/10.1175/jcli-d-11-00721.1) and Ingram (2012, https://doi.org/10.1029/2011jd017221, 2013b, https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-012-1294-3), thus bolstering the case for switching from conventional to RH-based feedbacks. We also find a negligible RH-based clear-sky lapse rate feedback, suggesting that the impact of changing lapse rates depends crucially on whether relative or specific humidity is held fixed.},

  abstract = {Supercontinent assembly and breakup can influence the rate and global extent to which insulated and relatively warm subcontinental mantle is mixed globally, potentially introducing lateral oceanic-continental mantle temperature variations that regulate volcanic and weathering controls on Earth's long-term carbon cycle for a few hundred million years. We propose that the relatively warm and unchanging climate of the Nuna supercontinental epoch (1.8\textendash 1.3 Ga) is characteristic of thorough mantle thermal mixing. By contrast, the extreme cooling-warming climate variability of the Neoproterozoic Rodinia episode (1\textendash 0.63 Ga) and the more modest but similar climate change during the Mesozoic Pangea cycle (0.3\textendash 0.05 Ga) are characteristic features of the effects of subcontinental mantle thermal isolation with differing longevity. A tectonically modulated carbon cycle model coupled to a one-dimensional energy balance climate model predicts the qualitative form of Mesozoic climate evolution expressed in tropical sea-surface temperature and ice sheet proxy data. Applied to the Neoproterozoic, this supercontinental control can drive Earth into, as well as out of, a continuous or intermittently panglacial climate, consistent with aspects of proxy data for the Cryogenian-Ediacaran period. The timing and magnitude of this cooling-warming climate variability depends, however, on the detailed character of mantle thermal mixing, which is incompletely constrained. We show also that the predominant modes of chemical weathering and a tectonically paced abiotic methane production at mid-ocean ridges can modulate the intensity of this climate change. For the Nuna epoch, the model predicts a relatively warm and ice-free climate related to mantle dynamics potentially consistent with the intense anorogenic magmatism of this period.},

Thermodynamic processes also played a part, including record anomalous atmospheric heat ({$>$}138\,W\,m-2) and moisture ({$>$}300\,kg\,m-1s-1) fluxes from midlatitudes, along with ocean mixed-layer warming ({$>$}2\,\textdegree C).

  abstract = {Previous work has established that warming is associated with an increase in dry static stability, a weakening of the tropical circulation, and a decrease in the convective mass flux. Using a set of idealized simulations with specified surface warming and superparameterized convection, we find support for these previous conclusions. We use an energy and mass balance framework to develop a simple diagnostic that links the fractional area covered by the region of upward motion to the strength of the mean circulation. We demonstrate that the diagnostic works well for our idealized simulations and use it to understand how changes in tropical ascent area and the strength of the mean circulation relate to changes in heating in the ascending and descending regions. We show that the decrease in the strength of the mean circulation can be explained by the relatively slow rate at which atmospheric radiative cooling intensifies with warming. In our simulations, decreases in tropical ascent area are balanced by increases in nonradiative heating in convective regions. Consistent with previous work, we find a warming-induced decrease in the mean convective mass flux. However, when we condition by the sign of the mean vertical motion, the warming-induced changes in the convective mass flux are nonmonotonic and opposite between the ascending and descending regions.},

Here, using a climate model nudged to observed pan-tropical sea surface temperatures (SST), we show that the back-to-back La Ni\~na events during 2010\textendash 2011, followed by a North Pacific cooling and a marginal El Ni\~no, were a key contribution to the 2012 record low. Specifically, the La Ni\~na events in 2010\textendash 2011 warmed the Arctic Pacific sector, whereas tropical SST anomalies in 2012 strengthened the Greenland high pressure, leading to an Arctic dipole-like pressure pattern and strengthening of transpolar ice drift. These Arctic temperature and circulation anomalies led to the record low sea ice extent in 2012, highlighting the strong influence of tropical SSTs on Arctic climate.},

Focusing on the H2O amount and transport from UT to LS, we show that all reanalyses overestimate annual global mean UT H2O by up to 150\% compared to MLS observations. Substantial differences in H2O transport are also found between the observations and reanalyses. Vertically, H2O transport across the tropical tropopause (16\textendash 20 km) in the reanalyses is faster by up to 86\% compared to MLS observations. In the tropical LS (21\textendash 25 km), the mean vertical transport from ECMWF is 168\% faster than the MLS estimate, while MERRA and MERRA2 have vertical transport velocities within 10\% of MLS values. Horizontally at 100 hPa, both observation and reanalyses show faster poleward transport in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Compared to MLS observations, the H2O horizontal transport for both MERRA and MERRA2 is 106\% faster in the NH but about 42\textendash 45\% slower in the SH. ECMWF horizontal transport is 16\% faster than MLS observations in both hemispheres. The ratio of northward to southward transport velocities for ECMWF is 1.4, which agrees with MLS observation, while the corresponding ratios for MERRA and MERRA2 are about 3.5 times larger.},

The results also suggest that nearly half of the total summer mean rainfall over this region is associated with these propagating convection systems. For instance, the extreme wet condition of the 1993 summer may be attributed to the frequent occurrence of propagating convection events and enhanced diurnal rainfall amplitude over the Great Plains. Thus, proper representation of this important propagating component in GCMs is essential for simulating the diurnal and seasonal mean characteristics of summertime rainfall over the central US.},

Typical EN-like drought conditions were observed only in eastern Amazonia, whilst in western Amazonia there was an unusual wetting. We attribute this wet-dry dipole to the location of the maximum sea surface warming on the Central equatorial Pacific. The impacts of this climate extreme on the rainforest ecosystems remain to be documented and are likely to be different to previous strong EN events.},

First, all gridded data (from the U.S. Historical Weather Map series) for the Arctic Ocean area away from the North Atlantic sector appears to be between 4 and 6 mb too high before about 1931. The semi-permanent Arctic high produced in the early historical map series was the result of a lack of basic station data, and the belief amongst many North American meteorologists of the 1920s and 1930s of the existence of a polar or glacial anticyclone. The second error affects only north-western North America for the years 1899\textendash 1909. Here pressure is again too high compared with reconstructed data. The cause of this error is not immediately apparent, but is probably the result of an erroneous correction to sea level for stations in the region. Both errors seriously affect the homogeneity of the gridded Arctic series. The objective scheme used to reveal the errors, can also be used to derive correction factors for the gridded data prior to 1931.},

Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) enable systematic and robust analysis of results across many models, by reducing the influence of ad hoc differences in model set-up or experimental boundary conditions. As it enters its 6th phase, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) has grown significantly in scope with the design and documentation of individual simulations delegated to individual climate science communities. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The Coupled Climate\textendash Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP) takes responsibility for design, documentation, and analysis of carbon cycle feedbacks and interactions in climate simulations. These feedbacks are potentially large and play a leading-order contribution in determining the atmospheric composition in response to human emissions of CO\textsubscript{2} and in the setting of emissions targets to stabilize climate or avoid dangerous climate change. For over a decade, C4MIP has coordinated coupled climate\textendash carbon cycle simulations, and in this paper we describe the C4MIP simulations that will be formally part of CMIP6. While the climate\textendash carbon cycle community has created this experimental design, the simulations also fit within the wider CMIP activity, conform to some common standards including documentation and diagnostic requests, and are designed to complement the CMIP core experiments known as the Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK). {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} C4MIP has three key strands of scientific motivation and the requested simulations are designed to satisfy their needs: (1) pre-industrial and historical simulations (formally part of the common set of CMIP6 experiments) to enable model evaluation, (2) idealized coupled and partially coupled simulations with 1 \% per year increases in CO\textsubscript{2} to enable diagnosis of feedback strength and its components, (3) future scenario simulations to project how the Earth system will respond to anthropogenic activity over the 21st century and beyond. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} This paper documents in detail these simulations, explains their rationale and planned analysis, and describes how to set up and run the simulations. Particular attention is paid to boundary conditions, input data, and requested output diagnostics. It is important that modelling groups participating in C4MIP adhere as closely as possible to this experimental design.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we provide new surface-exposure ages from an outlet of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that reveal rapid glacier thinning occurred approximately 7,000 years ago, in the absence of large environmental changes. Glacier thinning persisted for more than two and a half centuries, resulting in hundreds of metres of ice loss. Numerical simulations indicate that ice surface drawdown accelerated when the otherwise steadily retreating glacier encountered a bedrock trough. Together, the geological reconstruction and numerical simulations suggest that centennial-scale glacier thinning arose from unstable grounding line retreat. Capturing these instability processes in ice sheet models is important for predicting Antarctica's future contribution to sea level change.},

This ``zero emissions commitment'' (ZEC) is also an important quantity when estimating the remaining carbon budget \textendash{} a limit on the total amount of CO\textsubscript{2} emissions consistent with limiting global mean temperature at a particular level. In the recent IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\&thinsp;\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}}C, the carbon budget framework used to calculate the remaining carbon budget for 1.5\&thinsp;\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}}C included the assumption that the ZEC due to CO\textsubscript{2} emissions is negligible and close to zero. Previous research has shown significant uncertainty even in the sign of the ZEC. To close this knowledge gap, we propose the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP), which will quantify the amount of unrealized temperature change that occurs after CO\textsubscript{2} emissions cease and investigate the geophysical drivers behind this climate response. Quantitative information on ZEC is a key gap in our knowledge, and one that will not be addressed by currently planned CMIP6 simulations, yet it is crucial for verifying whether carbon budgets need to be adjusted to account for any unrealized temperature change resulting from past CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. We request only one top-priority simulation from comprehensive general circulation Earth system models (ESMs) and Earth system models of intermediate complexity (EMICs) \textendash{} a branch from the 1\&thinsp;\% CO\textsubscript{2} run with CO\textsubscript{2} emissions set to zero at the point of 1000\&thinsp;PgC of total CO\textsubscript{2} emissions in the simulation \textendash{} with the possibility for additional simulations, if resources allow.

  abstract = {The land/sea warming contrast is a phenomenon of both equilibrium and transient simulations of climate change: large areas of the land surface at most latitudes undergo temperature changes whose amplitude is more than those of the surrounding oceans. Using idealised GCM experiments with perturbed SSTs, we show that the land/sea contrast in equilibrium simulations is associated with local feedbacks and the hydrological cycle over land, rather than with externally imposed radiative forcing. This mechanism also explains a large component of the land/sea contrast in transient simulations as well. We propose a conceptual model with three elements: (1) there is a spatially variable level in the lower troposphere at which temperature change is the same over land and sea; (2) the dependence of lapse rate on moisture and temperature causes different changes in lapse rate upon warming over land and sea, and hence a surface land/sea temperature contrast; (3) moisture convergence over land predominantly takes place at levels significantly colder than the surface; wherever moisture supply over land is limited, the increase of evaporation over land upon warming is limited, reducing the relative humidity in the boundary layer over land, and hence also enhancing the land/sea contrast. The non-linearity of the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relationship of saturation specific humidity to temperature is critical in (2) and (3). We examine the sensitivity of the land/sea contrast to model representations of different physical processes using a large ensemble of climate model integrations with perturbed parameters, and find that it is most sensitive to representation of large-scale cloud and stomatal closure. We discuss our results in the context of high-resolution and Earth-system modelling of climate change.},

Even though our general understanding of error growth and predictability has been increasing, relatively little is known about the detailed structure of atmospheric predictability, such as how it varies between climate regions. The present study addresses this issue by exploring error growth and predictability in three latitude zones, using model output from a previous global storm-resolving predictability experiment by Judt published in 2018. It was determined that the tropics have longer predictability than the middle latitudes and polar regions (tropics, \&gt;20 days; middle latitudes and polar regions, a little over 2 weeks). Each latitude zone had distinct error growth characteristics, and error growth was broadly consistent with the underlying dynamics of each zone. Evidence suggests that equatorial waves play a role in the comparatively long predictability of the tropics; specifically, equatorial waves seem to be less prone to error growth than middle-latitude baroclinic disturbances. Even though the generality of the findings needs to be assessed in future studies, the overall conclusions agree with previous work in that current numerical weather prediction procedures have not reached the limits of atmospheric predictability, especially in the tropics. One way to exploit tropical predictability is to reduce model error, for example, by using global storm-resolving models instead of conventional models that parameterize convection.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Simulations are performed with a ``two-way nesting'' system coupling interactively the regional and global versions of the LMDZ4 atmospheric general circulation model. At regional scale, the simulations confirm previous studies, showing that both the Andes and the Brazilian Plateau exert a control on the position and strength of the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ), mainly through their impact on the low-level jet and the coastal branch of the subtropical anticyclones. The northern topography of South America appears to be crucial to determine the leading mode of rainfall variability in eastern South America, which manifests itself as a dipole-like pattern between Southeastern South America and the SACZ region. The suppression of South America orography also shows global-scale effects, corresponding to an adjustment of the global circulation system. Changes in atmospheric circulation and precipitation are found in remote areas on the globe, being the consequences of various teleconnection mechanisms. When the Brazilian Plateau and the Andes are suppressed, there is a decrease of precipitation in the SACZ region, associated with a weakening of the large-scale ascendance. Changes are described in terms of anomalies in the Walker circulation, meridional displacements of the mid-latitude jet stream, Southern annular mode anomalies and modifications of Rossby wave train teleconnection processes.},

In particular we aim to better understand the combination of the local and regional mechanisms controlling the diurnal cycle of summertime (DJF) precipitation in the Northern Central Andes (NCA) region of Southern Peru. A climatology of the diurnal cycle is obtained from 15 wet seasons (2000\textendash 2014) of 3-hourly TRMM-3B42 data (0.25\textdegree\,\texttimes\,0.25\textdegree ) and swath data from the TRMM-2A25 precipitation radar product (5~km\,\texttimes\,5~km). The main findings are: (1) in the NCA region, the diurnal cycle shows a maximum precipitation occurring during the day (night) in the western (eastern) side of the Andes highlands, (2) in the valleys of the Cuzco region and in the Amazon slope of the Andes the maximum (minimum) precipitation occurs during the night (day). The WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) regional atmospheric model is used to simulate the mean diurnal cycle in the NCA region for the same period at 27~km and 9~km horizontal grid spacing and 3-hourly output, and at 3~km only for the month of January 2010 in the Cuzco valleys. Sensitivity experiments were also performed to investigate the effect of the topography on the observed rainfall patterns. The model reproduces the main diurnal precipitation features. The main atmospheric processes identified are: (1) the presence of a regional-scale cyclonic circulation strengthening during the afternoon, (2) diurnal thermally driven circulations at local scale, including upslope (downslope) wind and moisture transport during the day (night), (3) channelization of the upslope moisture transport from the Amazon along the Apurimac valleys toward the western part of the cordillera.},

Two cases of practical interest have been considered. The first is the effect of radiative heating upon tropospheric temperature inversions. It is concluded, in agreement with the results of Staley, that radiative heating acts to strengthen the inversion when water vapor mixing ratios within the inversion layer are small. The second case studied the consequences of the presence of substantial quantities of water vapor in the stratosphere. Cooling rates ranging up to 2.5\textdegree{} C. day-1 were obtained over a winter cross section of the Northern Hemisphere having a constant relative humidity of 5 perccnt in the stratosphere. Decreases in the net radiative flux, as evidenced by small heating rates in the region of the tropopause at low latitudes, agree with observations by Riehl in the Caribbean and by Kuhn and Suomi in the United States. The fact that this effect was not present when mixing ratios were allowed to decrease rapidly above the tropopause lends support to the argument that substantial quantities of water vapor are present in the stratosphere.},

Based on different climate simulations of the present day (CTR) and conducted with distinct Antarctic ice sheet topography (AIS-EXP), it is found that the reduction of the Antarctic ice sheet topography (AIS) induces warming of the Southern Hemisphere and reduces the meridional thermal gradient. Consequently, the atmospheric transient low level eddy heat flux \$\$[(\textbackslash overline\{v\^\{\textbackslash prime\}T\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\})]\$\$and the eddy momentum flux \$\$[(\textbackslash overline\{u\^\{\textbackslash prime\}v\^\{\textbackslash prime\}\})]\$\$are reduced causing the reduced transport of heat from the mid-latitudes to the pole. The stationary flow and transient wave anomalies generate changes in the SSTs which modify the rate of deep water formation, strengthening the formation of the Antarctic Bottom Water. Substantial changes are predicted to occur in the atmospheric and oceanic heat transport and a comparison between the total heat transport of the atmosphere-ocean system, as simulated by the AIS-EXP and the CTR runs, shows that the reduction of the AIS height leads to reduced Southern Hemisphere poleward and increased equatorward heat transport. These results are in agreement with reduced storm track activities and baroclinicity.},

The mid-Pliocene Warm Period experiment is part of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP) \textendash{} Phase 2, detailed in Haywood et al. (2016).{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}The goal of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP) is to understand the response of the climate system to different climate forcings for documented climatic states very different from the present and historical climates. Through comparison with observations of the environmental impact of these climate changes, or with climate reconstructions based on physical, chemical, or biological records, PMIP also addresses the issue of how well state-of-the-art numerical models simulate climate change. Climate models are usually developed using the present and historical climates as references, but climate projections show that future climates will lie well outside these conditions. Palaeoclimates very different from these reference states therefore provide stringent tests for state-of-the-art models and a way to assess whether their sensitivity to forcings is compatible with palaeoclimatic evidence. Simulations of five different periods have been designed to address the objectives of the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6): the millennium prior to the industrial epoch (CMIP6 name: \emph{past1000}); the mid-Holocene, 6000 years ago (\emph{midHolocene}); the Last Glacial Maximum, 21 000 years ago (\emph{lgm}); the Last Interglacial, 127 000 years ago (\emph{lig127k}); and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period, 3.2 million years ago (\emph{midPliocene-eoi400}).

It is under question whether different forcing agents perturb the global climate in a distinct way. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of similar climate response patterns in response to aerosol and greenhouse gas (GHG) forcings. In this study, the sensitivity of tropospheric temperature response patterns to surface heating distributions is assessed by forcing an atmospheric general circulation model coupled to an aquaplanet slab ocean with a wide range of possible forcing patterns. We show that a common climate pattern emerges in response to localized forcing at different locations. This pattern, characterized by enhanced warming in the tropical upper troposphere and the polar lower troposphere, resembles the historical trends from observations and models as well as the future projections. Atmospheric dynamics in combination with thermodynamic air-sea coupling are primarily responsible for shaping this pattern. Identifying this common pattern strengthens our confidence in the projected response to GHG and aerosols in complex climate models.},

An atmospheric model coupled to an aquaplanet slab mixed layer ocean is perturbed by prescribing heating to the ocean mixed layer. The heating is distributed uniformly globally or confined to narrow tropical or polar bands, and the amplitude is adjusted to ensure that the global mean remains the same for all cases. Since the tropical temperature is close to a moist adiabat, the prescribed heating leads to a maximized warming near the tropopause, whereas the polar warming is trapped near the surface because of strong atmospheric stability. Hence, the surface warming is more effectively damped by radiation in the tropics than in the polar region. As a result, the global surface temperature increase is weak (strong) when the given amount of heating is confined to the tropical (polar) band. The degree of this contrast is shown to depend on water vapor\textendash{} and cloud\textendash radiative feedbacks that alter the effective strength of prescribed thermal forcing.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In the climatological state, the summer cell reaches higher latitudes than the winter cell since the Hadley cell in summer deviates more from the angular momentum conserving state, resulting in weaker upper-level zonal winds, which enables the Hadley cell to extend farther poleward before becoming baroclinically unstable. The Hadley cell can also reach farther poleward as the ITCZ gets farther away from the equator; hence, the Hadley cell extends farther poleward in solstices than in equinoxes. In terms of trend, a robust poleward expansion of the Hadley cell is diagnosed in all seasons with global warming. The scaling analysis indicates this is mostly due to an increase in the subtropical static stability, which pushes poleward the baroclinically unstable zone and hence the poleward edge of the Hadley cell. The relation between the trends in the Hadley cell edge and the ITCZ is also discussed.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Intense tropical rainfall occurs in a narrow belt near the equator, called the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ). In the past decade, the atmospheric energy budget has been used to explain changes in the zonal-mean ITCZ position. The energetics framework provides a mechanism for extratropics-to-tropics teleconnections, which have been postulated from paleoclimate records. In atmosphere models coupled with a motionless slab ocean, the ITCZ shifts toward the warmed hemisphere in order for the Hadley circulation to transport energy toward the colder hemisphere. However, recent studies using fully coupled models show that tropical rainfall can be rather insensitive to extratropical forcing when ocean dynamics is included. Here, we explore the effect of meridional Ekman heat advection while neglecting the upwelling effect on the ITCZ response to prescribed extratropical thermal forcing. The tropical component of Ekman advection is a negative feedback that partially compensates the prescribed forcing, whereas the extratropical component is a positive feedback that amplifies the prescribed forcing. Overall, the tropical negative feedback dominates over the extratropical positive feedback. Thus, including Ekman advection reduces the need for atmospheric energy transport, dampening the ITCZ response. We propose to build a hierarchy of ocean models to systematically explore the full dynamical response of the coupled climate system.},

In both climate models and observations, the subtropical moistening is linked to a poleward shift of the extratropical westerly jet. Our results highlight the importance of polar regions for the subtropical hydrological cycle.

Two models are considered with differing surface flux formulations and in each case solutions that are symmetric about the equator are perturbed to create interhemispheric asymmetry. When SSTs are prescribed in the two models with different flux formulations, the magnitude of tropical precipitation response to identical SST anomalies is significantly different, but the differences can be understood in terms of the altered surface fluxes. In contrast, when the net surface energy fluxes are constrained to be identical in mixed layer simulations of the two different models, the response of tropical precipitation to perturbations in the surface energy balance is very similar. Both perspectives predict qualitatively the same precipitation response, but the energy budget better predicts the magnitude of the precipitation response. Thus, we argue that the atmospheric energy budget, controlled in these experiments primarily by the surface energy budget, is more fundamental to the control of tropical precipitation than the SSTs, in these simulations with axisymmetric climates. We touch briefly on a complication in the interpretation of the model results due to the fact that fixed SST and slab-ocean versions of the model can produce different Hadley cell strengths for the same SSTs.},

As in earlier studies, tropical precipitation in response to high-latitude forcing is skewed toward the warmed hemisphere.

This sensitivity as well as the tropical precipitation response can be understood from a simple theory with two ingredients: the changes in poleward energy fluxes are predicted using a one-dimensional energy balance model and a measure of the ``total gross moist stability'' [{$\Delta<$}em{$>$}m{$<$}/em{$>$}, which is defined as the total (mean plus eddy) atmospheric energy transport per unit mass transport] of the model tropics converts the energy flux change into a mass flux and a moisture flux change. The idealized model produces a low level of compensation of about 25\% between the imposed oceanic flux and the resulting response in the atmospheric energy transport in the tropics regardless of the convection scheme parameter. Because Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model 2 (AM2) with prescribed clouds and water vapor exhibits a similarly low level of compensation, it is argued that roughly 25\% of the compensation is dynamically controlled through eddy energy fluxes. The sensitivity of the tropical response to the convection scheme in the idealized model results from different values of {$\Delta<$}em{$>$}m{$<$}/em{$>$}: smaller {$\Delta<$}em{$>$}m{$<$}/em{$>$} leads to larger tropical precipitation changes for the same response in the energy transport.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A strong year-to-year variability on top of this trend indicates that sea ice is sensitive to short-term climate fluctuations. Previous studies show that anomalous atmospheric conditions over the Arctic during spring and summer affect ice melt and the September sea ice extent (SIE). These conditions are characterized by clouds, humidity, and heat anomalies that all affect downwelling shortwave (SWD) and longwave (LWD) radiation to the surface. In general, positive LWD anomalies are associated with cloudy and humid conditions, whereas positive anomalies of SWD appear under clear-sky conditions. Here the effect of realistic anomalies of LWD and SWD on summer sea ice is investigated by performing experiments with the Community Earth System Model. The SWD and LWD anomalies are studied separately and in combination for different seasons. It is found that positive LWD anomalies in spring and early summer have significant impact on the September SIE, whereas winter anomalies show only little effect. Positive anomalies in spring and early summer initiate an earlier melt onset, hereby triggering several feedback mechanisms that amplify melt during the succeeding months. Realistic positive SWD anomalies appear only important if they occur after the melt has started and the albedo is significantly reduced relative to winter conditions. Simulations where both positive LWD and negative SWD anomalies are implemented simultaneously, mimicking cloudy conditions, reveal that clouds during spring have a significant impact on summer sea ice while summer clouds have almost no effect.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

There are several indirect circulations, particularly the Deacon cell in the Southern Ocean and the Ferrel cells in the mid-latitude atmosphere, which appear to act against the mean density-gradient in regions of no apparent mean density-forcing. When the zonal-mean circulation is calculated in density coordinates, both the Deacon cell and the Ferrel cells disappear. A transformation of the zonal-mean circulation as a function of height is used to give the residual mean circulation, which is remarkably similar to the zonal-mean circulation in density coordinates in both the Southern Ocean and the atmosphere. This shows that the existence of the Deacon and Ferrel cells is the result of correlations of zonal variations of density and meridional flow, and not of zonal-mean density-forcing. Zonal variations associated with the time-mean eddies in the Southern Ocean are the main contributors to the Deacon cell, while correlations in transient weather systems are the major factor leading to Ferrel cells.},

  abstract = {Abstract Transient and stationary eddies shape the extratropical climate through their transport of heat, moisture, and momentum. In the zonal mean, the transports by transient eddies dominate over those by stationary eddies, but this is not necessarily the case locally. In particular, in storm-track entrance and exit regions during winter, stationary eddies and their interactions with the mean flow dominate the atmospheric energy transport. Here it is shown that stationary eddies can shape storm tracks and control where they terminate by modifying local baroclinicity. Simulations with an idealized aquaplanet GCM show that zonally localized surface heating alone (e.g., ocean heat flux convergence) gives rise to storm tracks, which have a well-defined length scale that is similar to that of Earth's storm tracks. The storm tracks terminate downstream of the surface heating even in the absence of continents, at a distance controlled by the stationary Rossby wavelength scale. Stationary eddies play a dual role: within about half a Rossby wavelength downstream of the heating region, stationary eddy energy fluxes increase the baroclinicity and therefore contribute to energizing the storm track; farther downstream, enhanced poleward and upward energy transport by stationary eddies reduces the baroclinicity by reducing the meridional temperature gradients and enhancing the static stability. Transports both of sensible and latent heat (water vapor) play important roles in determining where storm tracks terminate.},

The algorithm forces computed top-of-atmosphere (TOA) irradiances to match with Ed4 EBAF-TOA irradiances by adjusting surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties. Surface irradiances are subsequently adjusted using radiative kernels. The adjustment process is composed of two parts: bias correction and Lagrange multiplier. The bias in temperature and specific humidity between 200 and 500 hPa used for the irradiance computation is corrected based on observations by Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Similarly, the bias in the cloud fraction is corrected based on observations by Cloud\textendash Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and CloudSat. Remaining errors in surface, cloud, and atmospheric properties are corrected in the Lagrange multiplier process. Ed4 global annual mean (January 2005 through December 2014) surface net shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) irradiances increase by 1.3 W m-2 and decrease by 0.2 W m-2, respectively, compared to EBAF Edition 2.8 (Ed2.8) counterparts (the previous version), resulting in an increase in net SW + LW surface irradiance of 1.1 W m-2. The uncertainty in surface irradiances over ocean, land, and polar regions at various spatial scales are estimated. The uncertainties in all-sky global annual mean upward and downward shortwave irradiance are 3 and 4 W m-2, respectively, and the uncertainties in upward and downward longwave irradiance are 3 and 6 W m-2, respectively. With an assumption of all errors being independent, the uncertainty in the global annual mean surface LW + SW net irradiance is 8 W m-2.},

The Som palaeopycnometry method estimates an upper limit on ancient atmospheric density based on the size of lithified raindrop imprints preserved in ancient strata, with the assumption that the largest imprint was made by the largest possible raindrop. Using this technique Som et al. (2012) proposed a constraint on Archean atmospheric density of less than 2.3 kgm-3. Applying this method to modern raindrop imprints, the upper bound on surface density produced is 0.9 kgm-3, lower than the actual value of 1.2 kgm-3, refuting the method. We propose several changes to the method, the most important of which is increasing the maximum possible drop size from 6.8 to 10 mm to be consistent with new large datasets of raindrop observations. With these changes, our upper bound on modern surface density becomes 2.7 kgm-3, a valid limit. The upper bound on Archean atmospheric density is then revised to 11.1 kgm-3. In general, we find that raindrop imprint size distribution depends much more strongly on rainfall rate than atmospheric density, which translates into large errors. At best, the precision of raindrop palaeopycnometry will be a factor of a few to an order of magnitude.},

This study combines unique satellite observations with complementary data sets to document Arctic cloud and atmospheric structure during summer and early fall. The analysis focuses on 2006\textendash 2008, a period over which ice extent plummeted to record levels, substantial variability in atmospheric circulation patterns occurred, and spaceborne radar and lidar observations of vertical cloud structure became available. The observations show that large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, near-surface static stability, and surface conditions control Arctic cloud cover during the melt season. While no summer cloud response to sea ice loss was found, low clouds did form over newly open water during early fall. This seasonal variation in the cloud response to sea ice loss can be explained by near-surface static stability and air-sea temperature gradients. During summer, temperature inversions and weak air-sea temperature gradients limit atmosphere-ocean coupling. In contrast, relatively low static stability and strong air-sea gradients during early fall permit upward turbulent fluxes of moisture and heat and increased low cloud formation over newly open water. Because of their seasonal timing, cloud changes resulting from sea ice loss play a minor role in regulating ice-albedo feedbacks during summer, but may contribute to a cloud-ice feedback during early fall.},

  abstract = {Abstract Several recent studies diagnose lateral stirring and mixing in the upper ocean using altimetry-derived velocity fields to advect ``virtual'' particles and fields offline. However, the limited spatiotemporal resolution of altimetric maps leads to errors in the inferred diagnostics, because unresolved scales are necessarily imperfectly modeled. The authors examine a range of tracer diagnostics in two models of baroclinic turbulence: the standard Phillips model, in which dispersion is controlled by large-scale eddies, and the Eady model, where dispersion is determined by local scales of motion. These models serve as a useful best- and worst-case comparison and a valuable test of the resolution sensitivity of tracer diagnostics. The effect of unresolved scales is studied by advecting tracers using model velocity fields subsampled in space and time and comparing the derived tracer diagnostics with their ``true'' value obtained from the fully resolved flow. The authors find that eddy diffusivity and absolute dispersion, which are governed by large-scale dynamics, are insensitive to spatial sampling error in either flow. Measures that depend strongly on small scales, such as relative dispersion and finite-time Lyapunov exponents, are highly sensitive to spatial sampling in the Eady model. Temporal sampling error is found to have a more complicated behavior because of the onset of particle overshoot leading to scrambling of Lagrangian diagnostics. This leads to a potential restriction on the utility of raw altimetry maps for studying mixing in the upper ocean. The authors conclude that offline diagnostics of mixing in ocean flows with an energized submesoscale should be viewed with some caution.},

  abstract = {Abstract Attempts to monitor ocean eddy heat transport are strongly limited by the sparseness of available observations and the fact that heat transport is a quadratic, sign-indefinite quantity that is particularly sensitive to unresolved scales. In this article, a suite of stochastic filtering strategies for estimating eddy heat transport are tested in idealized two-layer simulations of mesoscale oceanic turbulence at high and low latitudes under a range of observation scenarios. A novel feature of these filtering strategies is the use of computationally inexpensive stochastic models to forecast the underlying nonlinear dynamics. The stochastic model parameters can be estimated by regression fitting to climatological energy spectra and correlation times or by adaptively learning these parameters ``on-the-fly'' from the observations themselves. The authors show that, by extracting high-wavenumber information that has been aliased into the low wavenumber band, ``stochastically super-resolved'' velocity fields with a nominal resolution increase of a factor of 2 or more can be derived. Observations of the upper-layer streamfunction are projected onto an empirical orthogonal function basis for the vertical structure to produce filtered estimates for both upper- and lower-layer streamfunctions and hence net heat transport. The resulting time-mean poleward eddy heat transport is significantly closer to the true value when compared with standard estimates based upon optimal interpolation. By contrast, the temporal variability of the heat transport is underestimated because of poor temporal resolution. Implications for estimating poleward eddy heat transport using current and next-generation altimeters are discussed.},

The central Arctic Basin is a region of cyclonic frequency equivalent to any place in the Northern Hemisphere outside of the semipermanent centers of action. In the mean, cyclones are warm in the troposphere because most of them enter the Arctic from over the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Cyclones which originate in the Arctic are cold-core. Anticyclones, in the mean, are colder than cyclones. However, their centers are usually capped by slightly warmer air, from the oceanic ridges, than is present over their peripheries.},

The RCE simulations, used as an idealization for the mean tropical climate, are run for a wide range of prescribed sea-surface temperatures (SSTs), from 21oC to 36oC, representing the range of past, present, and, possibly, future mean tropical SSTs. The RCE with constant Coriolis parameter f is contrasted with nonrotating RCE. The Coriolis parameter is artificially increased from typical values in the Tropics by about one order of magnitude to allow multiple tropical cyclones (TCs) to coexist in a relatively small 2300 \texttimes{} 2300 km2 domain with a 3 km horizontal grid spacing. Nonrotating RCE is also simulated, but using a substantially smaller, 384 \texttimes{} 384 km2 domain. Rotating RCE, which we nickname ``TC World,'' contains from 8 to 26 TCs with the average number of TCs monotonically decreasing with increasing SST. At the same time, the TCs' size, intensity, and per-TC precipitation rate tend to increase in response to increasing SST. For example, the average per-TC kinetic energy and precipitation rate tend to double for every 6oC SST increase. These results are consistent with scaling laws in which TC velocities and inner core diameters scale with the potential intensity and its ratio to the Coriolis parameter, respectively, while the separation between cyclone centers appears to scale with the deformation radius. It is also found that the outflow temperature of TC's, as defined as the height of the local maximum of the upper-troposphere cloud fraction, remains relatively invariant with SST. The cold-point tropopause height in TC World is found to be about 2 km higher than the corresponding height in nonrotating RCE.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Extreme convective events in the troposphere not only have immediate impacts on the surface, but they can also influence the dynamics and composition of the lower stratosphere (LS). One major impact is the moistening of the LS by overshooting convection. This effect plays a crucial role in climate feedback, as small changes of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) have a large impact on the radiative budget of the atmosphere. In this case study, we investigate water vapor injections into the LS by two consecutive convective events in the European mid-latitudes within the framework of the MOSES (Modular Observation Solutions for Earth Systems) measurement campaign during the early summer of 2019. Using balloon-borne instruments, measurements of convective water vapor injection into the stratosphere were performed. Such measurements with a high vertical resolution are rare. The magnitude of the stratospheric water vapor reached up to 12.1 ppmv (parts per million by volume), with an estimated background value of 5 ppmv. Hence, the water vapor enhancement reported here is of the same order of magnitude as earlier reports of water vapor injection by convective overshooting over North America. However, the overshooting took place in the extratropical stratosphere over Europe and has a stronger impact on long-term water vapor mixing ratios in the stratosphere compared to the monsoon-influenced region in North America. At the altitude of the measured injection, a sharp drop in a local ozone enhancement peak makes the observed composition of air very unique with high ozone up to 650 ppbv (parts per billion by volume) and high water vapor up to 12.1 ppmv. ERA-Interim does not show any signal of the convective overshoot, the water vapor values measured by the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) in the LS are lower than the in situ observations, and the ERA5 overestimated water vapor mixing ratios. Backward trajectories of the measured injected air masses reveal that the moistening of the LS took place several hours before the balloon launch. This is in good agreement with the reanalyses, which shows a strong change in the structure of isotherms and a sudden and short-lived increase in potential vorticity at the altitude and location of the trajectory. Similarly, satellite data show low cloud-top brightness temperatures during the overshooting event, which indicates an elevated cloud top height.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

It is shown that there is genuine hemispheric symmetry in the variation of the zonal wind in the Southern Hemisphere but not the Northern Hemisphere. The annular mode is shown to be baroclinic in nature; it is associated with changes in the baroclinic eddy source latitude, and the latitude of the eddy source region is organized by the mean flow. This behavior is expected if there is a baroclinic feedback that encourages the maximum baroclinic instability to be coincident with the maximum zonal wind speed, and discourages the meridional vacillation of the eddy-driven jet stream. It is shown that the strength of the thermally indirect circulation that gives rise to the baroclinic feedback appears to influence the time scale of the annular mode. When the thermally indirect circulation is stronger the annular mode has a longer e-folding time in a simplified GCM. Preliminary results indicate that the same dynamics are important in the real atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to put forward a new estimate, in the context of previous assessments, of the annual global mean energy budget. A description is provided of the source of each component to this budget. The top-of-atmosphere shortwave and longwave flux of energy is constrained by satellite observations. Partitioning of the radiative energy throughout the atmosphere is achieved through the use of detailed radiation models for both the longwave and shortwave spectral regions. Spectral features of shortwave and longwave fluxes at both the top and surface of the earth's system are presented. The longwave radiative forcing of the climate system for both clear (125 W m-2) and cloudy (155 W m-2) conditions are discussed. The authors find that for the clear sky case the contribution due to water vapor to the total longwave radiative forcing is 75 W m-2, while for carbon dioxide it is 32 W m-2. Clouds alter these values, and the effects of clouds on both the longwave and shortwave budget are addressed. In particular, the shielding effect by clouds on absorption and emission by water vapor is as large as the direct cloud forcing. Because the net surface heat budget must balance, the radiative fluxes constrain the sum of the sensible and latent heat fluxes, which can also be estimated independently.},

In the present study, monthly ERA-Interim reanalysis data are analyzed via cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function analysis to understand the seasonal mechanism of sea ice loss in the Arctic Ocean and the Arctic amplification. While sea ice loss is widespread over much of the perimeter of the Arctic Ocean in summer, sea ice remains thin in winter only in the Barents\textendash Kara seas. Excessive turbulent heat flux through the sea surface exposed to air due to sea ice reduction warms the atmospheric column. Warmer air increases the downward longwave radiation and subsequently surface air temperature, which facilitates sea surface remains to be free of ice. This positive feedback mechanism is not clearly observed in the Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas, since sea ice refreezes in late fall (November) before excessive turbulent heat flux is available for warming the atmospheric column in winter. A detailed seasonal heat budget is presented in order to understand specific differences between the Barents\textendash Kara seas and Laptev, East Siberian, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

During the Arctic winter, a variation of downward longwave radiation (DLR) is fundamental in modulating Arctic surface temperature. In the warm Arctic winter, DLR and precipitable water (PW) are increasing over the entire Arctic; however, the major drivers for such increases differ regionally. In areas such as the northern Greenland Sea, increasing DLR and PW are caused mainly by convergence of atmospheric energy transport from lower latitudes. In regions of maximum sea ice retreat (e.g., northern Barents\textendash Kara Seas), continued sea ice melting from previous seasons drive the DLR and PW increases, consistent with the positive ice\textendash insulation feedback. Distinct local feedbacks between open water and ice-retreat regions were further compared. In open water regions, a reduced ocean\textendash atmosphere temperature gradient caused by atmospheric warming suppresses surface turbulent heat flux (THF) release from the ocean to the atmosphere; thus, surface warming cannot accelerate. Conversely, in ice-retreat regions, sea ice reduction allows the relatively warm ocean to interact with the colder atmosphere via surface THF release. This increases temperature and humidity in the lower troposphere consistent with the positive ice\textendash insulation feedback. The implication of this study is that Arctic warming will slow as the open water fraction increases. Therefore, given sustained greenhouse warming, the roles of atmospheric heat and moisture transport from lower latitudes are likely to become increasingly critical in the future Arctic climate.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Previous studies have shown that sea ice loss over the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) in early winter intensifies surface warming and favors more frequent Ural blocking (UB). Using three different blocking detection methods based on reanalysis and model simulation, we find that the increased occurrences of UB and Kamchatka blocking (KB) over Eurasia are concurrent with both the sea ice loss over the BKS and Eurasian cooling, emphasizing the synergic conditions of sea ice and atmospheric internal variability in facilitating the frequent blocking events. Under the sea ice loss and Eurasian cooling conditions, the KB manifests the strongest surface cold anomaly over Northern Eurasia. In contrast, the UB shows either the robust or slightly stronger cold anomaly over Eurasia depending on the conditions above. Consequently, the surface impacts of two regional blockings given the combined conditions of BKS sea ice loss and Eurasian cooling contribute the most to the amplified dipole pattern of Eurasian surface air temperature (SAT). The enhanced dipole pattern shows distinct similarities to the warm Arctic and cold Eurasia (WACE) pattern, previously defined as the second principal mode of winter SAT variability over Eurasia. This implies the role of sea ice loss in reinforcing the internal variability of Eurasian SAT via multiple blocking activities, triggering cold extremes toward Eurasia. Climate simulations with Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) can reproduce the observed linkage among sea ice, blocking, and the WACE pattern.},

As a result, the east\textendash west asymmetry in the tropical Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) decreases with increasing the Tokioka parameter. Accompanied with the reduced east\textendash west SST asymmetry are the increase of mean precipitation over the eastern Pacific and the eastward shift of the atmospheric responses to the ENSO-related SST forcing. The eastward shifted wind stress anomaly associated with ENSO leads to the stronger ENSO variability. In this way the magnitude of ENSO simulated in this model increases with the Tokioka parameter.

To identify the contributions of various feedback processes to the ENSO amplitude, we used the Bjerknes stability (BJ) index, which aims to quantify the main ENSO feedbacks from a linear perspective. To start, we demonstrated that the time-varying BJ index is highly correlated with the decadal changes in the standard deviation of the ENSO index, suggesting that it provides a good representation of the decadal modulation of the ENSO amplitude. We further revealed that this phenomenon can be attributed mainly to thermocline feedback changes, particularly changes in the oceanic response to zonal wind stress. In addition, two critical features of the background state were found to contribute significantly to changes in the equatorial thermocline feedback: 1) the subtropical\textendash tropical cells and 2) ocean stratification. It was suggested that weak (strong) background subtropical meridional overturning circulation partly contributes to regulating the narrower (wider) meridional scales of the sea surface temperature and the associated zonal wind stress anomalies. The more stratified the ocean, the stronger ocean responses to a given wind stress forcing, which affects the ENSO amplitude.},

In particular, we examine the sensitivity of polar surface warming response under different insolation conditions from equinox (EQN) to annual mean (ANN) to seasonally varying (SEA). Varying insolation greatly affects the climatological static stability. The equinox condition, with the largest polar static stability, exhibits a bottom-heavy vertical profile of polar warming response that leads to the strongest polar amplification. In contrast, the polar warming response in ANN and SEA exhibits a maximum in the midtroposphere, which leads to only weak polar amplification. The midtropospheric warming maximum, which results from an increased poleward atmospheric energy transport in response to the tropics-to-pole energy imbalance, contributes to polar surface warming via downward clear-sky longwave radiation. However, it is cancelled by negative cloud radiative feedbacks locally. Furthermore, the polar lapse rate feedback, calculated from radiative kernels, is negative due to the midtropospheric warming maximum, and hence is not able to promote the polar surface warming. On the other hand, the polar lapse rate feedback in EQN is positive due to the bottom-heavy warming response, contributing to the strong polar surface warming. This contrast suggests that locally induced positive radiative feedbacks are necessary for strong polar amplification. Our results demonstrate how interactions among climate feedbacks determine the strength of polar amplification.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Here, by conducting observational analyses and model experiments, we show how Arctic sea-ice loss and cold winters in extra-polar regions are dynamically connected through the polar stratosphere. We find that decreased sea-ice cover during early winter months (November\textendash December), especially over the Barents\textendash Kara seas, enhances the upward propagation of planetary-scale waves with wavenumbers of 1 and 2, subsequently weakening the stratospheric polar vortex in mid-winter (January\textendash February).

The University of Wisconsin Probabilistic Downscaling (UWPD) dataset applies a ``probabilistic'' approach to downscaling that may be advantageous in a number of situations, including realistic representation of extreme events. The probabilistic approach to downscaling, however, presents some unique challenges for verification, especially when comparing a full probability density function with a single observed value for each day. Furthermore, because of the wide range of specific climatic information needed in climate impacts assessment, any single verification metric will be useful to only a limited set of practitioners. The intent of this study, then, is (i) to identify verification metrics appropriate for probabilistic downscaling of climate data; (ii) to apply, within the UWPD, those metrics to a suite of extreme event statistics that may be of use in climate impacts assessments; and (iii) in applying these metrics, to demonstrate the utility of a probabilistic approach to downscaling climate data, especially for representing extreme events.},

A probabilistic approach is used, predicting a daily-varying probability density function (PDF) of local-scale daily wind speed conditioned on large-scale daily wind speed predictors. Advantages of a probabilistic method are that it provides realistic information on the variance and extremes in addition to information on the mean, it allows the autocorrelation of downscaled realizations to be tuned to match the autocorrelation of local-scale observations, and it allows flexibility in the use of the final downscaled product. Much attention is given to fitting the proper functional form of the PDF by investigating the observed local-scale wind speed distribution (predictand) as a function of the decile of the large-scale wind (predictor). It is found that the local-scale standard deviation and the local-scale shape parameter (from a gamma distribution) are nonconstant functions of the large-scale predictor. As such, a vector generalized linear model is developed to relate the large-scale and local-scale wind speeds. Maximum likelihood and cross validation are used to fit local-scale gamma distribution shape and scale parameters to the large-scale wind speed. The result is a daily-varying probability distribution of local-scale wind speed, conditioned on the large-scale wind speed.},

  abstract = {The uncertainties surrounding global climate change provide ample evidence, if any were necessary, of the need for a whole-system view of the Earth. Arguably the most visible \textendash{} and controversial \textendash{} attempt to understand Earth as a system has been Lovelock's Gaia theory. Gaia has been a fruitful hypothesis generator, and has prompted many intriguing conjectures about how biological processes might contribute to planetary-scale regulation of atmospheric chemistry and climate. In many important cases, however, these conjectures are refuted by the available data. For example, Gaia theory predicts that the composition of the atmosphere should be tightly regulated by biological processes, but rates of carbon uptake into the biosphere have accelerated by only about 2\% in response to the 35\% rise in atmospheric CO2 since pre-industrial times. Gaia theory would predict that atmospheric CO2 should be more sensitively regulated by terrestrial ecosystem uptake (which is biologically mediated) than by ocean uptake (which is primarily abiotic), but both processes are about equally insensitive to atmospheric CO2 levels. Gaia theory predicts that biological feedbacks should make the Earth system less sensitive to perturbation, but the best available data suggest that the net effect of biologically mediated feedbacks will be to amplify, not reduce, the Earth system's sensitivity to anthropogenic climate change. Gaia theory predicts that biological by-products in the atmosphere should act as planetary climate regulators, but the Vostok ice core indicates that CO2, CH4, and dimethyl sulfide \textendash{} all biological by-products \textendash{} function to make the Earth warmer when it is warm, and colder when it is cold. Gaia theory predicts that biological feedbacks should regulate Earth's climate over the long term, but peaks in paleotemperature correspond to peaks in paleo-CO2 in records stretching back to the Permian; thus if CO2 is biologically regulated as part of a global thermostat, that thermostat has been hooked up backwards for at least the past 300 million years. Gaia theory predicts that organisms alter their environment to their own benefit, but throughout most of the surface ocean (comprising more than half of the globe), nutrient depletion by plankton has almost created a biological desert, and is kept in check only by the nutrient starvation of the plankton themselves. Lastly, where organisms enhance their environment for themselves, they create positive feedback; thus Gaia theory's two central principles \textendash{} first, that organisms stabilize their environment, and second, that organisms alter their environment in ways that benefit them \textendash{} are mutually inconsistent with one another. These examples suggest that the further development of Gaia theory will require more deliberate comparison of theory and data.},

  abstract = {Organisms can greatly affect their environments, and the feedback coupling between organisms and their environments can shape the evolution of both. Beyond these generally accepted facts, the Gaia hypothesis advances three central propositions: (1) that biologically mediated feedbacks contribute to environmental homeostasis, (2) that they make the environment more suitable for life, and (3) that such feedbacks should arise by Darwinian natural selection. These three propositions do not fare well under close scrutiny. (1) Biologically mediated feedbacks are not intrinsically homeostatic. Many of the biological mechanisms that affect global climate are destabilizing, and it is likely that the net effect of biological feedbacks will be to amplify, not dampen, global warming. (2) Nor do biologically mediated feedbacks necessarily enhance the environment, although it will often appear as if this were the case, simply because natural selection will favor organisms that do well in their environments \textendash{} which means doing wellunder the conditions that they and their co-occurring species have created. (3) Finally, Gaian feedbacks can evolve by natural selection, but so can anti-Gaian feedbacks. Daisyworld models evolve Gaian feedback because they assume that any trait that improves the environment will also give a reproductive advantage to its carriers (over other organisms that share the same environment). In the real world, by contrast, natural selection favors any trait that gives its carriers a reproductive advantage over its non-carriers, whether it improves or degrades the environment (and thereby benefits or hinders its carriers and non-carriers alike). Thus Gaian and anti-Gaian feedbacks are both likely to evolve.},

For the subgrid turbulence processes, a time-dependent turbulence energy equation is solved which depends on local buoyancy, shear and dissipation. First-order closure is applied to nearly conservative variables with eddy coefficients based on the computed turbulence energy. Open lateral boundaries are incorporated in the model that respond to internal forcing and permit gravity waves to propagate out of the integration domain with little apparent reflection. Microphysical processes are included in the model using a Kessler-type parameterization. Simulations conducted for an unsheared environment reveal that the updraft temperatures follow a moist adiabatic lapse rate and that the convection is dissipated by water loading of the updraft. The influence of a one-directional shear on the storm development is also investigated. A simulation with a veering and backing wind profile exhibits interesting features which include a double vortex circulation, cell splitting and, secondary cell formation.},

Observations are used to evaluate models, yet there is a debate about whether and how to explicitly weight model projections by agreement with observations. Here we present a straightforward weighting scheme that accounts both for the large differences in model performance and for model interdependencies, and we test reliability in a perfect model setup. We provide weighted multimodel projections of Arctic sea ice and temperature as a case study to demonstrate that, for some questions at least, it is meaningless to treat all models equally. The constrained ensemble shows reduced spread and a more rapid sea ice decline than the unweighted ensemble. We argue that the growing number of models with different characteristics and considerable interdependence finally justifies abandoning strict model democracy, and we provide guidance on when and how this can be achieved robustly.},

It covers the period from 1958, when regular radiosonde observations began on a global basis. JRA-55 is the first comprehensive reanalysis that has covered the last half-century since the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 45-year Reanalysis (ERA-40), and is the first one to apply four-dimensional variational analysis to this period. The main objectives of JRA-55 were to address issues found in previous reanalyses and to produce a comprehensive atmospheric dataset suitable for studying multidecadal variability and climate change. This paper describes the observations, data assimilation system, and forecast model used to produce JRA-55 as well as the basic characteristics of the JRA-55 product.{$\quad$}JRA-55 has been produced with the TL319 version of JMA's operational data assimilation system as of December 2009, which was extensively improved since the Japanese 25-year Reanalysis (JRA-25). It also uses several newly available and improved past observations. The resulting reanalysis products are considerably better than the JRA-25 product. Two major problems of JRA-25 were a cold bias in the lower stratosphere, which has been diminished, and a dry bias in the Amazon basin, which has been mitigated. The temporal consistency of temperature analysis has also been considerably improved compared to previous reanalysis products. Our initial quality evaluation revealed problems such as a warm bias in the upper troposphere, large upward imbalance in the global mean net energy fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface, excessive precipitation over the tropics, and unrealistic trends in analyzed tropical cyclone strength. This paper also assesses the impacts of model biases and changes in the observing system, and mentions efforts to further investigate the representation of low-frequency variability and trends in JRA-55.},

It entails identifying the occurrence of a jet event at a given location and then compiling the spatial frequency distribution of such events. The resulting climatology, derived using the ERA-15 reanalysis data set of the ECMWF for the period 1979\textendash 1993 indicates that (1) in both hemispheres the annual cycle of jet events takes the form of comparatively smooth transition from a quasi-annular structure in summer to a more spiral-like structure in winter with a temporally asymmetric return to the summer pattern; (2) the hemispheres differ primarily in the amplitude of the frequencies and the longitudinal overlap of the spiral portion of the pattern. In addition, the jet events are subdivided using a two-class typology comprising shallow and deep jets whose vertical shear (sic. baroclinicity) are/are not confined principally to the upper troposphere. This provides a conceptually simple and dynamically meaningful classification since deep jets are more likely to spawn tropospheric-spanning cyclones. The accompanying climatology displays important longitudinal variations and significant inter-hemispheric differences. A comparison is drawn between these new and conventional climatologies and typologies. Also, comments are proffered on the relationship between, on the one hand, the patterns of jet frequency including the differing distributions of the shallow and deep types and, on the other hand, the location of the time-mean jets and the downstream storm tracks.

This paper describes NICAM16-S, the latest stable version of NICAM (NICAM.16), modified for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, High Resolution Model Intercomparison Project (HighResMIP). Major updates of NICAM.12, a previous version used for climate simulations, included updates of the cloud microphysics scheme and land surface model, introduction of natural and anthropogenic aerosols and a subgrid-scale orographic gravity wave drag scheme, and improvement of the coupling between the cloud microphysics and the radiation schemes. External forcings were updated to follow the protocol of the HighResMIP. A series of short-term sensitivity experiments were performed to determine and understand the impacts of these various model updates on the simulated mean states. The NICAM16-S simulations demonstrated improvements in the ice water content, high cloud amount, surface air temperature over the Arctic region, location and strength of zonal mean subtropical jet, and shortwave radiation over Africa and South Asia. Some long-standing biases, such as the double intertropical convergence zone and smaller low cloud amount, still exist or are even worse in some cases, suggesting further necessity for understanding their mechanisms, upgrading schemes and parameter settings, and enhancing horizontal and vertical resolutions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Poleward and downward propagation of the zonal-mean zonal wind anomalies can be translated as rotation of state vector in a plane spanned by the two EOFs. Major SSWs occur in phase with the slowly propagating zonal wind anomalies, which implies a ``conditioning'' of the atmosphere by the slowly varying state. Movement of the state vector suggests quasi-periodicity of the order of 4 months, although generally only one cycle is achieved during a major warming winter. This characteristic feature can be compared to the stratospheric vacillation cycle in a mechanistic model. It is also shown that changes in the tropospheric planetary waves associated with the slowly propagating zonal wind anomalies coincide with changes in the Arctic Oscillation.},

Results of the coupled run forced by twentieth-century CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations show significant discrepancies during summer months with respect to observations of the spatial distribution of the ice concentration and ice thickness. Equally important, the coupled run lacks interannual variability in all ice and Arctic Ocean parameters. Causes for such big discrepancies arise from errors in the ECHAM5/MPI-OM atmosphere and associated errors in surface forcing fields (especially wind stress). This includes mean bias pattern caused by an artificial circulation around the geometric North Pole in its atmosphere, as well as insufficient atmospheric variability in the ECHAM5/MPI-OM model, for example, associated with Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO). In contrast, the identical coupled ocean\textendash ice model, when driven by NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis fields, shows much increased skill in its ice and ocean circulation parameters. However, common to both model runs is too strong an ice export through the Fram Strait and a substantially biased heat content in the interior of the Arctic Ocean, both of which may affect sea ice budgets in centennial projections of the Arctic climate system.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Next, we demonstrate that our predicted wind speeds match those from three-dimensional numerical simulations over a broad range of parameters. Finally, we use our theory to evaluate how well different drag mechanisms can match the wind speeds observed with Doppler spectroscopy for HD 189733b and HD 209458b. We find that magnetic drag is potentially too weak to match the observations for HD 189733b, but is compatible with the observations for HD 209458b. In contrast, shear instabilities and/or shocks are compatible with both observations. Furthermore, the two mechanisms predict different wind speed trends for hotter and colder planets than currently observed. As a result, we propose that a wider range of Doppler observations could reveal multiple drag mechanisms at play across different hot Jupiters.},

Linearity implies that radiative forcing has the same impact in warmer as in colder climates and is thus of fundamental importance for understanding past and future climate change. Although the evidence for a nearly linear relation was first pointed out more than 50 y ago, it is still unclear why this relation is valid and when it breaks down. Here we present a simple semianalytical model that explains Earth's linear OLR as an emergent property of an atmosphere whose greenhouse effect is dominated by a condensable gas. Linearity arises from a competition between the surface's increasing thermal emission and the narrowing of spectral window regions with warming and breaks down at high temperatures once continuum absorption cuts off spectral windows. Our model provides a way of understanding the longwave contribution to Earth's climate sensitivity and suggests that extrasolar planets with other condensable greenhouse gases could have climate dynamics similar to Earth's.},

Understanding these observations will require well-developed theory in addition to numerical simulations. Here we present theoretical models for the temperature structure and atmospheric circulation of dry, tidally locked rocky exoplanets with gray radiative transfer and test them using a general circulation model (GCM). First, we develop a radiative-convective (RC) model that captures surface temperatures of slowly rotating and cool atmospheres. Second, we show that the atmospheric circulation acts as a global heat engine, which places strong constraints on large-scale wind speeds. Third, we develop an RC-subsiding model which extends our RC model to hot and thin atmospheres. We find that rocky planets develop large day\textendash night temperature gradients at a ratio of wave-to-radiative timescales up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value suggested by work on hot Jupiters. The small ratio is due to the heat engine inefficiency and asymmetry between updrafts and subsidence in convecting atmospheres. Fourth, we show, using GCM simulations, that rotation only has a strong effect on temperature structure if the atmosphere is hot or thin. Our models let us map out atmospheric scenarios for planets such as GJ 1132b, and show how thermal phase curves could constrain them. Measuring phase curves of short-period planets will require similar amounts of time on the James Webb Space Telescope as detecting molecules via transit spectroscopy, so future observations should pursue both techniques.},

  abstract = {Polar lows are intense mesoscale cyclones that occur at high latitudes in both hemispheres during winter. Their sometimes evidently convective nature, fueled by strong surface fluxes and with cloud-free centers, have led to some polar lows being referred to as ``arctic hurricanes.'' Idealized studies have shown that intensification by hurricane development mechanisms is theoretically possible in polar winter atmospheres, but the lack of observations and realistic simulations of actual polar lows have made it difficult to ascertain if this occurs in reality. Here the roles of surface heat fluxes and latent heat release in the development of a Barents Sea polar low, which in its cloud structures showed some similarities to hurricanes, are studied with an ensemble of sensitivity experiments, where latent heating and/or surface fluxes of sensible and latent heat were switched off before the polar low peaked in intensity. To ensure that the polar lows in the sensitivity runs did not track too far away from the actual environmental conditions, a technique known as spectral nudging was applied. This was shown to be crucial for enabling comparisons between the different model runs. The results presented here show that (1) no intensification occurred during the mature, postbaroclinic stage of the simulated polar low; (2) surface heat fluxes, i.e., air-sea interaction, were crucial processes both in order to attain the polar low's peak intensity during the baroclinic stage and to maintain its strength in the mature stage; and (3) latent heat release played a less important role than surface fluxes in both stages.},

  abstract = {The recent detections of temperate terrestrial planets orbiting nearby stars and the promise of characterizing their atmospheres motivate a need to understand how the diversity of possible planetary parameters affects the climate of terrestrial planets. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and M dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the planetary rotation period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface gravity, planetary radius, and cloud particle size. We do so using a general circulation model (GCM) that includes nongray radiative transfer and the effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show qualitatively similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary parameters to idealized GCMs, with quantitative differences due to the inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that the effective cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the climate of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high dayside cloud coverage of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with increasing rotation period. We determine that this cloud transition is due to eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should not be parameterization dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from our simulations of planets orbiting M dwarf stars, finding that changing incident stellar flux and rotation period affect observable properties of terrestrial exoplanets. Our GCM results can guide expectations for planetary climate over the broad range of possible terrestrial exoplanets that will be observed with future space telescopes.},

Here, we present a three-dimensional model that explains this relationship, in order to provide insight into the processes that control heat redistribution in tidally locked planetary atmospheres. This three-dimensional model combines predictive analytic theory for the atmospheric circulation and dayside\textendash nightside temperature differences over a range of equilibrium temperatures, atmospheric compositions, and potential frictional drag strengths with numerical solutions of the circulation that verify this analytic theory. The theory shows that the longitudinal propagation of waves mediates dayside\textendash nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres, analogous to the wave adjustment mechanism that regulates the thermal structure in Earth's tropics. These waves can be damped in hot Jupiter atmospheres by either radiative cooling or potential frictional drag. This frictional drag would likely be caused by Lorentz forces in a partially ionized atmosphere threaded by a background magnetic field, and would increase in strength with increasing temperature. Additionally, the amplitude of radiative heating and cooling increases with increasing temperature, and hence both radiative heating/cooling and frictional drag damp waves more efficiently with increasing equilibrium temperature. Radiative heating and cooling play the largest role in controlling dayside\textendash nightside temperature differences in both our analytic theory and numerical simulations, with frictional drag only being important if it is stronger than the Coriolis force. As a result, dayside\textendash nightside temperature differences in hot Jupiter atmospheres increase with increasing stellar irradiation and decrease with increasing pressure.},

The analytic theory of Komacek \& Showman shows that this trend is due to the decreasing ability with increasing incident stellar flux of waves to propagate from day to night and erase temperature differences. Here, we compare the predictions of this theory with observations, showing that it explains well the shape of the trend of increasing dayside\textendash nightside temperature difference with increasing equilibrium temperature. Applied to individual planets, the theory matches well with observations at high equilibrium temperatures but, for a fixed photosphere pressure of , systematically underpredicts the dayside\textendash nightside brightness temperature differences at equilibrium temperatures less than . We interpret this as being due to the effects of a process that moves the infrared photospheres of these cooler hot Jupiters to lower pressures. We also utilize general circulation modeling with double-gray radiative transfer to explore how the circulation changes with equilibrium temperature and drag strengths. As expected from our theory, the dayside\textendash nightside temperature differences from our numerical simulations increase with increasing incident stellar flux and drag strengths. We calculate model phase curves using our general circulation models, from which we compare the broadband infrared offset from the substellar point and dayside\textendash nightside brightness temperature differences against observations, finding that strong drag or additional effects (e.g., clouds and/or supersolar metallicities) are necessary to explain many observed phase curves.},

Due to their large planet-to-star radius ratios and higher frequency of transits, terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars are favorable for transmission spectroscopy. In this work, we quantify the effect that water clouds have on the amplitude of water vapor transmission spectral features of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars. To do so, we make synthetic transmission spectra from general circulation model (GCM) experiments of tidally locked planets. We improve upon previous work by considering how varying a broad range of planetary parameters affects transmission spectra. We find that clouds lead to a 10\textendash 100 times increase in the number of transits required to detect water features with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with varying rotation period, incident stellar flux, surface pressure, planetary radius, and surface gravity. We also find that there is a strong increase in the dayside cloud coverage in our GCM simulations with rotation periods {$\greaterequivlnt$}12 days for planets with Earth's radius. This increase in cloud coverage leads to even stronger muting of spectral features for slowly rotating exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars. We predict that it will be extremely challenging to detect water transmission features in the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zone of M dwarf stars with JWST. However, species that are well-mixed above the cloud deck (e.g., CO2 and CH4) may still be detectable on these planets with JWST.},

The terrestrial exoplanets that will be characterized with future infrared space telescopes orbit M dwarf stars. As a result, the best observable terrestrial exoplanets have vastly different climates from Earth, with a large dayside-to-nightside irradiation contrast and relatively slow rotation. Hurricanes may affect future observations of terrestrial exoplanets because they enhance the vertical transport of water vapor and could influence ocean heat transport. In this work, we explore how the environment of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars affects the favorability of hurricane genesis (formation). To do so, we apply metrics developed to understand hurricane genesis on Earth to three-dimensional climate models of ocean-covered exoplanets orbiting M dwarf stars. We find that hurricane genesis is most favorable on intermediate-rotating tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with rotation periods of {$\sim$}8\textendash 10 days. As a result, hurricane genesis is most favorable for terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones of late-type M dwarf stars. The peak in the favorability of hurricane genesis at intermediate rotation occurs because sufficient spin is required for hurricane genesis, but the vertical wind shear on fast-rotating terrestrial exoplanets disrupts hurricane genesis. We find that hurricane genesis is less favorable on slowly rotating terrestrial exoplanets, which agrees with previous work. Future work using simulations that resolve hurricane genesis and evolution can test our expectations for how the environment affects the favorability of hurricane genesis on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets.},

Recent detections of reinflated warm Jupiters orbiting post-main-sequence stars and the reinflation of hot Jupiters while their host stars evolve on the main sequence may help constrain models for the anomalous radii of hot Jupiters. In this work, we present evolution models studying the reinflation of gas giants to determine how varying the depth and intensity of deposited heating affects both main-sequence reinflation of hot Jupiters and post-main-sequence reinflation of warm Jupiters. We find that deeper heating is required to reinflate hot Jupiters than is needed to suppress their cooling, and that the timescale of reinflation decreases with increasing heating rate and depth. We find a strong degeneracy between heating rate and depth, with either strong shallow heating or weak deep heating providing an explanation for main-sequence reinflation of hot Jupiters. This degeneracy between heating rate and depth can be broken in the case of post-main-sequence reinflation of warm Jupiters, as the inflation must be rapid to occur within post-main-sequence evolution timescales. We also show that the dependence of heating rate on the incident stellar flux inferred from the sample of hot Jupiters can explain reinflation of both warm and hot Jupiters. TESS will obtain a large sample of warm Jupiters orbiting post-main-sequence stars, which will help to constrain the mechanism(s) causing the anomalous radii of gas-giant planets.},

In this work, we derive a scaling theory for the equator-to-pole temperature contrast and bulk lapse rate of terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres. This theory is built on the work of Jansen \& Ferrari and determines how unstable the atmosphere is to baroclinic instability (the baroclinic ``criticality'') through a balance between the baroclinic eddy heat flux and radiative heating/cooling. We compare our scaling theory to General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations and find that the theoretical predictions for equator-to-pole temperature contrast and bulk lapse rate broadly agree with GCM experiments with varying rotation rate and surface pressure throughout the baroclincally unstable regime. Our theoretical results show that baroclinic instabilities are a strong control of heat transport in the atmospheres of Earth-like exoplanets, and our scalings can be used to estimate the equator-to-pole temperature contrast and bulk lapse rate of terrestrial exoplanets. These scalings can be tested by spectroscopic retrievals and full-phase light curves of terrestrial exoplanets with future space telescopes.},

A wide range of previous work has explored the climate of circumbinary planets with one-dimensional energy balance models, but studies utilizing three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) have only explored gaseous or ocean-covered planets. Recent GCM results from Wolf et al. (2020, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JE006576) determine the impact of the time-varying stellar forcing on the climate of Earth-like circumbinary planets in a broad range of 12 modeled systems with stellar spectral types from G2 to M0. The planets modeled are assumed to have the same continental and oceanic configuration as Earth and receive the same time-averaged stellar instellation as Earth. In all cases the climate variability has a low amplitude, with local maximum temperatures never exceeding the wet bulb threshold for human life. As a result, Earth-like life could persist on circumbinary planets that undergo large-amplitude orbital variations in instellation, and such planets remain viable targets to search for biosignatures and other key habitability indicators.},

Propagating waves and instabilities in hot Jupiter atmospheres can cause emergent properties of the atmosphere to be time-variable. In this work, we study such weather in hot Jupiter atmospheres using idealized cloud-free general circulation models with double-gray radiative transfer. We find that hot Jupiter atmospheres can be time-variable at the {$\sim$}0.1\%\textendash 1\% level in globally averaged temperature and at the {$\sim$}1\%\textendash 10\% level in globally averaged wind speeds. As a result, we find that observable quantities are also time-variable: the secondary eclipse depth can be variable at the {$\lessequivlnt$}2\% level, the phase-curve amplitude can change by {$\lessequivlnt$}1\%, the phase-curve offset can shift by {$\lessequivlnt$}5\textdegree, and terminator-averaged wind speeds can vary by {$\lessequivlnt$}2 km s-1. Additionally, we calculate how the eastern and western limb-averaged wind speeds vary with incident stellar flux and the strength of an imposed drag that parameterizes Lorentz forces in partially ionized atmospheres. We find that the eastern limb is blueshifted in models over a wide range of equilibrium temperature and drag strength, while the western limb is only redshifted if equilibrium temperatures are {$\lessequivlnt$}1500 K and drag is weak. Lastly, we show that temporal variability may be observationally detectable in the infrared through secondary eclipse observations with the James Webb Space Telescope, phase-curve observations with future space telescopes (e.g., ARIEL), and/or Doppler wind speed measurements with high-resolution spectrographs.},

A useful reduced model for geostrophic turbulence is barotropic (2D) turbulence. The focus of this study is on 2D    {$\beta$}   -plane turbulence with quadratic drag, which, although arguably the most realistic barotropic model of ocean turbulence, has remained unexplored thus far. We first review and test classical scaling arguments for the eddy diffusivity in three regimes: the strong friction limit, the weak friction/strong    {$\beta$}    limit, and a transition regime. We then develop a generalized theory by parameterizing the nonlinear eddy\textendash eddy interactions as a stochastic process, which leads to an analytical solution for the eddy diffusivity spectrum, whose integral yields a ``bulk'' diffusivity. The theory successfully predicts the smooth transition of diffusivity across the three regimes, and echoes with the recent argument that eddy phase propagation relative to the mean flow suppresses the eddy diffusivity. Moreover, the generalized theory reduces to the classical scaling arguments in both the strong friction and strong    {$\beta$}    limits, which has not been clear from the previous work on diffusivity suppression by flow-relative phase propagation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding the roles of land surface conditions and atmospheric circulation on continental daily temperature variance is key to improving predictions of temperature extremes. Evaporative resistance (rs, hereafter), a function of the land cover type, reflects the ease with which water can be evaporated or transpired and is a strong control on land-atmosphere interactions. This study explores the effects of rs perturbations on summer daily temperature variance using the Simple Land Interface Model (SLIM) by mimicking, for rs only, a global land cover conversion from forest to crop/grassland. Decreasing rs causes a global cooling. The cooling is larger in wetter areas and weaker in drier areas, and primarily results from perturbations in shortwave radiation (SW) and latent heat flux (LH). Decreasing rs enhances cloud cover due to greater land surface evaporation and thus reduces incoming SW over most land areas. When rs decreases, wetter areas experience strong evaporative cooling, while drier areas become more moisture-limited and thus experience less cooling. Thermal advection further shapes the temperature response by damping the combined impacts of SWand LH. Temperature variance increases in drier areas and decreases in wetter areas as rs decreases. The temperature variance changes can be largely explained from changes in the combined variance of SW and LH, including an important contribution of changes in the covariance of SW and LH. In contrast, the effects of changes in thermal advection variance mainly affect the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes.},

Here we present observational evidence for the response of precipitation to sea ice reduction and assess the sensitivity of the response. Changes in the proportion of moisture sourced from the Arctic with sea ice change in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland Sea regions over the past two decades are inferred from annually averaged deuterium excess (d-excess) measurements from six sites. Other influences on the Arctic hydrologic cycle, such as the strength of meridional transport, are assessed using the North Atlantic Oscillation index.

  abstract = {Abstract This work investigates the dynamic and thermal response of the winter stratosphere to the presence of a weak meridional surface temperature gradient. Previous work suggested that polar stratospheric clouds could have played a decisive role in maintaining high-latitude warmth, especially over continental interiors, during the polar nights of the late Paleocene and early Eocene epochs; both a chemical source of additional water vapor and a dynamical feedback between the surface climate and stratospheric temperatures have been proposed as mechanisms by which such clouds could form. A principal goal of this work is to investigate the latter problem using a general circulation model with stratospheric resolution that is forced with a very weak surface temperature gradient. It is found that temperatures in the lower stratosphere do not deviate significantly from the control run, which results from a robust flux of wave activity into the winter stratosphere. The strength of the stratosphere's residual circulation increases slightly in the presence of the weak gradient, as wavenumber 3 begins to propagate to stratospheric altitudes. Changes in the zonal wind field that allow for the altered propagation are in balance with a weakened temperature gradient through the full depth of the troposphere. These simulations also suggest that the tropospheric thermal stratification could be maintained by moist convection at all latitudes in warm climate states with a weak temperature gradient.},

A quantitative formulation for determining the depth of vertical wave activity fluxes and thus the terminus of the Hadley circulation is proposed based on the supercriticality, a measure of the slope of isentropes. The supercriticality assumes an approximately constant value at the terminus of the Hadley circulation in a series of simulations with an idealized dry general circulation model.

Previous work suggests that the frequency, intensity, and lifetime of these storms may be functions of the climate state, implying that transient tropical mixing could have been stronger during warmer equable climates with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide. Stronger mixing of the tropical oceans can force the oceans' meridional heat flux to increase, cooling tropical latitudes while warming higher ones. This response differs significantly from previous modeling studies of equable climates that used static mixing; coupling mixing to climate changes the dynamic response. A parameterization of mixing from tropical cyclones is developed, and including it leads to a cooling of tropical oceans and a warming of subtropical waters compared with control cases with fixed mixing.

To that end we examine the relationship between SAM and SST within unperturbed preindustrial control simulations of coupled general circulation models (GCMs) included in the Climate Modeling Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). We develop a technique to extract the response of the Southern Ocean SST (55\textdegree S\textendash 70\textdegree S) to a hypothetical step increase in the SAM index. We demonstrate that in many GCMs, the expected SST step response function is nonmonotonic in time. Following a shift to a positive SAM anomaly, an initial cooling regime can transition into surface warming around Antarctica. However, there are large differences across the CMIP5 ensemble. In some models the step response function never changes sign and cooling persists, while in other GCMs the SST anomaly crosses over from negative to positive values only 3~years after a step increase in the SAM. This intermodel diversity can be related to differences in the models' climatological thermal ocean stratification in the region of seasonal sea ice around Antarctica. Exploiting this relationship, we use observational data for the time-mean meridional and vertical temperature gradients to constrain the real Southern Ocean response to SAM on fast and slow timescales.},

Representations of AMOC differ vastly across the GCMs, providing a major source of intermodel spread in the sea surface temperature (SST) response.

Previous work in the design of perceptually uniform colour maps has mostly failed to recognise that CIELAB space is only designed to be perceptually uniform at very low spatial frequencies. The most important factor in designing a colour map is to ensure that the magnitude of the incremental change in perceptual lightness of the colours is uniform. The specific requirements for linear, diverging, rainbow and cyclic colour maps are developed in detail. To support this work two test images for evaluating colour maps are presented. The use of colour maps in combination with relief shading is considered and the conditions under which colour can enhance or disrupt relief shading are identified. Finally, a set of new basis colours for the construction of ternary images are presented. Unlike the RGB primaries these basis colours produce images whereby the salience of structures are consistent irrespective of the assignment of basis colours to data channels.},

To examine if a connection exists between recent Arctic sea ice loss and cyclone activity, several cyclone metrics from 60\textdegree{} to 90\textdegree N are analyzed. Results show that following years with less September sea ice, there is a subsequent increase in moisture availability, regional baroclinicity, and changes in vertical stability that favor cyclogenesis.

  abstract = {Abstract The response of the zonal-mean zonal winds in the tropical upper troposphere to thermal forcing in the Tropics is studied using an idealized general circulation model with 18 vertical levels and simplified atmospheric physics. The model produces a conventional general circulation, with deep easterly flow over the equator, when integrated using zonally invariant and hemispherically symmetric boundary conditions, but persistent equatorial superrotation (westerly zonal-mean flow over the equator) is obtained when steady longitudinal variations in diabatic heating are imposed at low latitudes. The superrotation is driven by horizontal eddy momentum fluxes associated with the stationary planetary wave response to the applied tropical heating. The strength of the equatorial westerlies is ultimately limited by vertical steady eddy momentum fluxes, which are downward in the tropical upper troposphere, and by the zonally averaged circulation in the meridional plane, which erodes the mean westerly shear via vertical advection. The transition to superrotation can be prevented by specifying offsetting zonally invariant heating and cooling anomalies on either side of the equator to create a ``solstitial'' basic state with a single dominant Hadley cell straddling the equator. Superrotation is restricted in the solstitial climate because the strength of the mean meridional overturning is enhanced, which increases the efficiency of vertical advection, and because the cross-equatorial flow in the upper troposphere provides an easterly zonal acceleration that offsets some of the momentum flux convergence associated with tropical eddy heating. The cross-equatorial flow aloft also reduces the stationary planetary wave response in the summer hemisphere. These results suggest that hemispheric asymmetry in the mean meridional circulation is responsible for maintaining the observed mean easterly flow in the tropical upper troposphere against the westerly torques associated with tropical wave sources.},

However, in what way the SPV will respond to global warming is not clear, with climate models disagreeing on the sign and magnitude of projected SPV strength change. Here we address the potential role of Barents and Kara (BK) sea ice loss in this. We provide evidence for a non-linear response of the SPV to global mean temperature change, which is coincident with the time the BK seas become ice-free. Using a causal network approach, we demonstrate that climate models show some partial support for the previously proposed link between low BK sea ice in autumn and a weakened winter SPV but that this effect is plausibly very small relative to internal variability. Yet, given the expected dramatic decrease in sea ice in the future, even a small causal effect can explain all of the projected ensemble-mean SPV weakening, approximately one-half of the ensemble spread in the middle of the 21st century, and one-third of the spread at the end of the century. Finally, we note that most models have unrealistic amounts of BK sea ice, meaning that their SPV response to ice loss is unrealistic. Bias adjusting for this effect leads to pronounced differences in SPV response of individual models at both ends of the spectrum but has no strong consequences for the overall ensemble mean and spread. Overall, our results indicate the importance of exploring all plausible implications of a changing Arctic for regional climate risk assessments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Since its inception, the dynamical tropopause based on potential vorticity (PV) is identified by the PV gradient on isentropes. Conceptually, significant isentropic gradients shown on the middle world PV maps reflect the underlying transport barrier associated with the tropopause, formed by jet streams that separate tropospheric air masses at low latitudes and stratospheric air masses at high latitudes. Largely owing to the lack of a general method, the dynamical tropopause has often been represented by a PV value chosen ad hoc without any temporal or spatial differentiation. In this work, we present a method for determining the PV isoline of the dynamical tropopause based on the isentropic PV gradients. Using 1 year of data from the European Centre for Medium\textendash Range Weather Forecasts, the spatial and temporal variability of this PV gradient-based dynamical tropopause is examined. The results show that in general there is a broad distribution of PV values at the dynamical tropopause, ranging from 1.5 to 5 potential vorticity units. Therefore, a fixed PV surface for all isentropes and seasons does not accurately represent the location of the tropopause barrier. The PV at the dynamical tropopause increases with increasing potential temperature. This increase is more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern Hemisphere. The seasonal cycle shows higher PV values at the dynamical tropopause during summer than during winter. This seasonal cycle is larger on higher isentropes. The dispersion of the PV at the dynamical tropopause about its mean is twofold larger during summer and autumn than during winter and spring in both hemispheres.},

  abstract = {The relationship between the static stability N2 and the mixing in the tropopause inversion layer (TIL) is investigated using in situ aircraft observations during SPURT (trace gas transport in the tropopause region). With a new simple measure of mixing degree based on O3-CO tracer correlations, high N2 related to an enhanced mixing in the extratropical mixing layer is found. This relation becomes even more pronounced if fresh mixing events are excluded, indicating that mixing within the TIL occurs on a larger than synoptic timescale. A temporal variance analysis of N2 suggests that processes responsible for the composition of the TIL take place on seasonal timescales. Using radiative transfer calculations, we simulate the influence of a change in O3 and H2O vertical gradients on the temperature gradient and thus on the static stability above the tropopause, which are contrasted in an idealized nonmixed atmosphere and in a reference mixed atmosphere. The results show that N2 increases with enhanced mixing degree near the tropopause. At the same time, the temperature above the tropopause decreases together with the development of an inversion and the TIL. In the idealized case of nonmixed profiles the TIL vanishes. Furthermore, the results suggest that H2O plays a major role in maintaining the temperature inversion and the TIL structure compared to O3. The results substantiate the link between the extratropical mixing layer and the TIL.},

This change may increase the humidity in Arctic air masses during the ice-growth season. Humidity increases may also be sustained by enhanced moisture transport into the Arctic and the relative influence of local- versus distant-moisture sources remains uncertain. Here we examined the predominant origin of Arctic water vapor during the ice-growth period, using water isotopologues (HDO, H218O) as tracers. An exploration of the isotopic evolution of surface water vapor in the Arctic Ocean found that isotopic values of moisture originating from the Arctic Ocean were characterized by higher d-excess values, a second-order isotopic parameter, than those of moisture originating from lower latitudes. These high d-excess values ({$>$}20\textperthousand ) in Arctic-origin air masses were observed in mid-autumn. Subsequently, high d-excess values gradually decreased to the global average (d = 10) and disappeared in early winter, when sea ice covered a large part of the Arctic Ocean. This change suggests that the humidity source of Arctic air masses switches in early winter from locally driven to moisture transport from lower latitudes.},

In this study, a dynamical analogy with the density thickness flux approach is explored to reexamine the theory of nonzonal wave\textendash mean flow interaction in two-dimensional horizontal flows. By analogy with the density thickness flux, the flux of thickness between potential vorticity (PV) surfaces is used as a starting point for a residual circulation formulation for nonzonal mean flows. Mean equations for barotropic PV dynamics are derived in which a modified mean velocity with an eddy-induced component advects a modified mean PV that also has an eddy-induced component. For small-amplitude eddies, the results are analogous to recent results of McDougall and McIntosh derived for stratified flow. The dynamical implications of this approach are then examined. The modified mean PV equation provides a decomposition of the eddy forcing of the mean flow into contributions from wave transience, wave dissipation, and wave-induced mass redistribution between PV contours. If the mean flow is along the mean PV contours, the contribution from wave-induced mass redistribution is ``workless'' in Plumb's sense that it is equivalent to an eddy-induced stress that is perpendicular to the mean flow. This contribution is also associated with the convergence along the mean streamlines of a modified PV flux that is equal to the difference between the PV flux and the rotational PV flux term identified by Illari and Marshall. The cross-stream component of the modified PV flux is related to wave transience and dissipation.},

  abstract = {The long-wavelength topography of Titan is characterized by relatively small amplitudes (about 1~km peak to peak), an anomalous equatorial bulge (the poles are about 300\,m lower than the equator), and small gravity anomalies, indicating a high degree of compensation. In the past years, the nature of Titan's non-hydrostatic topography has been addressed in several studies. The topography has been interpreted in terms of isostatic or viscous models and discussed in connection with tidal heating in the ice shell and surface erosion. Here, we present a model of the shape evolution of Titan's ice shell driven by tidal heating in the shell and spatial variations of the heat flux from a subsurface ocean. The model is obtained by solving a general set of equations coupling the viscoelastic flow of ice with the thermal evolution of the ice shell and phase transitions at the ice/water interface. The equations are solved in a domain with radially varying material properties and moving boundaries. The motion of the boundaries is a consequence of ice flow within the shell, melting and crystallization at the bottom boundary and erosion and deposition at the surface. Our model suggests that Titan's anomalous topographic bulge can be explained by lateral variations of ocean heat flux of the order of 0.1\textendash 1~mW~m-2, provided that the heat flux is stable over a period of at least 10~Myr and the ice shell has a sufficiently high viscosity, exceeding 1016~Pa~s at the base of the shell. Such a high value of viscosity implies that either the ice grains are coarse (\,{$\greaterequivlnt$}\,10~mm) or the temperature of the ocean is significantly (by more than 40~K) lower than the melting temperature of pure water ice. The heat flux pattern predicted on top of the ocean is consistent with a flow characterized by upwelling of warm water in polar regions and downwelling of cold water at low latitudes. The negative correlation between the topography and geoid at degree 3 reported in a previous study (but not confirmed at higher degrees yet) is shown to be compatible with erosion and deposition occurring at a rate of 0.01\textendash 0.1~mm~yr-1. Our results underline the importance of gravity and topography measurements for understanding Titan's surface and deep interior processes.},

  abstract = {It has been suggested that the long-wavelength topography of Titan is related to lateral variations in the heat flux from the ocean. Recent studies of the heat transfer in Titan's ocean agree that the time-averaged heat flux can vary in latitude by tens of percent, but they predict different distributions of heat flux anomalies at the upper boundary of the ocean. In order to clarify this issue, we perform 115 numerical simulations of thermal convection in a rotating spherical shell, varying the mechanical boundary conditions and dimensionless input parameters (Rayleigh, Ekman and Prandtl numbers) by at least one order of magnitude. The results of the simulations are examined in terms of the modified transitional number, RG{${_\ast}$}=RaEk12/7Pr-1. Depending on the relative importance of rotation, the heat flux maximum is located either at the equator (equatorial cooling) or at the poles (polar cooling). We demonstrate that equatorial cooling occurs when RG{${_\ast}<$}1 or RG{${_\ast}>$}10 while polar cooling occurs when RG{${_\ast}\in\langle$}1,10{$\rangle$}. Based on this result, we predict that Titan's ocean is in the polar cooling mode and the heat flux distribution is controlled by zonal degree 2 and 4 harmonics. The predicted heat flux shows a high degree of similarity with the axisymmetric part of Titan's long-wavelength topography, indicating a strong relationship between ocean dynamics and the processes in the ice shell.},

Here the connection between the storm-track and jet responses to climate change is examined using the Eliassen\textendash Palm (EP) relation. The EP relation states that the eddy potential energy flux is equal to the eddy momentum flux times the Doppler-shifted phase speed. The EP relation can be used to connect the storm-track and eddy-driven jet responses to climate change assuming 1) the storm-track and eddy potential energy flux responses are consistent and 2) the response of the Doppler-shifted phase speed is negligible. We examine the extent to which the EP relation connects the eddy-driven jet (eddy momentum flux convergence) response to climate change with the storm-track (eddy potential energy flux) response in two idealized aquaplanet model experiments. The two experiments, which differ in their radiation schemes, both show a poleward shift of the storm track in response to climate change. However, the eddy-driven jet shifts poleward using the sophisticated radiation scheme but equatorward using the gray radiation scheme. The EP relation gives a good approximation of the momentum flux response and the eddy-driven jet shift, given the eddy potential energy flux response, because the Doppler-shifted phase speed response is negligible. According to the EP relation, the opposite shift of the eddy-driven jet for the different radiation schemes is associated with dividing the eddy potential energy flux response by the climatological Doppler-shifted phase speed, which is dominated by the zonal-mean zonal wind.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The eddy energy is increased by controlling two parameters that affect baroclinic instability, causing the jet to shift poleward and leading to a stronger and less persistent annular mode. The transition in the jet variability properties as the eddy energy increases is associated with a transition from a merged (subtropical and eddy-driven) jet regime to an eddy-driven jet regime, and is accompanied by a transition in the eddy spectral properties. In the merged jet regime the spectrum is dominated by a single synoptic-scale wave mode, whereas in the eddy-driven jet regime the spectrum includes a wider range of planetary- and synoptic-scale waves. An eddy\textendash mean flow feedback mechanism explains the relation between the transition in the eddy spectrum and the jet variability properties. In the merged jet regime synoptic-scale waves maintain the jet close to its climatological position at all times and act as a positive feedback on the weak annular mode, increasing its persistence. In the eddy-driven jet regime the jet fluctuates between an equatorward-shifted state, which is similar to the merged jet, and a poleward-shifted state, where the eddy-driven jet is separated from the subtropical jet. The low persistence of the annular mode in the eddy-driven jet regime is due to a negative feedback by planetary-scale waves, which grow barotropically on the poleward flank of the jet during the equatorward-shifted jet state. The results of this study highlight the need to capture the dynamics of planetary-scale waves correctly in general circulation models in order to prevent the emergence of an overly persistent annular mode.},

How much of an impact would projected future climate change have on a storm such as Sandy? These questions are investigated using an ensemble of high-resolution numerical simulations in conjunction with analyzed and projected changes from a suite of general circulation models (GCMs). Simulations initialized with current analyses from the midpoint of Sandy's life cycle, while the system was centered near the Bahamas, adequately replicate the observed intensity and track of Sandy. Initial and boundary condition data are then altered with thermodynamic change fields obtained from a five-member GCM ensemble, allowing hypothetical replication of the synoptic weather pattern that accompanied Hurricane Sandy, but for large-scale thermodynamic conditions corresponding to the 1880s and for projections to the twenty-second century. The past ensemble produces a slightly weaker storm that makes landfall south of the observed location. The future ensemble depicts a significantly more intense system that makes landfall farther north, near Long Island, New York. Within the limitations of the methods used, it is suggested that climate change to date exerted only a modest influence on the intensity and track of Sandy. The strengthening in the simulations run with projected future warming is consistent with increased condensational heating; changes in the synoptic steering flow also appear to result from diabatic processes. The questions of how climate change affected Sandy's genesis and early life cycle, changes in the frequency of this type of synoptic pattern, and changes in impacts related to coastal development and sea level rise are not considered here.},

Surface properties control the partitioning of energy within the surface energy budget to fluxes of shortwave and longwave radiation, sensible and latent heat, and ground heat storage. Changes in surface energy fluxes can impact the atmosphere across scales through changes in temperature, cloud cover, and large-scale atmospheric circulation. We test the sensitivity of the atmosphere to global changes in three land surface properties: albedo, evaporative resistance, and surface roughness. We show the impact of changing these surface properties differs drastically between simulations run with an offline land model, compared to coupled land\textendash atmosphere simulations that allow for atmospheric feedbacks associated with land\textendash atmosphere coupling. Atmospheric feedbacks play a critical role in defining the temperature response to changes in albedo and evaporative resistance, particularly in the extratropics. More than 50\% of the surface temperature response to changing albedo comes from atmospheric feedbacks in over 80\% of land areas. In some regions, cloud feedbacks in response to increased evaporative resistance result in nearly 1 K of additional surface warming. In contrast, the magnitude of surface temperature responses to changes in vegetation height are comparable between offline and coupled simulations. We improve our fundamental understanding of how and why changes in vegetation cover drive responses in the atmosphere, and develop understanding of the role of individual land surface properties in controlling climate across spatial scales\textemdash critical to understanding the effects of land-use change on Earth's climate.},

In this study, the roles of different factors contributing to local surface warming are quantified using the radiative kernel method applied at the surface after 100 years of global warming under a representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scenario simulated by 32 climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The warming factors and their seasonality for land and oceanic surfaces were investigated separately and for different domains within each surface type where mechanisms differ. Common factors contribute to both land and oceanic surface warming: tropospheric-mean atmospheric warming and greenhouse gas increases (mostly through water vapor feedback) for both tropical and Arctic regions, nonbarotropic warming and surface warming sensitivity effects (negative in the tropics, positive in the Arctic), and warming cloud feedback in the Arctic in winter. Some mechanisms differ between land and oceanic surfaces: sensible and latent heat flux in the tropics, albedo feedback peaking at different times of the year in the Arctic due to different mean latitudes, a very large summer energy uptake and winter release by the Arctic Ocean, and a large evaporation enhancement in winter over the Arctic Ocean, whereas the peak occurs in summer over the ice-free Arctic land. The oceanic anomalous energy uptake and release is further studied, suggesting the primary role of seasonal variation of oceanic mixed layer temperature changes.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This study focuses on evaporation changes under global warming and their dependency on the direct warming effect, on the basis of future projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Over most of the tropical, subtropical and midlatitude regions, the direct contribution from surface temperature increase is found to dominate the projected increase in evaporation. This contribution is nevertheless offset partially, especially over the oceans, by contributions from weakening surface winds and increasing near-surface relative humidity. Greater warming of surface air than of the sea surface also acts to reduce surface evaporation, by reducing both the exchange coefficient and humidity contrast at the surface. Though generally of secondary importance, this contribution is the dominant factor over the subpolar oceans. Over the polar oceans, the effect of sea-ice retreat dominantly contributes to the evaporation increase in winter, whereas the reduced exchange coefficient and surface humidity contrast coupled with the sea-ice retreat account for most of the response during summertime. Over the continents, changes in the surface exchange coefficient, reflecting changes in soil moisture and vegetation among other factors, are important to modulate the direct effects of the warming and the generally reduced surface air relative humidity.},

Here we use five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 class Earth system model large ensembles to show how the Arctic is transitioning from a dominantly frozen state and to quantify the nature and timing of an emerging new Arctic climate in sea ice, air temperatures and precipitation phase (rain versus snow). Our results suggest that Arctic climate has already emerged in sea ice. Air temperatures will emerge under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario in the early- to mid-twenty-first century, followed by precipitation-phase changes. Despite differences in mean state and forced response, these models show striking similarities in their anthropogenically forced emergence from internal variability in Arctic sea ice, surface temperatures and precipitation-phase changes.},

The CCSM4 LM simulation reproduces many large-scale climate patterns suggested by historical and proxy-data records, with Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) surface temperatures cooling to the early 1800s Common Era by \textasciitilde 0.5\textdegree C (NH) and \textasciitilde 0.3\textdegree C (SH), followed by warming to the present. High latitudes of both hemispheres show polar amplification of the cooling from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) associated with sea ice increases. The LM simulation does not reproduce La Ni\~na\textendash like cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean during the MCA relative to the LIA, as has been suggested by proxy reconstructions. Still, dry medieval conditions over the southwestern and central United States are simulated in agreement with proxy indicators for these regions. Strong global cooling is associated with large volcanic eruptions, with indications of multidecadal colder climate in response to larger eruptions. The CCSM4's response to large volcanic eruptions captures some reconstructed patterns of temperature changes over Europe and North America, but not those of precipitation in the Asian monsoon region. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) has higher variance at centennial periods in the LM simulation compared to the 1850 nontransient run, suggesting a long-term Atlantic Ocean response to natural forcings. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), and El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability modes show little or no change. CCSM4 does not simulate a persistent positive NAO or a prolonged period of negative PDO during the MCA, as suggested by some proxy reconstructions.},

This turbulence can be due to shearing instabilities caused by strong flow deformations near the cloud top, and also to breaking gravity waves generated by cloud\textendash environment interactions. Turbulence above and around deep convection is an important safety issue for aviation, and improved understanding of the conditions that lead to out-of-cloud turbulence formation may result in better turbulence avoidance guidelines or forecasting capabilities. In this study, a series of high-resolution two- and three-dimensional model simulations of a severe thunderstorm are conducted to examine the sensitivity of above-cloud turbulence to a variety of background flow conditions\textemdash in particular, the above-cloud wind shear and static stability. Shortly after the initial convective overshoot, the above-cloud turbulence and mixing are caused by local instabilities in the vicinity of the cloud interfacial boundary. At later times, when the convection is more mature, gravity wave breaking farther aloft dominates the turbulence generation. This wave breaking is caused by critical-level interactions, where the height of the critical level is controlled by the above-cloud wind shear. The strength of the above-cloud wind shear has a strong influence on the occurrence and intensity of above-cloud turbulence, with intermediate shears generating more extensive regions of turbulence, and strong shear conditions producing the most intense turbulence. Also, more stable above-cloud environments are less prone to turbulence than less stable situations. Among other things, these results highlight deficiencies in current turbulence avoidance guidelines in use by the aviation industry.},

This investigation is motivated by an encounter between a commercial passenger aircraft and severe turbulence above a developing thunderstorm near Dickinson, North Dakota, on 10 July 1997. Very high-resolution two- and three-dimensional numerical simulations are used to investigate the possible causes of the turbulence encounter. These simulations explicitly resolve the convection and the turbulence-causing instabilities. The configurations of the models are consistent with the meteorological conditions surrounding the event. The turbulence generated in the numerical simulations can be placed into two general categories. The first category includes turbulence that remains local to the cloud top, and the second category includes turbulence that propagates away from the convection and owes its existence to the breakdown of convectively generated gravity waves. In both the two- and three-dimensional calculations, the local turbulence develops rapidly and occupies a layer about 1 km deep above the top of convective updrafts after their initial overshoot into the stratosphere. This local turbulence is generated by the highly nonlinear interactions between the overshooting convective updrafts and the tropopause. Gravity wave breakdown is only present in the two-dimensional calculation and occurs in a layer about 3 km deep and 30 km long. This gravity wave breakdown is attributed to an interaction between the gravity waves and a critical level induced by the background wind shear and cloud-induced wind perturbations above cloud top.},

The classical linear relationship used in energy balance models between the OLR and the SST holds quite well at high latitudes. This is not the case in the tropics; even for large-scale perturbations, especially antisymmetric about the equator, the correlation is poor. This is explained by the fact that the structure of the Hadley cell controls most of the properties of the tropical atmosphere, causing a local relationship between the surface and the top of the atmosphere to break down. This conclusion is supported by our analyses of the relationship between OLR and SST in the wavenumber domain. For very large-scale SST perturbations (wavenumbers 0\textendash 2) the agreement is reasonable \textemdash{} the OLR response has most of the energy in the same wavenumber. For higher wavenumbers, however, the correlation deteriorates and the OLR response has significant energy in other harmonics.},

The framework is designed to track particles representative of individual water molecules. A Monte Carlo approach facilitates the transition of particles between the different water classes (e.g., vapor, rain, or graupel). With this framework, it is possible to reconstruct the pathways of water as it moves from vapor at a particular altitude to rain at the surface. By tracking water molecules through both physical and microphysical space, the precipitation efficiency can be studied in detail as a function of height.             Large-eddy simulations of individual cumulus congestus clouds show that the clouds convert entrained vapor to surface precipitation with an efficiency of around 10\%. About two-thirds of all vapor that enters the cloud does so by entrainment in the free troposphere, but free-tropospheric vapor accounts for only one-third to one-half of the surface rainfall, with the remaining surface rainfall originating as vapor entrained through the cloud base. The smaller efficiency with which that laterally entrained water is converted into surface precipitation results from the smaller efficiencies with which it condenses, forms precipitating hydrometeors, and reaches the surface.},

  abstract = {Abstract Atmospheric superrotation with prograde equatorial winds and an equatorial angular momentum maximum is ubiquitous in planetary atmospheres. It is clear that eddy fluxes of angular momentum toward the equator are necessary to generate it. But under what conditions superrotation arises has remained unclear. This paper presents simulations and a scaling theory that establish conditions under which superrotation occurs in terrestrial atmospheres. Whether superrotation arises depends on the relative importance of factors that favor or disfavor superrotation. Convection preferentially generates Rossby waves near the equator, where the Rossby number is O(1). Since the Rossby waves transport angular momentum toward their source regions, this favors superrotation. Meridional temperature gradients preferentially lead to baroclinic instability and wave generation away from the equator. Eddy transport of angular momentum toward the baroclinic source region implies transport out of low latitudes, which disfavors superrotation. Simulations with an idealized GCM show that superrotation tends to arise when the equatorial convective generation of wave activity and its associated eddy angular momentum flux convergence exceed the baroclinic eddy angular momentum flux divergence. Convective and baroclinic wave activity generation is related through scaling arguments to mean-flow properties, such as planetary rotation rates and meridional temperature gradients. The scaling arguments show, for example, that superrotation is favored when the off-equatorial baroclinicity and planetary rotation rates are low, as they are, for example, on Venus. Similarly, superrotation is favored when the convective heating strengthens, which may account for the superrotation seen in extreme global warming simulations.},

They underpin climate science, feed into policies for adaptation and mitigation, and increase awareness of the impacts of climate change. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), a body of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) assesses the maturity of the required observing system and gives guidance for its development. The Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) are central to GCOS and the global community must monitor them with the highest standards in the form of Climate Data Records (CDR). Today, a single ECV - the sea ice ECV - encapsulates all aspects of the sea-ice environment. In the early 1990s it was a single variable (sea-ice concentration) but is today an umbrella for four variables (adding thickness, edge/extent, and drift). In this contribution, we argue that GCOS should from now on consider a set of seven ECVs (sea-ice concentration, thickness, snow-depth, surface temperature, surface albedo, age, and drift). These seven ECVs are critical and cost-effective to monitor with existing satellite Earth Observation capability. We advise against placing these new variables under the umbrella of the single sea ice ECV. To start a set of distinct ECVs is indeed critical to avoid adding to the sub-optimal situation we experience today, and to reconcile the sea ice variables with the practice in other ECV domains.

Several aspects of the surface climate simulation are improved in CCSM4. Improvements in the simulation of soil water storage, evapotranspiration, surface albedo, and permafrost that are apparent in offline CLM4 simulations are generally retained in CCSM4. The global land air temperature bias is reduced and the annual cycle is improved in many locations, especially at high latitudes. The global land precipitation bias is larger in CCSM4 because of bigger wet biases in central and southern Africa and Australia. New earth system capabilities are assessed. The present-day air temperature within urban areas is warmer than surrounding rural areas by 1\textdegree\textendash 2\textdegree C, which is comparable to or greater than the change in climate occurring over the last 130 years.

In the future, land-use activities are likely to expand and intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. The Land Use Model Intercomparison Project (LUMIP) aims to further advance understanding of the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) on climate, specifically addressing the following questions. (1) What are the effects of LULCC on climate and biogeochemical cycling (past\textendash future)? (2) What are the impacts of land management on surface fluxes of carbon, water, and energy, and are there regional land-management strategies with the promise to help mitigate climate change? In addressing these questions, LUMIP will also address a range of more detailed science questions to get at process-level attribution, uncertainty, data requirements, and other related issues in more depth and sophistication than possible in a multi-model context to date. There will be particular focus on the separation and quantification of the effects on climate from LULCC relative to all forcings, separation of biogeochemical from biogeophysical effects of land use, the unique impacts of land-cover change vs. land-management change, modulation of land-use impact on climate by land\textendash atmosphere coupling strength, and the extent to which impacts of enhanced CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations on plant photosynthesis are modulated by past and future land use.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}LUMIP involves three major sets of science activities: (1) development of an updated and expanded historical and future land-use data set, (2) an experimental protocol for specific LUMIP experiments for CMIP6, and (3) definition of metrics and diagnostic protocols that quantify model performance, and related sensitivities, with respect to LULCC. In this paper, we describe LUMIP activity (2), i.e., the LUMIP simulations that will formally be part of CMIP6. These experiments are explicitly designed to be complementary to simulations requested in the CMIP6 DECK and historical simulations and other CMIP6 MIPs including ScenarioMIP, C4MIP, LS3MIP, and DAMIP. LUMIP includes a two-phase experimental design. Phase one features idealized coupled and land-only model simulations designed to advance process-level understanding of LULCC impacts on climate, as well as to quantify model sensitivity to potential land-cover and land-use change. Phase two experiments focus on quantification of the historic impact of land use and the potential for future land management decisions to aid in mitigation of climate change. This paper documents these simulations in detail, explains their rationale, outlines plans for analysis, and describes a new subgrid land-use tile data request for selected variables (reporting model output data separately for primary and secondary land, crops, pasture, and urban land-use types). It is essential that modeling groups participating in LUMIP adhere to the experimental design as closely as possible and clearly report how the model experiments were executed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

For instance, entrainment is widely believed to be a fundamentally turbulent process, even though Turner pointed out in 1957 that dry thermals entrain primarily because of buoyancy (via a dynamical constraint requiring an increase in radius r). Furthermore, entrainment has been postulated to obey a 1/r scaling, but this scaling has not been firmly established. Here, we study the classic case of dry thermals in a neutrally stratified environment using fully resolved direct numerical simulation. We combine this with a thermal tracking algorithm that defines a control volume for the thermal at each time, allowing us to directly measure entrainment. We vary the Reynolds number (Re) of our thermals between laminar (Re {$\approx$} 600) and turbulent (Re {$\approx$} 6000) regimes, finding only a 20\% variation in entrainment rate {$\epsilon$}, supporting the claim that turbulence is not necessary for entrainment. We also directly verify the postulated {$\epsilon$} \textasciitilde{} 1/r scaling law.},

Of primary interest is whether the enthalpy flux from open water in the seasonal sea-ice zone is the predominant contributing mechanism or whether the advective fields of vorticity and thickness are controlling factors. This is of importance in discussions of the feedback processes between the atmosphere, cryosphere and ocean. For a case selected in the Laptev Sea near the end of the fall period of ice growth, the surface enthalpy flux is as significant a contribution to synoptic activity as the vorticity advection is. The enthalpy flux is a relatively insignificant factor at this time in the Beaufort Sea, however, because of the smaller area of open water and the lower wind speeds associated with the weaker synoptic systems in this region. It is also relatively insignificant at both locations at the beginning of the fall freeze-up interval and in June, during the melt period.},

During flight no. 7, two remarkable layers are measured in the TTL, namely (1) the moist layer (ML) with a water vapour content of 4.8\textendash 5.7\&thinsp;ppmv in altitudes of 18\textendash 19\&thinsp;km in the lower stratosphere and (2) the ice layer (IL) with ice content up to 1.9\&thinsp;eq.\&thinsp;ppmv (equivalent parts per million by volume) in altitudes of 17\textendash 18\&thinsp;km in the upper troposphere at around 06:30\&thinsp;UTC on 8 August to the south of Kathmandu (Nepal). A Meso-NH convection-permitting simulation succeeds in reproducing the characteristics of the ML and IL. Through analysis, we show that the ML and IL are generated by convective overshoots that occurred over the Sichuan Basin about 1.5\&thinsp;d before. Overshooting clouds develop at altitudes up to 19\&thinsp;km, hydrating the lower stratosphere of up to 20\&thinsp;km with 6401\&thinsp;t of water vapour by a strong-to-moderate mixing of the updraughts with the stratospheric air. A few hours after the initial overshooting phase, a hydration patch is generated, and a large amount of water vapour (above 18\&thinsp;ppmv) remains at even higher altitudes up to 20.5\&thinsp;km while the anvil cloud top descends to 18.5\&thinsp;km. At the same time, a great part of the hydrometeors falls shortly, and the water vapour concentration in the ML and IL decreases due to turbulent diffusion by mixing with the tropospheric air, ice nucleation, and water vapour deposition. As the hydration patch continues to travel toward the south of Kathmandu, tropospheric tracer concentration increases up to {$\sim$}30\&thinsp;\% and 70\&thinsp;\% in the ML and IL, respectively. The air mass in the layers becomes gradually diffused, and it has less and less water vapour and ice content by mixing with the dry tropospheric air.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In the upper atmosphere, anthropogenic climate change is strengthening this meridional temperature gradient by cooling the polar lower stratosphere2,3 and warming the tropical upper troposphere4\textendash 6, acting to strengthen the upper-level jet stream7. In contrast, in the lower atmosphere, Arctic amplification of global warming is weakening the meridional temperature gradient8\textendash 10, acting to weaken the upper-level jet stream. Therefore, trends in the speed of the upper-level jet stream11\textendash 13 represent a closely balanced tug-of-war between two competing effects at different altitudes14. It is possible to isolate one of the competing effects by analysing the vertical shear\textemdash the change in wind speed with height\textemdash instead of the wind speed, but this approach has not previously been taken. Here we show that, although the zonal wind speed in the North Atlantic polar jet stream at 250~hectopascals has not changed since the start of the observational satellite era in 1979, the vertical shear has increased by 15 per cent (with a range of 11\textendash 17 per cent) according to three different reanalysis datasets15\textendash 17. We further show that this trend is attributable to the thermal wind response to the enhanced upper-level meridional temperature gradient. Our results~indicate that climate change may be having a larger impact on the North Atlantic jet stream than previously thought.~The increased vertical shear is consistent with the intensification of shear-driven clear-air turbulence expected from climate change18\textendash 20, which will affect aviation in the busy transatlantic flight corridor~by creating a more turbulent flying environment for aircraft. We conclude that the effects of climate change and variability on the upper-level jet stream are being partly obscured by the traditional focus on wind speed rather than wind shear.},

Worldwide, educational attainment is the single strongest predictor of climate change awareness.

Here we show how stable water vapor isotopes, which are sensitive to the convective condensation rates, may be useful for evaluating convective parameterizations. By varying one of the least constrained convection parameters in the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), namely the timescale for consumption of convective available potential energy (CAPE), {$\tau$}, the simulated precipitation experiences substantial changes in response to changes in both the deep and shallow convection schemes\textemdash increasing {$\tau$} from the standard 2 hours to 8 hours increases the contribution from shallow convection. The lowest order effect of increasing {$\tau$} is a decrease (increase) in lower (upper) tropospheric condensation rates, with approximately the opposite vertical structure for the change in simulated isotopic signature. Increasing {$\tau$} from the standard 2 hours to 8 hours also provides a better match to satellite-observed water vapor isotope ratios, albeit with some uncertainty related to the quality of currently-available satellite measurements. Thus, the incorporation of water vapor isotopes into GCMs provides additional constraints on convective parameterizations, especially as more and better quality water vapor isotope measurements become available.},

Surface and top-of-the-atmosphere energy fluxes were used to calculate the composite zonal-mean poleward moist static energy transport.

Because the total tropical convective heating is more localized during La Ni\~na than El Ni\~no, these findings suggest that the Arctic surface air temperature anomalies associated with ENSO may be attributed to the tropically excited Arctic warming mechanism (TEAM).

This phenomenon is known as polar amplification. Understanding this equator-to-pole temperature gradient is fundamental to climate and general circulation, yet there is no established theory from a perspective of the general circulation. Here, a general circulation-based theory for polar amplification is presented. Recognizing the fact that most of the available potential energy (APE) in the atmosphere is untapped, this theory invokes that La-Ni\~na-like tropical heating can help tap APE and warm the Arctic by exciting poleward and upward propagating Rossby waves.},

Numerous efforts have been conducted to study the climate of such planets, using in particular 3D global climate models (GCMs). One of the biggest challenges in simulating such an extreme environment is to properly represent the effects of sub-grid convection. Most GCMs use either a simplistic convective-adjustment parameterization or sophisticated (e.g., mass flux scheme) Earth-tuned parameterizations. One way to improve the representation of convection is to study convection using numerical convection-resolving models (CRMs), with a fine spatial resolution. In this study, we developed a CRM coupling the non-hydrostatic dynamical core Advanced Research Weather-Weather Research and Forecast model with the radiative transfer and cloud/precipitation models of the Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique generic climate model to study convection and clouds on tidally locked planets, with a focus on Proxima b. Simulations were performed for a set of three surface temperatures (corresponding to three different incident fluxes) and two rotation rates, assuming an Earth-like atmosphere. The main result of our study is that while we recover the prediction of GCMs that (low-altitude) cloud albedo increases with increasing stellar flux, the cloud feedback is much weaker due to transient aggregation of convection leading to low partial cloud cover.},

It is commonly assumed that post-snowball climate dominated by CO2 partial pressures several hundred times greater than modern levels, would be characterized by extreme temperatures, a vigorous hydrological cycle, and associated high continental weathering rates. However, the climate in the aftermath of a global glaciation has never been rigorously modelled. Here, we use a hierarchy of numerical models, from an atmospheric general circulation model to a mechanistic model describing continental weathering processes, to explore characteristics of the Earth system during the supergreenhouse climate following a snowball glaciation. These models suggest that the hydrological cycle intensifies only moderately in response to the elevated greenhouse. Indeed, constraints imposed by the surface energy budget sharply limit global mean evaporation once the temperature has warmed sufficiently that the evaporation approaches the total absorbed solar radiation. Even at 400 times the present day pressure of atmospheric CO2, continental runoff is only 1.2 times the modern runoff. Under these conditions and accounting for the grinding of the continental surface by the ice sheet during the snowball event, the simulated maximum discharge of dissolved elements from continental weathering into the ocean is approximately 10 times greater than the modern flux. Consequently, it takes millions of years for the silicate weathering cycle to reduce post-snowball CO2 levels to background Neoproterozoic levels. Regarding the origin of the cap dolostones, we show that continental weathering alone does not supply enough cations during the snowball melting phase to account for their observed volume.},

First, we show that, compared to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System-Energy Balanced and Filled, CloudSat-CALIPSO better represents cloud liquid and ice water path over high latitudes, owing to its recent explicit determination of cloud phase that will be part of its new R05 release. The reanalyses and climate models disagree widely on the amount of cloud liquid and ice in the polar regions. Compared to the observations, we find significant but inconsistent biases in the model simulations of cloud liquid and ice water, as well as in the downwelling radiation components. The CMIP5 models display a wide range of cloud characteristics of the polar regions, especially with regard to cloud liquid water, limiting the representativeness of the multimodel mean. A few CMIP5 models (CNRM, GISS, GFDL, and IPSL\_CM5b) clearly outperform the others, which enhances credibility in their projected future cloud and radiation changes over high latitudes. Given the rapid changes in polar regions and global feedbacks involved, future climate model developments should target improved representation of polar clouds. To that end, remote sensing observations are crucial, in spite of large remaining observational uncertainties, which is evidenced by the substantial differences between the two data sets.},

  abstract = {The `energy imbalance problem' in micrometeorology arises because at most flux measurement sites the sum of eddy fluxes of sensible and latent heat (H+{$\lambda$}E) is less than the available energy (A). Either eddy fluxes are underestimated or A is overestimated. Reasons for the imbalance are: (1) a failure to satisfy the fundamental assumption of one-dimensional transport that is necessary for measurements on a single tower to represent spatially-averaged fluxes to/from the underlying surface, and (2) measurement errors in eddy fluxes, net radiation and changes in energy storage in soils, air and biomass below the measurement height. Radiometer errors are unlikely to overestimate A significantly, but phase lags caused by incorrect estimates of the energy storage terms can explain why H+{$\lambda$}E systematically underestimates A at half-hourly time scales. Energy closure is observed at only 8\% of flux sites in the La Thuile dataset (http://www.fluxdata.org/DataInfo/default.aspx) with half-hourly averages but this increases to 45\% of sites using 24h averages because energy entering the soil, air and biomass in the morning is returned in the afternoon and evening. Unrealistically large and positive horizontal gradients in temperature and humidity are needed for advective flux divergences to explain the energy imbalance at half-hourly time scales. Imbalances between H+{$\lambda$}E and A still occur in daily averages but the small residual energy imbalances are explicable by horizontal and vertical advective flux divergences. Systematic underestimates of the vertical heat flux also occur if horizontal u{${'}$}T{${'}$} covariances contaminate the vertical w{${'}$}T{${'}$} signal due to incorrect coordinate rotations. Closure of the energy balance is possible at half-hourly time scales by careful attention to all sources of measurement and data processing errors in the eddy covariance system and by accurate measurement of net radiation and every energy storage term needed to calculate available energy.},

Recent revisions to greenhouse gas forcing and post-1990 ozone and aerosol forcing estimates are incorporated and the forcing data extended from 2011 to 2016. Reflecting recent evidence against strong aerosol forcing, its AR5 uncertainty lower bound is increased slightly. Using an 1869\textendash 82 base period and a 2007\textendash 16 final period, which are well matched for volcanic activity and influence from internal variability, medians are derived for ECS of 1.50 K (5\%\textendash 95\% range: 1.05\textendash 2.45 K) and for TCR of 1.20 K (5\%\textendash 95\% range: 0.9\textendash 1.7 K). These estimates both have much lower upper bounds than those from a predecessor study using AR5 data ending in 2011. Using infilled, globally complete temperature data give slightly higher estimates: a median of 1.66 K for ECS (5\%\textendash 95\% range: 1.15\textendash 2.7 K) and 1.33 K for TCR (5\%\textendash 95\% range: 1.0\textendash 1.9 K). These ECS estimates reflect climate feedbacks over the historical period, assumed to be time invariant. Allowing for possible time-varying climate feedbacks increases the median ECS estimate to 1.76 K (5\%\textendash 95\% range: 1.2\textendash 3.1 K), using infilled temperature data. Possible biases from non\textendash unit forcing efficacy, temperature estimation issues, and variability in sea surface temperature change patterns are examined and found to be minor when using globally complete temperature data. These results imply that high ECS and TCR values derived from a majority of CMIP5 climate models are inconsistent with observed warming during the historical period.},

Here, perspectives of the event are shared by scientists from three national meteorological or climate services that issue regular operational updates on the status and prediction of El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Public advisories on the unfolding El Ni\~no were issued in the first half of 2015. This was followed by significant growth in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies, a peak during November 2015\textendash January 2016, subsequent decay, and its demise during May 2016. The life cycle and magnitude of the 2015/16 El Ni\~no was well predicted by most models used by national meteorological services, in contrast to the generally overexuberant model predictions made the previous year. The evolution of multiple atmospheric and oceanic measures demonstrates the rich complexity of ENSO, as a coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere phenomenon with pronounced global impacts. While some aspects of the 2015/16 El Ni\~no rivaled the events of 1982/83 and 1997/98, we show that it also differed in unique and important ways, with implications for the study and evaluation of past and future ENSO events. Unlike previous major El Ni\~nos, remarkably above-average SST anomalies occurred in the western and central equatorial Pacific but were milder near the coast of South America. While operational ENSO systems have progressed markedly over the past several decades, the 2015/16 El Ni\~no highlights several challenges that will continue to test both the research and operational forecast communities.},

Based on the ERA-5 reanalysis products, we explored the impacts of warm and moist air-mass transport on this extreme event. The results revealed that anomalously high energy and moisture converged into these regions in the spring months (April to June) of 2020, leading to a burst of high moisture content and warming within the atmospheric column. The convergence is accompanied by local enhanced downward longwave surface radiation and turbulent fluxes, which is favorable for initiating an early melt onset in the region with severe ice loss. Once the melt begins, solar radiation plays a decisive role in leading to further sea ice depletion due to ice\textendash albedo positive feedback. The typical trajectories of the synoptic cyclones that occurred on the Eurasian side in spring 2020 agree well with the path of atmospheric flow. Assessments suggest that variations in characteristics of the spring cyclones are conducive to the severe melt of sea ice. We argue that large-scale atmospheric circulation and synoptic cyclones acted in concert to trigger the exceptional poleward transport of total energy and moisture from April to June to cause this record minimum of sea ice extent in the following July.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Poleward energy transport in the atmosphere and oceans constitutes an important branch of the global energy budget, and its role in the climate system has been the subject of many studies. In the atmosphere, the transport is affected by ``eddies'' and large scale meridional cells, both with zero net mass transport across latitude circles, but also partly by processes associated with a net transport of mass across latitude circles. The latter must cease to operate in steady state, but they may be significant when time variability of the heat budget is considered. Indeed, examination of reanalysis data on short (daily to monthly) timescales shows that mass variations on these timescales result in surprisingly large fluctuations (in excess of \$\$10\^\{15\}\$\$W = 1 PW) in the poleward heat transport. These fluctuations are referred to as ``extensive'', for they primarily alter the mass integrated energy of the region considered, but not its averaged value. It is suggested that extensive fluctuations mask more meaningful climate signals present in the heat transport variability~\hspace{0pt}on monthly and interannual timescales, and a new formulation is proposed to isolate the latter. This new formulation is applied successfully to reanalysis data and climate model simulations.},

Li et al. conducted experiments using a climate model to show that the installation of large-scale wind and solar power generation facilities in the Sahara could cause more local rainfall, particularly in the neighboring Sahel region. This effect, caused by a combination of increased surface drag and reduced albedo, could increase coverage by vegetation, creating a positive feedback that would further increase rainfall. Science, this issue p. 1019 Wind and solar farms offer a major pathway to clean, renewable energies. However, these farms would significantly change land surface properties, and, if sufficiently large, the farms may lead to unintended climate consequences. In this study, we used a climate model with dynamic vegetation to show that large-scale installations of wind and solar farms covering the Sahara lead to a local temperature increase and more than a twofold precipitation increase, especially in the Sahel, through increased surface friction and reduced albedo. The resulting increase in vegetation further enhances precipitation, creating a positive albedo\textendash precipitation\textendash vegetation feedback that contributes \textasciitilde 80\% of the precipitation increase for wind farms. This local enhancement is scale dependent and is particular to the Sahara, with small impacts in other deserts.

  abstract = {The Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the last ice age are among the best studied abrupt climate changes, yet a comprehensive explanation is still lacking. They are most pronounced in the North Atlantic, where they manifest as large temperature swings, on timescales of decades or shorter, between persistent cold (stadial) and warm (interstadial) conditions. This review examines evidence that Dansgaard-Oeschger events are an unforced or ``spontaneous'' oscillation of the coupled atmosphere-ice-ocean system comprising the North Atlantic, Nordic Seas and Arctic, collectively termed the Northern Seas. Insights from reanalysis data, climate model simulations, and idealized box model experiments point to the subpolar gyre as a key coupling region where vigorous wind systems encounter the southernmost extension of sea ice and the most variable currents of the North Atlantic, with connections to the deep ocean via convection. We argue that, under special conditions, these components can interact to produce Dansgaard-Oeschger events. Finding the sweet spot is a matter of understanding when the subpolar region enters a feedback loop whereby changes in wind forcing, sea ice cover, and ocean circulation amplify and sustain perturbations towards cold (ice-covered) or warm (ice-free) conditions. The resulting Dansgaard-Oeschger-like variability is seen in a handful of model simulations, including some ``ugly duckling'' pre-industrial simulations: these may be judged as undesirable at the outset, but ultimately show value in suggesting that current models include the necessary physics to produce abrupt climate transitions, but exhibit incorrect sensitivity to the boundary conditions. Still, glacial climates are hypothesized to favour larger, more persistent transitions due to differences in large-scale wind patterns. Simplified models and idealized experimental setups may provide a means to constrain how the critical processes act, both in isolation and in combination, to destabilize the subpolar North Atlantic.},

In the extratropics of both hemispheres, the primary impacts of ACRE on the circulation include 1) increases in the meridional temperature gradient and decreases in static stability in the midlatitude upper troposphere, 2) strengthening of the midlatitude jet, 3) increases in extratropical eddy kinetic energy by up to 30\%, and 4) increases in precipitation at middle latitudes but decreases at subtropical latitudes. In the tropics, the primary impacts of ACRE include 1) eastward wind anomalies in the tropical upper troposphere\textendash lower stratosphere (UTLS) and 2) reductions in tropical precipitation. The impacts of ACRE on the atmospheric circulation are interpreted in the context of a series of dynamical and physical processes. The changes in the extratropical circulation and precipitation are consistent with the influence of ACRE on the baroclinicity and eddy fluxes of momentum in the extratropical upper troposphere, the changes in the zonal wind in the UTLS with the influence of ACRE on the amplitude of the equatorial planetary waves, and the changes in the tropical precipitation with the energetic constraints on the tropical troposphere. The results make clear that ACRE have a pronounced influence on the atmospheric circulation not only at tropical latitudes, but at extratropical latitudes as well. They highlight the critical importance of correctly simulating ACRE in global climate models.},

This scaling CAPE was applied in a specific idealized framework, but the extent to which it can predict true CAPE in the real world has not been tested. This work uses reanalysis data over the U.S. to demonstrate that this scaling CAPE does indeed scale very closely with CAPE, following a linear relationship with a scaling factor of 0.44. We then explain why they scale together via a step-by-step derivation of the theoretical assumptions linking scaling CAPE and real CAPE and their manifestation in the historical data.

This expression unifies various formulas published in the literature and can be generalized to account for chemical reactions. Unlike previous methods, it converges to machine precision independent of mesh size. It accounts for any ratio of condensable vapors to dry gas, from zero to infinity, and for variable heat capacities as a function of temperature. Because the derivation is generic, the new formula is not only applicable to planetary atmospheres in the solar system but also to hot Jupiters and brown dwarfs in which a variety of alkali metals, silicates, and exotic materials condense. It is demonstrated that even though the vapors are ideal gases, they interact in their effects on the moist adiabatic lapse rate. Finally, the authors apply the new thermodynamic model to study the effects of downdrafts on the distribution of minor constituents and the thermal profile in the Galileo probe hot spot. The authors find that the Galileo probe measurements can be interpreted as a strong downdraft that displaces an air parcel from the 1-bar to the 4-bar level (1 bar = 100 000 Pa).},

The attribution of the time-evolving net radiative feedback highlights the remote impact from OHU over the Southern Ocean on tropical sea surface temperature. The time-dependent weakening of OHU over the Southern Ocean gives rise to increasingly enhanced surface warming in southeastern Pacific, which leads to decreasing tropospheric stability and more positive cloud feedback decades after quadrupling CO2.},

The authors provide a description of the model, detail how preindustrial-control and twentieth-century experiments were initialized and forced, and examine the behavior of the carbon cycle in those experiments. They examine how sea- and land-to-air CO2 fluxes contribute to the increase of atmospheric CO2 in the twentieth century, analyze how atmospheric CO2 and its surface fluxes vary on interannual time scales, including how they respond to ENSO, and describe the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 and its surface fluxes. While the model broadly reproduces observed aspects of the carbon cycle, there are several notable biases, including having too large of an increase in atmospheric CO2 over the twentieth century and too small of a seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 in the Northern Hemisphere. The biases are related to a weak response of the carbon cycle to climatic variations on interannual and seasonal time scales and to twentieth-century anthropogenic forcings, including rising CO2, land-use change, and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen.},

  abstract = {Abstract The temporal variability of the six terms of the energy balance equation for a slab of ice 3 m thick is calculated based on 45 yr of surface meteorological observations from the drifting ice stations of the former Soviet Union. The equation includes net radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, bottom heat flux, heat storage, and energy available for melting. The energy balance is determined with a time-dependent 10-layer thermodynamic model of the ice slab that determines the surface temperature and the ice temperature profile using 3-h forcing values. The observations used for the forcing values are the 2-m air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed, the cloud fraction, the snow depth and density, and the albedo of the nonponded ice. The downwelling radiative fluxes are estimated with parameterizations based on the cloud cover, the air temperature and humidity, and the solar angle. The linear relationship between the air temperature and both the cloud fraction and the wind speed is also determined for each month of the year. The annual cycles of the mean values of the terms of the energy balance equation are all nearly equal to those calculated by others based on mean climatological forcing values. The short-term variability, from 3 h to 16 days, of both the forcings and the fluxes, is investigated on a seasonal basis with the discreet wavelet transform. Significant diurnal cycles are found in the net radiation, storage, and melt, but not in the sensible or latent heat fluxes. The total annual ice-melt averages 0.67 m, ranges between 0.29 and 1.09 m, and exhibits large variations from year to year. It is closely correlated with the albedo and, to a lesser extent, with the latitude and the length of the melt season.},

Our approach is to consider a simple one-layer model of the trade cumulus boundary layer wherein surface temperature gradients are mixed vertically\textemdash consistent with ECMWF analyzed data. The top of the layer is taken at 700 mb. The influence from higher levels is intentionally suppressed by setting horizontal pressure gradients and frictional stresses to zero at the top of the layer. Horizontal convergence within the layer is taken up by cumulonimbus mass flux. However, the development of the cumulonimbus mass flux is associated with a short relaxation time [O({$\frac{1}{2}$} hr)] (roughly the development time for such convection). During this short time, horizontal convergence acts to redistribute mass so as to reduce horizontal pressure gradients. This effect proves important in the immediate neighborhood of the equator. Our results show that flows forced directly by surface temperature are often comparable to observed low-level flows in both magnitude and distribution.},

The absolute growth rates are calculated, incorporating the effects of both Ekman friction and barotropic shear. It is found that these effects do not alter earlier conclusions (based on simpler models)that a finite easterly low-level wind is required for absolute instability in models with continuous shear. Ekman friction exacerbates the situation, shifting the absolute instability threshold from essentially zero surface wind to negative surface wind. While absolute instability of the midlatitude terrestrial jets thus seems unlikely, the conclusion stands that the atmosphere is at least near the boundary of absolute instability, especially under conditions prevailing in the oceanic storm tracks. In consequence, slow-moving short waves with growth rates below the maximum normal-mode growth rate typically contribute more to the amplification of wave packets as they cross a finite length baroclinic zone than the faster-growing but faster-growing most-unstable mode. For oceanic storm track conditions, a disturbance can amplify by a factor of several hundred during its time in a typical zonally localized baroclinic zone, even though the flow is not absolutely unstable. A measure of linear growth that is more revealing than normal-mode growth rate is proposed, which could be suitable for diagnostic studies. Consequences of the results for the nature of the storm tracks are discussed.},

In this view, deep convection develops or decays almost instantly to remove any changes of convective instability, making the tropospheric temperature always tied to the boundary layer moist static energy. The present study examines the validity of the CQE hypothesis at different vertical levels using long-term sounding data from tropical convection centers. The results show that the tropical atmosphere is far from the CQE with much weaker warming in the middle and upper troposphere associated with the increase of boundary layer moist static energy. This is true for all the time scales resolved by the observational data, ranging from hourly to interannual and decadal variability. It is possibly caused by the ubiquitous existence of shallow convection and stratiform precipitation, both leading to sign reversal of heating from lower to upper troposphere. The simulations by 42 global climate models from phases 3 and 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparsion Project (CMIP3 and CMIP5) are also analyzed and compared with the observations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This circulation is typically quantified from model output by calculating the tropical upwelling vertical velocity in the residual circulation framework, and it is estimated from observations by using time series of tropical water vapor to infer a vertical velocity. Recent theory has introduced a method to calculate the strength of the global mean diabatic circulation through isentropes from satellite measurements of long-lived tracers. In this paper, we explore this global diabatic circulation as it relates to the residual circulation vertical velocity, stratospheric water vapor, and ozone at interannual timescales. We use a comprehensive climate model, three reanalysis data products, and satellite ozone data. The different metrics for the circulation have different properties, especially with regards to the vertical autocorrelation. In the model, the different residual circulation metrics agree closely and are well correlated with the global diabatic circulation, except in the lowermost stratosphere. In the reanalysis products, however, there are more differences throughout, indicating the dynamical inconsistencies of these products. The vertical velocity derived from the time series of water vapor in the tropics is significantly correlated with the global diabatic circulation, but this relationship is not as strong as that between the global diabatic circulation and the residual circulation vertical velocity. We find that the global diabatic circulation in the lower to middle stratosphere (up to 500\&thinsp;K) is correlated with the total column ozone in the high latitudes and in the tropics. The upper-level circulation is also correlated with the total column ozone, primarily in the subtropics, and we show that this is due to the correlation of both the circulation and the ozone with upper-level temperatures.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Trends in the age of stratospheric air, deduced from observations of transient tracers, have been used to identify trends in the circulation, but there are ambiguities in the relationship between age and the strength of the circulation. This paper presents a steady-state theory and a time-dependent extension to relate age of air directly to the diabatic circulation of the stratosphere. In steady state, it is the difference between the age of upwelling and downwelling air through an isentrope and not the absolute value of age that is a measure of the strength of the diabatic circulation through that isentrope. For the time-varying case, expressions for other terms that contribute to the age budget are derived. An idealized atmospheric general circulation model with and without a seasonal cycle is used to test the time-dependent theory and to find that these additional terms are small upon annual averaging. The steady-state theory holds as well for annual averages of a seasonally varying model as for a perpetual-solstice model. These results are a step toward using data to quantify the strength of the diabatic circulation.},

Measuring the strength of the circulation directly is not possible, and so it must be inferred from tracer measurements. Long-lived trace gases can be related to the idealized tracer age of air, which describes how long an air parcel has been in the stratosphere. In this paper, we derive a quantitative relationship between the vertical gradient of age and the horizontal mixing between the tropics and the extratropics using a ``leaky pipe'' framework in isentropic coordinates. Mixing rates of air into and out of the tropics are related to the vertical gradient of age in the tropics and in the extratropics, respectively. The derivation is repeated with the hemispheres separated so that the vertical structure of the mixing in the two hemispheres can be compared directly. These theories are applied to output from an idealized model of the stratosphere and from a realistic chemistry-climate model to test our assumptions and calculate the mixing rates in the models. We then perform a quantitative comparison of the mixing rates in the Northern and Southern hemispheres along with an examination of where such a separation is valid. Finally, we perform a very preliminary calculation of mixing efficiency with satellite data to demonstrate the use of the mixing metric to compare mixing in models and data.},

Higher in the atmosphere, only the SF6-based estimate is available, and it diverges from the reanalysis data and simulations. Interpretation of the SF6-data-based estimate is limited because of a mesospheric sink of SF6; however, the reanalyses also differ substantially from each other. We conclude that the uncertainty in the mean meridional overturning circulation strength at upper levels of the stratosphere amounts to at least 100\%.},

The northern and southern ``barotropic'' annular modes (the NAM and SAM) have a complex vertical structure. Both are associated with a meridional dipole in clouds between subpolar and middle latitudes, but the sign of the anomalies changes between upper, middle, and lower tropospheric levels. In contrast, the northern and southern baroclinic annular modes have a much simpler vertical structure. Both are linked to same-signed anomalies in clouds extending throughout the troposphere at middle to high latitudes. The changes in cloud incidence associated with both the barotropic and baroclinic annular modes are consistent with dynamical forcing by the attendant changes in static stability and/or vertical motion. The results also provide the first observational estimates of the vertically resolved atmospheric cloud radiative effects associated with hemispheric-scale extratropical variability. In general, the anomalies in atmospheric cloud radiative effects associated with the annular modes peak in the middle to upper troposphere, and are consistent with the anomalous trapping of longwave radiation by variations in upper tropospheric clouds. The southern baroclinic annular mode gives rise to periodic behavior in longwave cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere averaged over Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes.},

  abstract = {The appearance of winter deep mixed layers in the Arctic Ocean under a warming climate is investigated with the HiGEM coupled global climate model. In response to a four times increase of atmospheric \$\$\textbackslash text \{CO\}\_2\$\$levels with respect to present day conditions, the Arctic Basin becomes seasonally ice-free. Its surface becomes consequently warmer and, on average, slightly fresher. Locally, changes in surface salinity can be far larger (up to 4 psu) than the basin-scale average, and of a different sign. The Canadian Basin undergoes a strong freshening, while the Eurasian Basin undergoes strong salinification. These changes are driven by the spin up of the surface circulation, likely resulting from the increased transfer of momentum to the ocean as sea ice cover is reduced. Changes in the surface salinity field also result in a change in stratification, which is strongly enhanced in the Canadian Basin and reduced in the Eurasian Basin. Reduction, or even suppression, of the stratification in the Eurasian Basin produces an environment that is favourable for, and promotes the appearance of, deep convection near the sea ice edge, leading to a significant deepening of winter mixed layers in this region (down to 1000 m). As the Arctic Ocean is transitioning toward a summer ice-free regime, new dynamical ocean processes will appear in the region, with potentially important consequences for the Arctic Ocean itself and for climate, both locally and on larger scales.},

A recent simulation of the LGM climate by a state-of-the-art fully coupled global climate model is shown to exhibit strong, steady atmospheric jets and weak transient eddy activity in the Atlantic sector compared to today's climate. In contrast, previous work based on uncoupled atmospheric model simulations has shown that the LGM jets and eddy activity in the Atlantic sector are similar to those observed today, with the main difference being a northeastward extension of their maxima. The coupled model simulation is shown to agree more with paleoclimate proxy records and thus is taken as the more reliable representation of LGM climate. The existence of this altered atmospheric circulation state during LGM in the model has implications for understanding the stability of glacial climates, for the possibility of multiple atmospheric circulation regimes, and for the interpretation of paleoclimate proxy records.},

This Mudball hypothesis relies on the assumption that sea glacier flow transports dust to the tropical ablation zone, leading to the accumulation of a dust moraine there and consequent lowering of tropical albedo. Here, we use a 1-D sea-glacier flow model to simulate the ice thickness and flow on a globally glaciated Earth, and study the dust transport associated with the ice flow. Dust is entirely confined to a meteoric ice layer which does not exchange water with the ocean. Dust falling onto the surface of this layer is carried downward with the ice flow in extratropical regions, carried equatorward by the global ice flow, and re-emerges on the top of the ice in the tropical ablation zone. The ice flow acts as a dust conveyor belt which converges dust to tropics, resulting in an amplification of effective tropical dust flux by a factor of 2 to 20 over the global average. This lends support to the Mudball hypothesis.},

  abstract = {In the Arctic, the simplest way to describe the winter surface moisture budget (in the absence of any net horizontal transport) is: snow-water-equivalent depth on the ground (D) equals precipitation (P) minus sublimation (S). D, P and S are the most fundamental components of the winter arctic hydrologic cycle and understanding them is essential to understanding arctic moisture-related processes. Unfortunately, accurate solid-precipitation (P) measurements have proven nearly impossible to achieve in the Arctic, because precipitation generally falls when it is windy. Gauge undercatch can range from 55\textendash 75\% depending on the gauge type and wind conditions. The state of knowledge for winter sublimation (S) is even more limited. There are few actual measurements and most studies have used physical models to estimate this quantity. Moreover, fundamental questions concerning the boundary-layer physics of arctic winter sublimation remain unanswered. Resolving these is essential to closing local, regional, and pan-Arctic moisture budgets because some studies indicate sublimation may be as much as 50\% of the total winter precipitation and 35\% of the annual precipitation. This paper summarizes and analyzes the existing literature describing arctic sublimation.},

The domain included rolling uplands and a flat coastal plain. Simulations were produced for the winters of 1994/95, 1995/96, and 1996/97. The model, which accounts for spatial and temporal variations in blowing-snow sublimation, as well as saltation and turbulent-suspended transport, was driven with interpolated fields of observed temperature, humidity, and wind speed and direction. Model outputs include local (a few hundreds of meters) to regional (several tens of kilometers) distributions of winter snow-water-equivalent depths and blowing-snow sublimation losses, from which the regional winter precipitation distributions are computed. At regional scales, the end-of-winter snow depth is largely equal to the difference between winter precipitation and moisture loss due to sublimation. While letting SnowTran-3D simulate the blowing-snow sublimation fluxes, the precipitation fields were determined by forcing the regional variation in model-simulated snow depths to match measured values. Averaged over the entire domain and the three simulation years, the winter precipitation was 17.6 cm, with uplands values averaging 19.0 cm and coastal values averaging 15.3 cm. On average, 21\% of the precipitation was returned to the atmosphere by blowing-snow sublimation, while in the windier coastal regions 34\% of the winter precipitation sublimated.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The relationship between extratropical zonal wind variability and these driving processes is investigated using 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) data. Indices representing the processes (iT and iE) are defined based on vertically integrated diabatic heating and meridional convergence of the meridional flux of zonal momentum by eddies, respectively. Zonal wind signatures associated with these indices are identified via composite analysis. In the Atlantic sector, zonal wind variability is mainly associated with momentum flux convergence by baroclinic eddies, supporting the established view that the Atlantic jet is primarily eddy driven. In the Pacific sector, zonal wind variability is associated with both driving processes, evidence that the Pacific jet is both thermally driven and eddy driven. The thermally driven Pacific signature reflects changes in jet strength (intensity and longitudinal extent) with some resemblance to the zonal wind anomalies of the Pacific\textendash North America (PNA) pattern. The eddy-driven signature reflects a latitudinal shift of the jet exit region in both sectors that resembles the zonal wind anomalies of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) or West Pacific (WP) patterns.},

  abstract = {The advection-condensation (A-C) paradigm is a starting point for a theoretical framework for analysis of atmospheric water vapor distributions and changes therein in a changing climate. It postulates that water vapor concentrations are governed to leading order by the transport through the full four-dimensional temperature (and hence saturation mixing ratio) field. Brewer's (1949) qualitative deduction of the stratospheric circulation based on water vapor measurements was a first and prominently successful application of this paradigm. Here we examine the quantitative validity of the A-C paradigm by predicting stratospheric water vapor based on the saturation mixing ratio at the Lagrangian dry point of trajectories calculated using data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts. Using different data sets for the calculation, we show that results are sensitive to seemingly small differences in temperatures and wind fields and that interpretation of results (in terms of identification of effects of processes deliberately neglected by the advection-condensation paradigm) requires a careful error calculation. We introduce a semiempirical approach to analyze errors in the Lagrangian predictions of water vapor. We show that persistent (in time and space) errors in the temperature fields lead to similar errors in the Lagrangian model predictions. Conversely, biases in the variance of the temperature fields introduces a systematic bias in the model prediction. Further, model predictions are affected by dispersion and the time scale of troposphere-to-stratosphere transport. Our conclusion is that water vapor predictions for the stratospheric overworld based on the A-C paradigm have a dry bias of -40\% {$\pm$} 10\% and -50\% {$\pm$} 10\% when small-space-scale and short-time-scale temperature fluctuations not resolved by the ECMWF reanalyses are taken into account. We suggest that the correction to the A-C paradigm most likely to remove this dry bias is the inclusion of cloud microphysical processes (such as incomplete sedimentation of particles allowing reevaporation), which relax the assumption of instantaneous dehydration to the saturation mixing ratio. Interestingly, the bias attributed to the A-C paradigm in terms of water vapor concentration is found to be proportional to the measured water concentration, and a constant offset in terms of frost point temperature can account for much of the bias and its variability in water vapor mixing ratios.},

  abstract = {Abstract In rapidly rotating planetary atmospheres that are heated from below, equatorial superrotation can occur through convective generation of equatorial Rossby waves. If the heating from below is sufficiently strong that convection penetrates into the upper troposphere, then the convection generates equatorial Rossby waves, which can induce the equatorward angular momentum transport necessary for superrotation. This paper investigates the conditions under which the convective generation of equatorial Rossby waves and their angular momentum transport lead to superrotation. It also addresses how the strength and width of superrotating equatorial jets are controlled. In simulations with an idealized general circulation model (GCM), the relative roles of baroclinicity, heating from below, and bottom drag are explored systematically. Equatorial superrotation generally occurs when the heating from below is sufficiently strong. However, the threshold heating at which the transition to superrotation occurs increases as the baroclinicity or the bottom drag increases. The greater the baroclinicity is, the stronger the angular momentum transport out of low latitudes by baroclinic eddies of extratropical origin. This competes with the angular momentum transport toward the equator by convectively generated Rossby waves and thus can inhibit a transition to superrotation. Equatorial bottom drag damps both the mean zonal flow and convectively generated Rossby waves, weakening the equatorward angular momentum transport as the drag increases; this can also inhibit a transition to superrotation. The strength of superrotating equatorial jets scales approximately with the square of their width. When they are sufficiently strong, their width, in turn, scales with the equatorial Rossby radius and thus depends on the thermal stratification of the equatorial atmosphere. The results have broad implications for planetary atmospheres, particularly for how superrotation can be generated in giant planet atmospheres and in terrestrial atmospheres in warm climates.},

To consider snowmelt and improve regional realism, land surface fluxes are adjusted through a simple energy balance approach at each grid point. This energy adjustment is redistributed over the oceans to ensure energy conservation and maintain realistic global ocean heat uptake, using a weighting function to avoid meridional discontinuities. Calculated surface energy fluxes are evaluated through comparison to ocean reanalyses. Derived turbulent energy flux variability is compared with the Objectively Analyzed air-sea Fluxes (OAFLUX) product, and inferred meridional energy transports in the global ocean and the Atlantic are also evaluated using observations. Uncertainties in surface fluxes are investigated using a variety of approaches including comparison with a range of atmospheric reanalysis products. Decadal changes in the global mean and the interhemispheric energy imbalances are quantified, and present day cross-equator heat transports are reevaluated at 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.15 PW (petawatts) southward by the atmosphere and 0.32 {$\pm$} 0.16 PW northward by the ocean considering the observed ocean heat sinks.},

However, the atmospheric circulation change linked to the reduction of sea ice shows much broader meridional meanders in midlatitudes and clearly different interannual variability than the classical Arctic oscillation. This circulation change results in more frequent episodes of blocking patterns that lead to increased cold surges over large parts of northern continents. Moreover, the increase in atmospheric water vapor content in the Arctic region during late autumn and winter driven locally by the reduction of sea ice provides enhanced moisture sources, supporting increased heavy snowfall in Europe during early winter and the northeastern and midwestern United States during winter. We conclude that the recent decline of Arctic sea ice has played a critical role in recent cold and snowy winters.},

Below this, both forcings tend to give air descending in an equatorward anticyclonic circulation down the isentropes to the west and rising in a similar poleward circulation to the east. However the heating-only response has a strong ascending southwesterly flow that is guided around the south and south-east of the orography when it is included. On the northern side, the westerly flow over the orography gives ascent on the upslope and descent on the downslope.It is found that heating over the Plateau leads to a potential vorticity (PV) minimum and that if it is sufficiently strong the flow is unstable, producing a quasi-biweekly oscillation. During this oscillation the Tibetan anticyclone changes between a single centre over the southwestern side of the Plateau and a split/double structure with centres over China and the Middle East. These characteristics are similar to observed variability in the region. Associated with this quasi-biweekly oscillation are significant variations in the strength of the ascent over the Plateau and the Rossby wave pattern over the North Pacific.The origin of the variability is instability associated with the zonally extended potential vorticity PV minimum on a \texttheta -surface, as proposed by Hsu and Plumb (2000). This minimum is due to the tendency to reduce the PV above the heating over the Plateau and to advection by the consequent anticyclone of high PV around from the east and low PV to the west. The deep convection to the south and southeast of the Plateau tends to suppress the quasi-biweekly oscillation because the low PV produced above it acts to reduce the meridional PV gradient reversal. The occurrence of the oscillation depends on the relative magnitude of the heating in the two regions.},

  abstract = {Abstract Climate response is often assumed to be linear in climate sensitivity studies. However, by examining the surface temperature (TS) response to pairs of oceanic forcings of equal amplitude but opposite sign in a large set of local q-flux perturbation experiments with CAM5 coupled to a slab, we find strong asymmetry in TS responses to the heating and cooling forcings, indicating a strong nonlinearity intrinsic to the climate system examined. Regardless of where the symmetric forcing is placed, the cooling response to the negative forcing always exceeds the warming to the positive forcing, implying an intrinsic inclination toward cooling of our current climate. Thus, the ongoing global warming induced by increasing greenhouse gases may have already been alleviated by the asymmetric component of the response. The common asymmetry in TS response peaks in high latitudes, especially along sea ice edges, with notable seasonal dependence. Decomposition into different radiative feedbacks through a radiative kernel indicates that the asymmetry in the TS response is realized largely through lapse rate and albedo feedbacks. Further process interference experiments disabling the seasonal cycle and/or sea ice reveal that the asymmetry originates ultimately from the presence of the sea ice component and is further amplified by the seasonal cycle. The fact that a pair of opposite tropical q-flux forcings can excite very similar asymmetric response as a pair placed at 55\textdegree S strongly suggests the asymmetric response is a manifestation of an internal mode of the climate model system.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The aim of this paper is to study the impacts of overshooting convection at a local scale on the water distribution in the tropical UTLS. Overshooting convection is assumed to be one of the processes controlling the entry of water vapour mixing ratio in the stratosphere by injecting ice crystals above the tropopause which later sublimate and hydrate the lower stratosphere. For this purpose, we quantify the individual impact of two cases of overshooting convection in Africa observed during SCOUT-AMMA: the case of 4 August 2006 over Southern Chad which is likely to have influenced the water vapour measurements by micro-SDLA and FLASH-B from Niamey on 5 August, and the case of a mesoscale convective system over A\"ir on 5 August 2006. We make use of high resolution (down to 1 km horizontally) nested grid simulations with the three-dimensional regional atmospheric model BRAMS (Brazilian Regional Atmospheric Modelling System). In both cases, BRAMS succeeds in simulating the main features of the convective activity, as well as overshooting convection, though the exact position and time of the overshoots indicated by MSG brightness temperature difference is not fully reproduced (typically 1\textdegree{} displacement in latitude compared with the overshoots indicated by brightness temperature difference from satellite observations for both cases, and several hours shift for the A\"ir case on 5 August 2006). Total water budgets associated with these two events show a significant injection of ice particles above the tropopause with maximum values of about 3.7 ton s\textsuperscript{-1} for the Chad case (4 August) and 1.4 ton s\textsuperscript{-1} for the A\"ir case (5 August), and a total upward cross tropopause transport of about 3300 ton h\textsuperscript{-1} for the Chad case and 2400 ton h\textsuperscript{-1} for the A\"ir case in the third domain of simulation. The order of magnitude of these modelled fluxes is lower but comparable with similar studies in other tropical areas based on models. These two estimations exhibit significant differences and highlight variability among the cases of the impact of overshooting convection in hydrating the lower stratosphere. We show that the regional enhancement of water above the tropopause is between 0.21 to 0.67 ppmv between 380 and 400 K, generally in the range of other model estimations. The amount of water which remains in the stratosphere after the overshoot is estimated for both cases. A range of 330 to 507 tons is found for the Chad case and an upper limit of 200 tons is found for the A\"ir case. Finally we emphasize that the hydrated area in the LS by overshooting convection can be advected relatively far away from the overshoot initial location, with locally mixing ratios of more than 3 ppmv higher than the background level, which is compatible with the balloon borne measurements performed above Niamey in the same air mass, 30 h after the overshoot.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

It is clear that these changes include global-wide increases in mean surface temperature and changes in temperature variance that are more regionally-dependent1\textendash 3. It is less clear whether they also include changes in the persistence of surface temperature. This is important as the effects of weather events on ecosystems and society depend critically on the length of the event. Here we provide an extensive survey of the response of surface temperature persistence to climate change over the twenty-first century~from the output of 150 simulations run on four different Earth system models, and from simulations run on simplified models with varying representations of radiative processes and large-scale dynamics. Together, the results indicate that climate change simulations are marked by widespread changes in surface temperature persistence that are generally most robust over ocean areas and arise due to a seemingly broad range of physical processes. The findings point to both the robustness of widespread changes in persistence under climate change, and the critical need to better understand, simulate and constrain such changes.},

  abstract = {Enceladus is believed to have a saltwater global ocean, heated at the ocean\textendash core interface and losing heat to the floating ice shell above. This configuration suggests an important role for vertical convection. The ice shell has dramatic meridional thickness variations that, in steady state, must be sustained by the ocean circulation against processes acting to remove these anomalies. This could be achieved through spatially separated regions of freezing and melting at the ocean\textendash ice interface. Here, we use an idealized, dynamical ocean model forced by an observationally guided density flux at the ocean\textendash ice interface to argue that Enceladus's interior ocean should support a meridional overturning circulation. This circulation establishes an interior density structure that is more complex than in studies that have focused only on vertical convection, including a shallow freshwater lens in the polar regions. Spatially separated sites of ice formation and melt enable Enceladus to sustain significant vertical and horizontal stratification, which influences interior heat transport and is critical for understanding the relationship between a global ocean and the planetary energy budget. On the basis of our model, the presence of low salinity layers near the polar ocean\textendash ice interface implies the ocean's bulk salinity could substantially exceed values inferred from Cassini plume samples.},

A test problem is considered in which exact, explicit analytical solutions are found by using a form for the saturation specific humidity that closely models that for Earth's atmosphere. Simple equations for the conservation of mass, energy, and moisture are solved with a new type of weak solution, where the fluid satisfies Lagrangian versions of these equations. A numerical method using a Lagrangian-based hard convective adjustment step calculates solutions which converge to the analytical solutions as the vertical mesh size decreases, and is stable in time. When the thermodynamic paths followed by an ascending and descending parcel do not overlap in a potential temperature\textendash pressure diagram, steady equilibrium solutions are found; otherwise, non-equilibrium behaviour of the numerical solution occurs.

Nearly ubiquitous negative biases in surface alkalinity result from the prescribed carbonate dissolution profile. The modeled sea\textendash air CO2 fluxes match observationally based estimates over much of the ocean; significant deviations appear in the Southern Ocean. Surface ocean pCO2 is biased high in the subantarctic and low in the sea ice zone. Formation of the water masses dominating anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) uptake in the Southern Hemisphere is weak in the model, leading to significant negative biases in Cant and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) storage at intermediate depths. Column inventories of Cant appear too high, by contrast, in the North Atlantic. In spite of the positive bias, this marks an improvement over prior versions of the model, which underestimated North Atlantic uptake. The change in behavior is attributable to a new parameterization of density-driven overflows. CESM1(BGC) provides a relatively robust representation of the ocean\textendash carbon cycle response to climate variability. Statistical metrics of modeled interannual variability in sea\textendash air CO2 fluxes compare reasonably well to observationally based estimates. The carbon cycle response to key modes of climate variability is basically similar in the coupled and forced ocean-ice models; however, the two differ in regional detail and in the strength of teleconnections.},

Historically, largely independent approaches have been used to represent boundary layer turbulence and convection, neglecting important interactions at the subgrid scale. Here we build on an eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme that represents all subgrid-scale mixing in a unified manner, partitioning subgrid-scale fluctuations into contributions from local diffusive mixing and coherent advective structures and allowing them to interact within a single framework. The EDMF scheme requires closures for the interaction between the turbulent environment and the plumes and for local mixing. A second-order equation for turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) provides one ingredient for the diffusive local mixing closure, leaving a mixing length to be parameterized. Here, we propose a new mixing length formulation, based on constraints derived from the TKE balance. It expresses local mixing in terms of the same physical processes in all regimes of boundary layer flow. The formulation is tested at a range of resolutions and across a wide range of boundary layer regimes, including a stably stratified boundary layer, a stratocumulus-topped marine boundary layer, and dry convection. Comparison with large eddy simulations (LES) shows that the EDMF scheme with this diffusive mixing parameterization accurately captures the structure of the boundary layer and clouds in all cases considered.},

Anomalous baroclinic wave activity is generated at the latitude of anomalous temperature gradient that, by thermal wind, coincides with the latitude of the anomalous zonal jet. The net propagation of baroclinic wave activity away from the jet gives momentum fluxes into the jet.

It is found that positive zonal wind anomalies in the eastern tropical Pacific lead to above-normal precipitation in northwest Mexico and Arizona from several days to over a week later. This connection between the tropical Pacific and monsoon precipitation appears to be limited to regions influenced by moisture surges from the Gulf of California as a similar connection does not exist for New Mexico precipitation. The evidence suggests that the MJO might affect monsoon precipitation by modulating the strength of low-level easterly waves off the coast of Mexico, which in turn triggers the development of a gulf surge.},

  abstract = {Abstract Variations of weather and climate are termed ``forced'' or ``free'' according to whether or not they are produced by variations in external conditions. In many simple climate models, the poleward transport of sensible heat in the atmosphere has been treated as a diffusive process, and has been assumed to be proportional to the poleward temperature gradient. The validity of this assumption, for various space and time scales, is tested with 10 years of twice-daily upper level weather data. The space scales are defined by a spherical harmonic analysis, while the time scales are defined by a ``poor man's spectral analysis.'' The diffusive assumption is verified for the long-term average and the seasonal variations of the largest space scale, but it fails to hold for most of the remaining scales. It is shown that diffusive behavior can be expected only for forced scales. It is suggested that most of the scales resolved by the data are free.},

These statistical forecasts are computed using logistic regression with cross validation. While recent precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture do provide skillful forecasts, it is found that additional information on the current state of the USDM adds significant skill to the forecasts. The USDM state information takes the form of a metric that quantifies the ``distance'' from the next-higher drought category using a nondiscrete estimate of the current USDM state. This adds skill because USDM states that are close to the next-higher drought category are more likely to intensify than states that are farther from this threshold. The method shows skill over most of the United States but is most skillful over the north-central United States, where the cross-validated Brier skill score averages 0.20 for both 2- and 4-week forecasts. The 8-week forecasts are less skillful in most locations. The 2- and 4-week probabilities have very good reliability. The 8-week probabilities, on the other hand, are noticeably overconfident. For individual drought events, the method shows the most skill when forecasting high-amplitude flash droughts and when large regions of the United States are experiencing intensifying drought.},

  abstract = {Abstract The U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) classifies drought into five discrete dryness/drought categories based on expert synthesis of numerous data sources. In this study, an empirical methodology is presented for creating a nondiscrete USDM index that simultaneously 1) represents the dryness/wetness value on a continuum and 2) is most consistent with the time scales and processes of the actual USDM. A continuous USDM representation will facilitate USDM forecasting methods, which will benefit from knowledge of where, within a discrete drought class, the current drought state most probably lies. The continuous USDM is developed such that the actual discrete USDM can be reconstructed by discretizing the continuous USDM based on the 30th, 20th, 10th, 5th, and 2nd percentiles\textemdash corresponding with USDM definitions for the D4\textendash D0 drought classes. Anomalies in precipitation, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration over a range of different time scales are used as predictors to estimate the continuous USDM. The methodology is fundamentally probabilistic, meaning that the probability density function (PDF) of the continuous USDM is estimated and therefore the degree of uncertainty in the fit is properly characterized. Goodness-of-fit metrics and direct comparisons between the actual and predicted USDM analyses during different seasons and years indicate that this objective drought classification method is well correlated with the current USDM analyses. In Part II, this continuous USDM index will be used to improve intraseasonal USDM intensification forecasts because it is capable of distinguishing between USDM states that are either far from or near to the next-higher drought category.},

The forecasts use the current land surface conditions and numerical weather prediction forecasts from the Subseasonal to Seasonal (S2S) Prediction project. Changes in soil moisture are quite predictable 8\textendash 14 days in advance with 50\% or more of the variance explained over the majority of the contiguous United States; however, changes in ESI are significantly less predictable. A simple red noise model of predictability shows that the spatial variations in forecast skill are primarily a result of variations in the autocorrelation, or persistence, of the predicted variable, especially for the ESI. The difference in overall skill between soil moisture and ESI, on the other hand, is due to the greater soil moisture predictability by the numerical model forecasts. As the forecast lead time increases from 8\textendash 14 to 15\textendash 28 days, however, the autocorrelation dominates the soil moisture and ESI differences as well. An analysis of modeled transpiration, and bare soil and canopy water evaporation contributions to total evaporation, suggests improvements to the ESI forecasts can be achieved by estimating the relative contributions of these components to the initial ESI state. The importance of probabilistic forecasts for reproducing the correct probability of anomaly intensification is also shown.},

The percent increase in precipitation per temperature increase is smallest during the warm season when energy constraints on the hydrological cycle are more important. In contrast to other hydrological quantities, the changes in evaporation in the extratropics are not explained well by the temperature or zonal wind change. Instead, a significant portion of the intermodel spread of evaporation change is linked to the spread in the poleward ocean heat transport change.},

A Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) model is used to separate the relative roles because the static stability in a QG model is externally prescribed and can therefore be altered independently of the meridional temperature gradient. For most experiments, the changes in meridional temperature gradients make the largest contribution to the zonal-mean zonal wind (U) changes, although the static stability changes are also important. In most cases, the mechanism for the static stability response does not directly involve the eddies. Instead, the advection of the static stability perturbation by the zonal-mean vertical velocity accounts for most of the U response to static stability. For increased static stability, advection by the Ferrel cell increases the meridional temperature gradient, which strengthens the jet via thermal wind. The stronger jet then shifts poleward, consistent with various theories in the literature. For Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE), the direct effect of static stability makes a non-negligible contribution in most cases, however, the meridional temperature gradient and advection by Ferrel cell effects together are usually more dominant.},

The northern hemisphere is found to contain two homogeneous zones, one in the polar regions and one in the subtropics, such that pressures in one zone tend to be correlated positively with other pressures in the same zone and negatively with pressures in the other zone. Considerable difference is found between the seasonal and the irregular pressure-variations which result from mass transport across the equator, but the seasonal and the irregular variations of pressure differences resemble each other closely, as do the seasonal and the irregular pressure-variations which result from rearrangements of mass within the northern hemisphere. The most important rearrangements appear to consist of shifts of mass from one homogeneous zone to the other. These shifts seem to be essentially the same as fluctuations between high-index and low-index patterns. The study thus supports previous conclusions that such fluctuations form the principal variations of the general circulation, and also shows that, except at low latitudes, the seasonal pressure-variations are essentially fluctuations of this sort. The possibility that the seasonal and the irregular variations have similar ultimate or immediate causes is considered.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The change in zonal jets is also accompanied by a strengthening and a poleward and upward shift of transient kinetic energy and momentum flux. Similar changes in circulation are simulated by a simple dry general circulation model (GCM) when the height of the tropopause is raised. The similarity between the simple GCM and the IPCC models suggests that the changes in midlatitude circulation are predominantly driven by a rise in the height of the tropopause, and that other factors such as increased moisture content and the change in the low-level pole-to-equator temperature gradient, play a secondary role. In addition, the variability about the ensemble-mean of the zonal wind response is significantly correlated with the variability of the tropopause height response over the polar cap, especially in the Southern Hemisphere.},

Given the background zonal-mean flow and the space\textendash time structure of the baroclinic wave activity source, RWC calculates the space\textendash time structure of the upper-tropospheric u{$\upsilon$}. RWC allows a clean separation of the effects of phase speed changes and index of refraction changes (i.e., changes in background flow) on u{$\upsilon$}. It is found that u{$\upsilon$} reinforces imposed zonal-mean zonal wind (u) anomalies that are collocated with the centers of action of the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF1) of the GCM. Critical-level dynamics are essential for the positive feedback when u is equatorward of the mean jet, and ``reflecting level'' dynamics are essential for the positive feedback when u is poleward of the jet. The eddy momentum flux caused by changes in the phase speeds of the wave sources, on the other hand, are associated with a negative feedback. When the imposed u is out of phase with EOF1, the eddies tend to shift the imposed u poleward (equatorward) for anomalies that are equatorward (poleward) of the poleward center of action of EOF1. Critical (reflecting)-level dynamics is most important for the poleward shift in the subtropics (midlatitudes). Because there are no baroclinic feedbacks in these experiments, these results suggest that barotropic feedbacks alone can account for the structure of the u variability in the midlatitudes.},

RWC is used to diagnose and understand the poleward shift of the jet in an idealized GCM using the convergence of the vertical EP flux in the upper troposphere as the wave activity source. The poleward-shifted jet is maintained via a selective ``reflecting level'' on the poleward flank of jet: for a given wavenumber, low phase speed waves are reflected but high phase speed waves are absorbed at the critical level on the poleward flank of jet. When the zonal-mean zonal wind increases on the poleward flank of the jet, a wider range of poleward-propagating waves encounter a reflecting level instead of a critical level on the poleward flank. The increased wave reflection leads to increased equatorward-propagating waves (and, therefore, poleward momentum flux) across the jet. Increases in wave phase speeds directly oppose the poleward shift because, in addition to the well-recognized effect of phase speed on wave dissipation in the subtropics, increased phase speeds imply more wave dissipation rather than reflection on the poleward flank via the selective reflecting level.},

The geological record reads that liquid water was always present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however, the Earth's radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least 30\% and possibly 100\%. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth's radiation balance. It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence of life. This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for the biosphere has persisted ever since.

  abstract = {The interest in understanding the climate-life system that has fostered the Gaia hypothesis (GH) has resulted in multiple explanatory theories, making its status unclear and controversial. This work seeks to bring some clarity to the debates surrounding the GH with the aim to make it amenable to scientific scrutiny. We discuss what it means to take the GH at face value and its implications for a potential research programme we call `functional climatology'. The evolutionary origin of language remains unknown despite many efforts to determine the origin of this signature human trait. Based on epigenetic inheritance, the current article hypothesizes that language evolved from cell-cell communication as the basis for generating structure and function embryologically and phylogenetically, as did all physiologic traits. Beginning with lipids forming the first micelle, a vertical integration of the evolved properties of the cell, from multicellular organisms to the introduction of cholesterol into the cell membrane, to the evolution of the peroxisome, the water-land transition and duplication of the {$\beta$}Adrenergic Receptor, the evolution of endothermy, leading to bipedalism, freeing the forelimbs for toolmaking and language, selection pressure for myelinization of the central nervous system to facilitate calcium flux, bespeaks human expression, culminating in the evolution of civilization. This process is epitomized by the Area of Broca as the structural-functional site for both motor control and language formation. The mechanistic interrelationship between motor control and language formation is underscored by the role of FoxP2 gene expression in both bipedalism and language. The effect of endothermy on bipedalism, freeing the forelimbs for toolmaking and language as the vertical integration from Cosmology to Physiology as the basis for language bespeaks human expression. All SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) programmes that were conceived and put into practice since the 1960s have been based on anthropocentric ideas concerning the definition of intelligence on a cosmic-wide scale. Brain-based neuronal intelligence, augmented by AI, are currently thought of as being the only form of intelligence that can engage in SETI-type interactions, and this assumption is likely to be connected with the dilemma of the famous Fermi paradox. We argue that high levels of intelligence and cognition inherent in ensembles of bacteria are much more likely to be the dominant form of cosmic intelligence, and the transfer of such intelligence is enabled by the processes of panspermia. We outline the main principles of bacterial intelligence, and how this intelligence may be used by the planetary-scale bacterial system, or the bacteriosphere, through processes of biological tropism, to connect to any extra-terrestrial microbial forms, independently of human interference. The Gaia hypothesis states that the Earth is an instance of life. However, appraisals of it tend to focus on the claim that life is a feedback self-regulator that controls Earth's chemistry and climate dynamics, yet, self-regulation by feedbacks is not a definitive characteristic of living systems. Here, we consider the characterization of biological systems as autopoietic systems (causally organized to self-produce through metabolic efficient closure) and then ask whether the Gaia hypothesis is a tractable question from this standpoint. A proof-of-concept based on Chemical Organization Theory (COT) and the Zero Deficiency Theorem (ZDT) applied on a simple but representative Earth's molecular reaction network supports the thesis of Gaia as an autopoietic system. We identify the formation of self-producing organizations within the reaction network, corresponding to recognizable scenarios of Earth's history. These results provide further opportunities to discuss how the instantiation of autopoiesis at the planetary scale could manifests central features of biological phenomenon, such as autonomy and anticipation, and what this implies for the further development of the Gaia theory, Earth's climate modelling and geoengineering. Ancient tsunamiites potentially present information about cosmic, global, and regional events and processes, including the dynamics of the galaxy, the solar system, the Earth, and regions on Earth. Investigation of impact tsunamiites is particularly significant for global studies of the Earth's past; therefore, the present contribution is focused on this specific type, while ancient volcanism and slide-induced tsunamiites are not dealt with in detail. The occurrence of tsunamiites reflects the occurrence patterns in time of tsunamis, including the frequency of impact-induced tsunamis and the recurrence rate of earthquake-induced tsunamis. This may help to find out records of ancient tsunamis. For example, a high frequency of impact tsunamiites between 1.5 and 1.9 Ga is expected because of the meteorite-impact periodicity that has been proposed on the basis of impact craters. Earthquake-induced tsunamis reflect global and regional tectonics such as plume tectonics, plate-subduction tectonics, and ridge subduction and tend to occur with higher frequencies during sea-level rise than during sea-level fall. As far as studies of the pre-Quaternary are concerned, submarine tsunamiites are more important than the run-up tsunamiites on land, because of their preservation potential. It is suggested that the possibility is relatively high to find tsunamiites in bays and shallow seas. Tsunami-induced sediment gravity-flow deposits as those of the Mediterranean homogenite-type deposits may be found much more often in prehistorical and older sedimentary records than has previously been expected.},

  abstract = {The IPCC AR4 global warming climate simulations reveal a pronounced seasonality of polar warming amplification with maximum warming amplification in winter and minimum in summer. In this paper, we study the relative importance of surface albedo feedback (SAF), changes in cloud radiative forcing (CRF), changes in surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, changes in heat storage, and changes in the clear-sky downward infrared radiation in causing the strong seasonality of polar warming amplification by calculating partial temperature changes due to each of these processes using the surface energy budget equation. The main thermodynamic factor for a small polar warming amplification in summer is that the positive SAF is largely cancelled out by the negative surface CRF feedback in summer. The positive SAF is relatively much weaker in winter compared to its amplitude in summer, therefore does not contribute to the pronounced polar warming amplification in winter. The seasonal cycle of polar surface warming amplification, in terms of both spatial patterns and temporal amplitude, closely follows the seasonal cycle of the warming due to changes in clear-sky downward longwave radiation alone, indicating the importance of the atmospheric processes, such as water vapor feedback and dynamical feedbacks associated with the enhancement of poleward moist static energy transport, in causing the pronounced seasonality of polar warming amplification.},

Despite clear evidence of these impacts, the principal mechanism whereby stratospheric variability influences tropospheric circulation has remained elusive. Here, the authors introduce a novel approach, based on the theory of finite-amplitude wave activity, for quantifying the role of adiabatic and nonconservative effects on the mean flow that shape the downward coupling from the stratosphere to the troposphere during stratospheric vortex weakening (SVW) events. The advantage of using this theory is that eddy effects (at finite amplitude) on the mean flow can be more readily distinguished from nonconservative effects.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The results show (in confirmation of previous work) that the downward migration of extratropical wind anomalies is largely attributable to dynamical adjustments induced by fluctuating finite-amplitude wave forcing. The nonconservative effects, on the other hand, contribute to maintaining the downward signals in the recovery stage within the stratosphere, hinting at the importance of mixing and diabatic heating. The analysis further indicates that variations in stratospheric finite-amplitude wave forcing are too weak to account for the attendant changes and shapes in the tropospheric flow. It is suggested that the indirect effect of tropospheric finite-amplitude wave activity through the residual displacements is needed to amplify and prolong the tropospheric wind responses over several weeks. The results also reveal that the local tropospheric wave activity over the North Pacific and North Atlantic sectors plays a significant role in shaping the high-latitude tropospheric wind response to SVW events.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Time series of 1-Hz vertical velocity data collected during aircraft penetrations of oceanic cumulonimbus clouds over the western Pacific warm pool as part of the Equatorial Mesoscale Experiment (EMEX) are analyzed for updraft and downdraft events called cores. An updraft core is defined as occurring whenever the vertical velocity exceeds 1 m s-1 for at least 500 m. A downdraft core is defined analogously. Over 19 000 km of straight and level flight legs are used in the analysis. Five hundred eleven updraft cores and 253 downdraft cores are included in the dataset. Core properties are summarized as distributions of average and maximum vertical velocity, diameter, and mass flux in four altitude intervals between 0.2 and 5.8 km. Distributions are approximately lognormal at all levels. Examination of the variation of the statistics with height suggests a maximum in vertical velocity between 2 and 3 km; slightly lower or equal vertical velocity is indicated at 5 km. Near the freezing level, virtual temperature deviations are found to be slightly positive for both updraft and downdraft cores. The excess in updraft cores is much smaller than that predicted by parcel theory. Comparisons with other studies that use the same analysis technique reveal that EMEX cores have approximately the same strength as cores of other oceanic areas, despite warmer sea surface temperatures. Diameter and mass flux are greater than those in GATE but smaller than those in hurricane rainbands. Oceanic cores are much weaker and appear to be slightly smaller than those observed over land during the Thunderstorm Project. The markedly weaker oceanic vertical velocities below 5.8 km (compared to the continental cores) cannot be attributed to smaller total convective available potential energy or to very high water loading. Rather, the authors suggest that water loading, although less than adiabatic, is more effective in reducing buoyancy of oceanic cores because of the smaller potential buoyancy below 5.8 km. Entrainment appears to be more effective in reducing buoyancy to well below adiabatic values in oceanic cores, a result consistent with the smaller oceanic core diameters in the lower cloud layer. It is speculated further that core diameters are related to boundary layer depth, which is clearly smaller over the oceans.},

  abstract = {Abstract Systematic sensitivity of the jet position and intensity to horizontal model resolution is identified in several aquaplanet AGCMs, with the coarser resolution producing a more equatorward eddy-driven jet and a stronger upper-tropospheric jet intensity. As the resolution of the models increases to 50 km or finer, the jet position and intensity show signs of convergence within each model group. The mechanism for this convergence behavior is investigated using a hybrid Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian finite-amplitude wave activity budget developed for the upper-tropospheric absolute vorticity. The results suggest that the poleward shift of the eddy-driven jet with higher resolution can be attributed to the smaller effective diffusivity of the model in the midlatitudes that allows more wave activity to survive the dissipation and to reach the subtropical critical latitude for wave breaking. The enhanced subtropical wave breaking and associated irreversible vorticity mixing act to maintain a more poleward peak of the vorticity gradient, and thus a more poleward jet. Being overdissipative, the coarse-resolution AGCMs misrepresent the nuanced nonlinear aspect of the midlatitude eddy\textendash mean flow interaction, giving rise to the equatorward bias of the eddy-driven jet. In accordance with the asymptotic behavior of effective diffusivity of Batchelor turbulence in the large Peclet number limit, the upper-tropospheric effective diffusivity of the aquaplanet AGCMs displays signs of convergence in the midlatitude toward a value of approximately 107 m2 s-1 for the {$\nabla$}2 diffusion. This provides a dynamical underpinning for the convergence of the jet stream observed in these AGCMs at high resolution.},

The dry-versus-wet disparity in the transient hydrological cycle is measured by , and it is found to increase at a super-Clausius\textendash Clapeyron rate at the poleward side of the mean storm track in response to a uniform sea surface temperature (SST) warming and the meridional structure of the increase can be largely attributed to the change of the meridional stirring scale of the midlatitude Rossby waves. Further scaling for indicates that the rate of the wavy hydrological cycle, measured by the ratio of to the CWV wave activity, is subdued almost everywhere in the extratropics, implying an overall weakening of the transient circulation. Extending the CWV wave activity analysis to the transient moist regions helps reveal some unique characteristics of atmospheric rivers in terms of transport function, minimum precipitation efficiency, and maximum hydrological cycle rate, as well as an overall weakening of the hydrological cycle rate in the atmospheric river regions under SST warming.},

For example, at a relative humidity of 80\%, the Heat Index is only defined for temperatures in the range of 288-304 K (59-88 degrees Fahrenheit). Here, Steadman's thermoregulation model is extended to define the Heat Index for all combinations of temperature and humidity, allowing for an assessment of Earth's future habitability. The extended Heat Index can be mapped onto physiological responses of an idealized human, such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and even heat death, providing an indication of regional health outcomes for different degrees of global warming.},

The formulation of the CFRAM is based on the energy balance in an atmosphere\textendash surface column. In the CFRAM, the isolation of partial temperature changes due to an external forcing or an individual feedback is achieved by solving the linearized infrared radiation transfer model subject to individual energy flux perturbations (external or due to feedbacks). The partial temperature changes are addable and their sum is equal to the (total) temperature change (in the linear sense). The decomposition of feedbacks is based on the thermodynamic and dynamical processes that directly affect individual energy flux terms. Therefore, not only those feedbacks that directly affect the TOA radiative fluxes, such as water vapor, clouds, and ice-albedo feedbacks, but also those feedbacks that do not directly affect the TOA radiation, such as evaporation, convections, and convergence of horizontal sensible and latent heat fluxes, are explicitly included in the CFRAM. In the CFRAM, the feedback gain matrices measure the strength of individual feedbacks. The feedback gain matrices can be estimated from the energy flux perturbations inferred from individual parameterization packages and dynamical modules. The inter-model spread of a feedback gain matrix would help us to detect the origins of the uncertainty of future climate projections in climate model simulations.},

It is found that the topography term can be included explicitly in the blocking evolution equation because of the inclusion of the higher-order wave\textendash topography interaction. Although the blocking flow cannot be excited purely by the LSC topography, the LSC topography is found to be capable of enhancing the amplification of the dipole component in a blocking flow associated with upstream synoptic-scale eddies. In this case, a strong omega-type blocking high can be driven by the joint action of synoptic-scale eddies and LSC topography. This seems to provide an explanation of a difference in blocking intensity between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The most important finding of this paper is that in the presence of LSC topography the double jets that appear during the onset of an eddy-driven dipole block collapse into a strong single westerly jet that is within the south side of an omega-type blocking high, which is different from the result predicted by the theoretical model proposed in Luo's previous work.},

The new climate feedback analysis method formulated in Lu and Cai (Clim Dyn 32:873\textendash 885, 2009) is used to isolate contributions from both radiative and non-radiative feedback processes to the total temperature change obtained with the coupled GCM. These partial temperature changes are additive and their sum is convergent to the total temperature change. The radiative energy flux perturbations due to the doubling of CO2 and water vapor feedback lead to a stronger warming in low latitudes than in high latitudes at the surface and throughout the entire troposphere. In the vertical, the temperature changes due to the doubling of CO2 and water vapor feedback are maximum near the surface and decrease with height at all latitudes. The simultaneous warming reduction in low latitudes and amplification in high latitudes by the enhanced poleward dry static energy transport reverses the poleward decreasing warming pattern at the surface and in the lower troposphere, but it is not able to do so in the upper troposphere. The enhanced vertical moist convection in the tropics acts to amplify the warming in the upper troposphere at an expense of reducing the warming in the lower troposphere and surface warming in the tropics. As a result, the final warming pattern shows the co-existence of a reduction of the meridional temperature gradient at the surface and in the lower troposphere with an increase of the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere. In the tropics, the total warming in the upper troposphere is stronger than the surface warming.},

  abstract = {Abstract The fluctuation\textendash dissipation theorem (FDT) provides a means of calculating the response of a dynamical system to a small force by constructing a linear operator that depends only on data from the internal variability of the unperturbed system. Here the FDT is used to estimate the response of a two-layer quasigeostrophic model to two zonally symmetric torques, both barotropic, with the same sign of the forcing in the two layers, and baroclinic, with opposite sign forcing in the two layers. The supercriticality of the model is also varied to test how the FDT fares, as this parameter is varied. To perform the FDT calculations the data are decomposed onto empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and only those EOFs that are well resolved are retained in the FDT calculations. In the barotropic case good qualitative estimates are obtained for all values of the supercriticality, though the FDT consistently overestimates the response, perhaps because of significant non-Gaussian behavior present in the model. Nevertheless, this adds to the evidence that the annular-mode time scale plays an important role in determining the response of the midlatitudes to small perturbations. The baroclinic case is more challenging for the FDT. However, by constructing different bases with which to calculate the EOFs, it is shown that the issue in this case is that the baroclinic variability is poorly sampled, not that the FDT fails. The strategies developed in order to generate these estimates may be applicable to situations in which the FDT is applied to larger systems.},

Strong relationships are found between the monthly and interannual variability of tropical clouds, and the tropical net cloud feedback. These relationships are combined with observations to substantially narrow the uncertainty in the tropical cloud feedback and demonstrate that the tropical cloud feedback is likely {$>$}0Wm-2K-1. Promising relationships are also found in the 90\textdegree\textendash 60\textdegree S and 30\textdegree\textendash 60\textdegree N regions, though these relationships are not robust across model generations and we have not identified the associated physical mechanisms.},

Here, a moist energy balance model is used to evaluate several SRM proposals, providing fundamental insight into how the insolation reduction profile affects the climate response. The optimal SRM profile is found to depend on the intensity of the intervention, as the most effective profile for moderate SRM focuses the reduction at high latitudes, whereas the most effective profile for strong SRM is tropically amplified. The effectiveness of SRM is also shown to depend on when it is applied, an important factor to consider when designing SRM proposals.

Using a combination of theory, idealized modeling work, and simulations with a comprehensive climate model, it is shown that large-scale orography reduces upstream temperature gradients, in turn reducing upstream temperature variability, and enhances downstream temperature gradients, enhancing downstream temperature variability. Hence, the presence of the Rockies on the western edge of the North American continent increases temperature gradients over North America and, consequently, increases North American temperature variability. By contrast, the presence of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayas on the eastern edge of the Eurasian continent damps temperature variability over most of Eurasia. However, Tibet and the Himalayas also interfere with the downstream development of storms in the North Pacific storm track, and thus damp temperature variability over North America, by approximately as much as the Rockies enhance it. Large-scale orography is also shown to impact the skewness of downstream temperature distributions, as temperatures to the north of the enhanced temperature gradients are more positively skewed while temperatures to the south are more negatively skewed. This effect is most clearly seen in the northwest Pacific, off the east coast of Japan.},

A particularly urgent question is how {$\epsilon$} will change in warmer climates. To address these issues, this study investigates the precipitation efficiency in simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium with a cloud-resolving model forced by a wide range of sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Two different domains are considered: a small, doubly periodic domain, and a 2-D (x-z) ``mock-Walker'' domain with a sinusoidal SST profile that resembles the equatorial Pacific, and the sensitivities of the results to the microphysical scheme and to the horizontal resolution are also explored. It is found that {$\epsilon$} generally increases with warming in the small domain simulations because of increases in the efficiency with which cloud condensate is converted into precipitation, with changes in the re-evaporation of falling precipitation playing a secondary role. This picture is complicated in the 2-D simulations by substantial changes in the degree of convective organization as the underlying SSTs are varied. {$\epsilon$} is found to decrease as convection becomes more organized, because convective organization results in relatively more low clouds, which have small ({$\leq$}0.1) precipitation efficiencies, and relatively less high clouds, which have larger ({$\sim$}0.4) precipitation efficiencies.},

As a first step to understanding these contributions, this study investigates simulations with an idealized general circulation model in which the gradients are eliminated individually or jointly, while keeping the global means fixed. The insolation gradient has a larger influence on the model's climate than the gradient in optical depth, but both make sizeable contributions and the changes are largest when the gradients are reduced simultaneously. Removing either gradient increases global-mean surface temperature due to an increase in the tropospheric lapse rate, while the meridional surface temperature gradients are reduced. ``Global warming'' experiments with these configurations suggest similar climate sensitivities; however, the warming patterns and feedbacks are quite different. Changes in the meridional energy fluxes lead to polar amplification of the response in all but the setup in which both gradients are removed. The lapse-rate feedback acts to polar amplify the responses in the Earth-like setup, but is uniformly negative in the other setups. Simple models are used to interpret the results, including a prognostic model that can accurately predict regional surface temperatures, given the meridional distributions of insolation and longwave optical depths.},

To document this structure, the EMFs in the lower tropospheres of a two-layer quasigeostrophic model, a primitive equation model, and the Southern Hemisphere of a reanalysis dataset are investigated. The lower-tropospheric EMFs are very similar in the cores of the jets in both models and the reanalysis data, with EMF divergence (opposing the upper-tropospheric convergence) due to relatively long waves with slow eastward phase speeds and EMF divergence (as in the upper troposphere) due to shorter waves with faster eastward phase speeds. As the two-layer model is able to capture the EMF divergence by long waves, a qualitative picture of the underlying dynamics is proposed that relies on the negative potential vorticity gradient in the lower layer of the model. Eddies excited by baroclinic instability mix efficiently through a wide region in the lower layer, centered on the latitude of maximum westerlies and encompassing the lower-layer critical latitudes. Near these critical latitudes, the mixing is enhanced, resulting in increased EMF convergence, with compensating EMF divergence in the center of the jet. The EMF convergence at faster phase speeds is due to deep eddies that propagate on the upper-tropospheric potential vorticity gradient.},

Southward OHT by the cross-equatorial cells is caused by Ekman flow driven by southwesterly monsoon winds in the summer months, cooling sea surface temperatures (SSTs) south of the continent. This increases the reversed meridional surface gradient of moist static energy, shifting the precipitation maximum over the land and strengthening the monsoonal circulation, in the sense of enhancing the vertical wind shear. However, the atmosphere's cross-equatorial meridional overturning circulation is also weakened by the presence of southward OHT, as the atmosphere is required to transport less energy across the equator. The sensitivity of these effects to varying the strength of the OHT, fixing the OHT at its annual-mean value, and to removing the land is explored. Comparisons with more realistic models suggest that the idealized model used in this study produces a reasonable representation of the effect of OHT on SSTs equatorward of subtropical continents, and hence can be used to study the role of OHT in shaping monsoon circulations on Earth.},

Heat stress results from a combination of elevated temperature and humidity, but the relative contributions of each of these to heat stress changes have yet to be quantified. Here, conditions for the baseline specific humidity are derived for when specific humidity or temperature dominates heat stress changes, as measured using the equivalent potential temperature (\texttheta E). Separate conditions are derived over ocean and over land, in addition to a condition for when relative humidity changes make a larger contribution than the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron response at fixed relative humidity. These conditions are used to interpret the \texttheta E responses in transient warming simulations with an ensemble of models participating in phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project. The regional pattern of \texttheta E changes is shown to be largely determined by the pattern of specific humidity changes, with the pattern of temperature changes playing a secondary role. This holds whether considering changes in seasonal-mean \texttheta E or in extreme (98th-percentile) \texttheta E events, and uncertainty in the response of specific humidity to warming is shown to be the leading source of uncertainty in the \texttheta E response at most land locations. Finally, analysis of ERA5 data demonstrates that the pattern of observed \texttheta E changes is also well explained by the pattern of specific humidity changes. These results demonstrate that understanding regional changes in specific humidity is largely sufficient for understanding regional changes in heat stress.},

  abstract = {Abstract A dry atmospheric general circulation model is forced with large-scale, Gaussian orography in an attempt to isolate a regime in which the model responds linearly to orographic forcing and then to study the departures from linearity as the orography is increased in amplitude. In contrast to previous results, which emphasized the meridional propagation of orographically forced stationary waves, using the standard Held\textendash Suarez (H\textendash S) control climate, it is found that the linear regime is characterized by a meridionally trapped, zonally propagating wave. Meridionally trapped waves of this kind have been seen in other contexts, where they have been termed ``circumglobal waves.'' As the height of the orography is increased, the circumglobal wave coexists with a meridionally propagating wave and for large-enough heights the meridionally propagating wave dominates the response. A barotropic model on a sphere reproduces this trapped wave in the linear regime and also reproduces the transition to meridional propagation with increasing amplitude. However, mean-flow modification by the stationary waves is very different in the two models, making it difficult to argue that the transitions have the same causes. When adding asymmetry across the equator to the H\textendash S control climate and placing the orography in the cooler hemisphere, it becomes harder to generate trapped waves in the GCM and the trapping becomes sensitive to the shape of the orography. The barotropic model overestimates the trapping in this case. These results suggest that an improved understanding of the role of circumglobal waves will be needed to understand the stationary wave field and its sensitivity to the changes in the zonal-mean climate.},

This ``linear'' regime breaks down for larger heating rates and it is found that this is because the stability of the tropical atmosphere increases. At the same time, the equatorial winds increasingly superrotate. This superrotation is driven by stationary eddy momentum fluxes by the waves excited by the heating and is damped by the vertical advection of low-momentum air by the mean flow and, at large heating rates, by the divergence of momentum by transient eddies. These dynamics are explored in additional experiments in which the equator-to-pole temperature gradient is varied. Very strong superrotation is produced when a large heating rate is applied to a setup with a relatively weak equator-to-pole temperature gradient, though there is no evidence that this is a case of ``runaway'' superrotation.},

This balance is tested in simulations with a stationary wave model and with a dry, idealized general circulation model (GCM), in which large-scale orography is placed at the latitude of maximum surface wind speed. For the smallest mountain considered (maximum height H = 0.5 m), the nonacceleration balance is nearly met, but the damping in the stationary wave model induces an offset between the stationary eddy momentum flux (EMF) convergence and the mountain torque, leading to residual mean flow changes. A stationary nonlinearity appears for larger mountains (H {$\geq$} 10 m), driven by preferential deflection of the flow around the poleward flank of the orography, and causes further breakdown of the nonacceleration balance. The nonlinearity grows as H is increased, and is stronger in the GCM than in the stationary wave model, likely due to interactions with transient eddies. The midlatitude jet shifts poleward for H {$\leq$} 2 km and equatorward for larger mountains, reflecting changes in the transient EMFs, which push the jet poleward for smaller mountains and equatorward for larger mountains. The stationary EMFs consistently force the jet poleward. These results add to our understanding of how orography affects the atmosphere's momentum budget, providing insight into how the nonacceleration theorem breaks down; the roles of stationary nonlinearities and transients; and how orography affects the strength and latitude of eddy-driven jets.},

Frequency-dependent regressions are performed between the outgoing top-of-atmosphere (TOA) energy fluxes and the global-mean surface temperature in the preindustrial control simulations of the CMIP5 archive. Two distinct regimes are found. At subdecadal frequencies the surface temperature and the outgoing shortwave flux are in quadrature, while the outgoing longwave flux is linearly related to temperature and acts as a negative feedback on temperature perturbations. On longer time scales the outgoing shortwave and longwave fluxes are both linearly related to temperature, with the longwave continuing to act as a negative feedback and the shortwave acting as a positive feedback on temperature variability. In addition to the different phase relationships, the two regimes can also be seen in estimates of the coherence and of the frequency-dependent regression coefficients. The frequency-dependent regression coefficients for the total cloudy-sky flux on time scales of 2.5 to 3 years are found to be strongly (r2 {$>$} 0.6) related to the models' equilibrium climate sensitivities (ECSs), suggesting a potential ``emergent constraint'' for Earth's ECS. However, O(100) years of data are required for this relationship to become robust.

We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations.},

  abstract = {Improved greenhouse gas (GHG) emission efficiency of production has been proposed as one of the biggest potential advantages of cultured meat over conventional livestock production systems. Comparisons with beef are typically highlighted, as it is a highly emissions intensive food product. In this study, we present a more rigorous comparison of the potential climate impacts of cultured meat and cattle production than has previously been made. Warming impacts are evaluated using a simple climate model that simulates the different behaviors of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), rather than relying on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) metrics. We compare the temperature impact of beef cattle and cultured meat production at all times to 1,000 years in the future, using four synthetic meat GHG footprints currently available in the literature and three different beef production systems studied in an earlier climate modeling paper. Cattle systems are associated with the production of all three GHGs above, including significant emissions of CH4, while cultured meat emissions are almost entirely CO2 from energy generation. Under continuous high global consumption, cultured meat results in less warming than cattle initially, but this gap narrows in the long term and in some cases cattle production causes far less warming, as CH4 emissions do not accumulate, unlike CO2. We then model a decline in meat consumption to more sustainable levels following high consumption, and show that although cattle systems generally result in greater peak warming than cultured meat, the warming effect declines and stabilizes under the new emission rates of cattle systems, while the CO2 based warming from cultured meat persists and accumulates even under reduced consumption, again overtaking cattle production in some scenarios. We conclude that cultured meat is not prima facie climatically superior to cattle; its relative impact instead depends on the availability of decarbonized energy generation and the specific production systems that are realized.},

  abstract = {The atmospheric lifetime and radiative impacts of different climate pollutants can both differ markedly, so metrics that equate emissions using a single scaling factor, such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100), can be misleading. An alternative approach is to report emissions as `warming-equivalents' that result in similar warming impacts without requiring a like-for-like weighting per emission. GWP*, an alternative application of GWPs where the CO2-equivalence of short-lived climate pollutant emissions is predominantly determined by changes in their emission rate, provides a straightforward means of generating warming-equivalent emissions. In this letter we illustrate the contrasting climate impacts resulting from emissions of methane, a short-lived greenhouse gas, and CO2, and compare GWP100 and GWP* CO2-equivalents for a number of simple emissions scenarios. We demonstrate that GWP* provides a useful indication of warming, while conventional application of GWP100 falls short in many scenarios and particularly when methane emissions are stable or declining, with important implications for how we consider `zero emission' or `climate neutral' targets for sectors emitting different compositions of gases. We then illustrate how GWP* can provide an improved means of assessing alternative mitigation strategies. GWP* allows warming-equivalent emissions to be calculated directly from CO2-equivalent emissions reported using GWP100, consistent with the Paris Rulebook agreed by the UNFCCC, on condition that short-lived and cumulative climate pollutants are aggregated separately, which is essential for transparency. It provides a direct link between emissions and anticipated warming impacts, supporting stocktakes of progress towards a long-term temperature goal and compatible with cumulative emissions budgets.},

By analyzing future climate projections from a large ensemble of the CMIP5 models under a high emission scenario (RCP8.5), we investigate how the atmospheric forcing and ocean circulation determine heat uptake and redistribution in the Southern Hemisphere oceans. About two-thirds of the net surface heat gain in the high-latitude Southern Ocean is redistributed northward, leading to enhanced and deep-reaching warming at middle latitudes near the boundary between the subtropical gyres and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The projected magnitudes of the ocean warming are closely related to the magnitudes of the wind and gyre boundary poleward shifts across the models. For those models with the simulated gyre boundary biased equatorward, the latitude where the projected ocean warming peaks is also located farther equatorward and a larger poleward shift of the gyre boundary is projected. In a theoretical framework, the subsurface ocean changes are explored using three distinctive processes on the temperature\textendash salinity diagram: pure heave, pure warming, and pure freshening. The enhanced middle-latitude warming and the deepening of isopycnals are attributed to the pure heave and pure warming processes, likely related to the wind-driven heat convergence and the accumulation of extra surface heat uptake by the background ocean circulation, respectively. The equatorward and downward subductions of the surface heat and freshwater input at high latitudes (i.e., pure warming and pure freshening processes) result in cooling and freshening spiciness changes on density surfaces within the Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water.},

In this paper, analytical reasoning is used to investigate why TCRE is near constant over a range of cumulative emissions up to 2000 Pg of carbon. In addition, a climate model of intermediate complexity, forced with a constant flux of CO2 emissions, is used to explore the effect of terrestrial carbon cycle feedback strength on TCRE. The analysis reveals that TCRE emerges from the diminishing radiative forcing from CO2 per unit mass being compensated for by the diminishing ability of the ocean to take up heat and carbon. The relationship is maintained as long as the ocean uptake of carbon, which is simulated to be a function of the CO2 emissions rate, dominates changes in the airborne fraction of carbon. Strong terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks have a dependence on the rate of carbon emission and, when present, lead to TRCE becoming rate dependent. Despite these feedbacks, TCRE remains roughly constant over the range of the representative concentration pathways and therefore maintains its primary utility as a metric of climate change.},

This can lead to significant insights regarding past, present, and future climate. For example, glacier modeling has demonstrated that the near-ubiquitous global pattern of glacier retreat during the last few centuries resulted from a global-scale climate warming of {$\sim$}1\textdegree C, consistent with instrumental data and climate proxy records. Climate reconstructions from glaciers have also demonstrated that the tropics were colder at the Last Glacial Maximum than was originally inferred from sea surface temperature reconstructions.

Heavy convective precipitation episodes that occurred in the West were considered as a separate category event. Climatological characteristics, composite analyses, and upper-air data are presented for these four classifications of events. The large variability of associated meteorological patterns and parameters (especially winds aloft) makes identification of necessary conditions for flash flood-producing rainfall quite difficult; however, a number of features were common to many of the events. An advancing middle-level, short-wave trough often helped to trigger and focus thunderstorm activity. The storm areas were often located very near the mid-tropospheric, large-scale ridge position and occurred within normally benign surface pressure patterns. Many of the intense rainfalls occurred during nighttime hours. These elusive characteristics further complicate a difficult forecast problem.},

In a series of integrations with altered topography and reduced surface heat fluxes, monsoon strength, as indicated by a vertical wind shear index, is highly correlated with the amplitude of the maximum boundary layer equivalent potential temperature (\texttheta eb) over South Asia. Removal of the Tibetan Plateau while preserving the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges has little effect on monsoon strength, and monsoon strength decreases approximately linearly as the height of the Himalayas is reduced. In terms of surface heat flux changes, monsoon strength is most sensitive to those in the location of the \texttheta eb maximum just south of the Himalayas. These results are consistent with the recent idea that topography creates a strong monsoon by insulating the thermal maximum from dry extratropical air. However, monsoon strength is found to be more sensitive to variations in the \texttheta eb maximum when topography is altered than when surface heat fluxes are reduced, and it is suggested that free-tropospheric humidity changes lead to deviations from strict convective quasi equilibrium and cause this difference. When topography is reduced, dry extratropical air intrudes into the troposphere over the \texttheta eb maximum and is entrained by local deep convection, requiring a higher \texttheta eb to achieve convective equilibrium with a given upper-tropospheric temperature and associated balanced monsoon flow. These results illustrate potential complexities that need to be included in simple theories for monsoon strength built on strict convective quasi equilibrium.},

To quantify the magnitude of these impacts, climate models need consistent land-cover change time series at a global scale, based on land-use information from observations or dedicated land-use change models. However, a specific land-use change cannot be unambiguously mapped to a specific land-cover change. Here, nine translation rules are evaluated based on assumptions about the way land-use change could potentially impact land cover. Utilizing the Global Land-use Model 2 (GLM2), the model underlying the latest Land-Use Harmonization dataset (LUH2), the land-cover dynamics resulting from land-use change were simulated based on multiple alternative translation rules from 850 to 2015 globally. For each rule, the resulting forest cover, carbon density and carbon emissions were compared with independent estimates from remote sensing observations, U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization reports, and other studies. The translation rule previously suggested by the authors of the HYDE 3.2 dataset, that underlies LUH2, is consistent with the results of our examinations at global, country and grid scales. This rule recommends that for CMIP6 simulations, models should (1) completely clear vegetation in land-use changes from primary and secondary land (including both forested and non-forested) to cropland, urban land and managed pasture; (2) completely clear vegetation in land-use changes from primary forest and/or secondary forest to rangeland; (3) keep vegetation in land-use changes from primary non-forest and/or secondary non-forest to rangeland. Our analysis shows that this rule is one of three (out of nine) rules that produce comparable estimates of forest cover, vegetation carbon and emissions to independent estimates and also mitigate the anomalously high carbon emissions from land-use change observed in previous studies in the 1950s. According to the three translation rules, contemporary global forest area is estimated to be 37.42\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{6}\&thinsp;km\textsuperscript{2}, within the range derived from remote sensing products. Likewise, the estimated carbon stock is in close agreement with reference biomass datasets, particularly over regions with more than 50\&thinsp;\% forest cover.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Systematic effects on lapse rate and humidity are likewise modest compared with the intermodel spread. Without parameterized convection Kelvin waves are more realistic.

This model contains the following simplications: a limited computational domain, an idealized topography, no beat transport by ocean currents, and fixed cloudiness. Despite these limitations, the results from this computation yield some indication of how the increase of CO\textsubscript{2} concentration may affect the distribution of temperature in the atmosphere. It is shown that the CO\textsubscript{2} increase raises the temperature of the model troposphere, whereas it lowers that of the model stratosphere. The tropospheric warming is somewhat larger than that expected from a radiative-convective equilibrium model. In particular, the increase of surface temperature in higher latitudes is magnified due to the recession of the snow boundary and the thermal stability of the lower troposphere which limits convective beating to the lowest layer. It is also shown that the doubling of carbon dioxide significantly increases the intensity of the hydrologic cycle of the model.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract The effect of the hydrology of the earth's surface is incorporated into a numerical model of the general circulation of the atmosphere developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA). The primitive equation of motion is used for this study. The nine levels of the model are distributed so as to resolve the surface boundary layer and stratosphere. The depletion of solar radiation and the transfer of the terrestrial radiation are computed taking into consideration cloud and atmospheric absorbers such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone. The scheme treating the hydrology of our model involves the prediction of water vapor in the atmosphere and the prediction of soil moisture and snow cover. In order to represent the mositure-holding capacity of soil, the continent is assumed to be covered by boxes, which can store limited amounts of water. The ocean surface is idealized to be a completely wet surface without any heat capacity. The temperature of the earth's surface is determined in such a way that it satisfies the condition of heat balance. To facilitate the analysis and the interpretation of the results, a simple and idealized distribution of the ocean and the continental region is chosen for this study. The numerical integrations are performed for the annual mean distribution of solar insolation. In general, the qualitative features of hydrologic and thermodynamic regimes at the earth's surface are successfully simulated. Particularly, the horizontal distribution of rainfall is in excellent qualitative agreement with the observations. For example, the typical subtropical desert, the break of the subtropical dry belt along the east coast of the continent, and the equatorial rain belt emerged as the result of numerical time integration. Some features of the spatial distributions of heat and water balance components at the earth's surface also agree well with those obtained by Budyko for the actual atmosphere. Owing to the lack of seasonal variation of solar insolation and lack of poleward transport of heat by ocean currents in the model, excessive snow cover develops at higher latitudes. Accordingly, the temperature in the polar region is much lower than the annual mean temperature observed in the actual atmosphere. This investigation constitutes a preliminary study preceding the numerical integration of the general circulation model of joint ocean-atmosphere interaction, in which the transport of heat by ocean currents plays an important role.},

  abstract = {Abstract In order to identify the effects of mountains upon the general circulation of the atmosphere, a set of numerical experiments is performed by use of a general circulation model developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of NOAA. The numerical time integrations of the model are performed with and without the effects of mountains. By comparing the structure of the model atmospheres that emerged from these two numerical experiments, it is possible to discuss the role of mountains in maintaining the stationary and transient disturbances in the atmosphere. The model adopted for this study has a global computational domain and covers both the troposphere and stratosphere. For the computation of radiative transfer, the distribution of incoming solar radiation in January is assumed. Over the ocean, the observed distribution of the sea surface temperature of February is assumed as a lower boundary condition of the model. Over the continental surface, temperature is determined such that the condition of heat balance at the ground surface is satisfied. The mountain topography is taken into consideration using the so-called {$\sigma$}-coordinate system in which pressure normalized by surface pressure is used as a vertical coordinate. The grid size for the computation of horizontal finite differences is chosen to be about 250 km. Nine finite-difference levels are chosen in unequal pressure intervals so that these levels can represent not only the structure of the mid-troposphere but also that of the stratosphere and the planetary boundary layer. The results of the numerical experiments indicate that it is necessary to consider the effects of mountains for the successful simulation of the stationary flow field in the atmosphere, particularly in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. As predicted by Bolin, the flow field in the upper troposphere of the mountain model has a stationary trough in the lees of major mountain ranges such as the Rocky Mountains and the Tibetan Plateau. To the east of the trough, an intense westerly flow predominates. In the stratosphere, an anticyclone develops over the Aleutian Archipelago. These features of the mountain model, which are missing in the model without mountains, are in good qualitative agreement with the features of the actual atmosphere in winter. In the model troposphere, mountains increase markedly the kinetic energy of stationary disturbances by increasing the stationary component of the eddy conversion of potential energy, whereas mountains decrease the kinetic energy of transient disturbances. The sum of the stationary and transient eddy kinetic energy is affected little by mountains. In the model stratosphere, mountains increase the amplitude of stationary disturbances partly because they enhance the energy supply from the model troposphere to the stratosphere. According to wavenumber analysis, the longitudinal scale of eddy conversion in the model atmosphere increases significantly due to the effects of mountains. This increase results mainly from the large increase of stationary eddy conversion which takes place at very low wavenumbers. The results of the analysis reveal other important effects of mountains. For example, the probability of cyclogenesis in the model atmosphere increases significantly on the lee side of major mountain ranges where the core of the westerly jet is located. Also, mountains affect the hydrologic processes in the model atmosphere by modifying the field of three-dimensional advection of moisture, and alter the global distribution of precipitation very significantly. In general, the distribution of the model with mountains is less zonal and more realistic than that of the model without mountains.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the response of a global model of the climate to the quadrupling of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. The model consists of (1) a general circulation model of the atmosphere, (2) a heat and water balance model of the continents, and (3) a simple mixed layer model of the oceans. It has a global computational domain and realistic geography. For the computation of radiative transfer, the seasonal variation of insolation is imposed at the top of the model atmosphere, and the fixed distribution of cloud cover is prescribed as a function of latitude and of height. It is found that with some exceptions, the model succeeds in reproducing the large-scale characteristics of seasonal and geographical variation of the observed atmospheric temperature. The climatic effect of a CO2 increase is determined by comparing statistical equilibrium states of the model atmosphere with a normal concentration and with a 4 times the normal concentration of CO2 in the air. It is found that the warming of the model atmosphere resulting from the CO2 increase has significant seasonal and latitudinal variation. Because of the absence of an albedo feedback mechanism, the warming over the Antarctic continent is somewhat less than the warming in high latitudes of the northern hemisphere. Over the Arctic Ocean and its surroundings, the warming is much larger in winter than summer, thereby reducing the amplitude of seasonal temperature variation. It is concluded that this seasonal asymmetry in the warming results from the reduction in the coverage and thickness of the sea ice. The warming of the model atmosphere results in an enrichment of the moisture content in the air and an increase in the poleward moisture transport. The additional moisture is picked up from the tropical ocean and is brought to high latitudes where both precipitation and runoff increase throughout the year. Further, the time of rapid snowmelt and maximum runoff becomes earlier.},

  abstract = {Abstract A numerical experiment with a general circulation model with a simple hydrologic cycle is performed. The basic framework of this model is identical with that adopted for the previous study [35] except for the incorporation of a simplified hydrologic cycle which consists of the advection of water vapor by large-scale motion, evaporation from the surface, precipitation and an artificial adjustment to simulate the process of moist convection. This adjustment is performed only when the relative humidity reaches 100 percent and the lapse rate exceeds the moist adiabatic lapse rate. The radiative flux is computed for the climatological distribution of water vapor instead of using the distribution calculated by the prognostic equation of water vapor. A completely wet surface without any heat capacity is chosen as the lower boundary. The initial conditions consist of a completely dry and isothermal atmosphere. A state of quasi-equilibrium is obtained as a result of the time integration of 187 days. A preliminary analysis of the result is performed for the 40-day period from 148th day to 187th day. According to this analysis, the hemispheric mean of the rate of precipitation is about 1.06 m./yr. which is close to the estimate of the annual mean rainfall obtained by Budyko [5]. In the Tropics rainfall exceeds evaporation and in the subtropics the latter exceeds the former in qualitative agreement with observation. The difference between them, however, is too exaggerated, and an extremely large export of water vapor from the dry subtropics into the wet, Tropics by the meridional circulation takes place. In the troposphere, relative humidity increases with decreasing altitude. In the stratosphere it is very low except at the tropical tropopause, and the mixing ratio of water vapor is extremely small in qualitative agreement with observation. Although water vapor is transported from the troposphere into the stratosphere, it is then transported toward low latitudes and condenses at the tropical tropopause where the temperature is very low and the relative humidity is high. Based upon a harmonic analysis of the flow field and the surface pressure field, it, is concluded that the effect of condensation tends to increase the wave number of the tropospheric flow and surface pressure field. Also, the incorporation of the moist process in the model seems to increase the intensity of meridional circulation in the Tropics. As a result of this increase, the transport of momentum and heat by the meridional circulation in the Tropics is much larger than that obtained from the previous study. In middle latitudes, the poleward transport of total energy in the moist-model atmosphere is less than that in the dry-model atmosphere because of the effect of the poleward transport of Intent energy or the heat of condensation. The latitudinal distributions of radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere and at the earth's surface coincide very well with those obtained by London [17] for the actual atmosphere. Bowen's ratio increases with increasing latitude and its magnitude coincides reasonably well with that obtained by Budyko [5] or Jacobs [11] for the ocean surface.},

The flow field in the model Tropics also displays interesting features. For example, a zone of strong convergence and a belt of heavy rain develops around the equator. Synoptic-scale disturbances such as weak tropical cyclones and shear lines with strong convergence develop and are reminiscent of disturbances in the actual tropical atmosphere. The humid towers, which result from moist convective adjustment and condensation, develop in the central core of the regions of strong upward motion, sometimes reaching the level of the tropical tropopause and thus heating the upper tropical troposphere. This heating compensates for the cooling due to radiation and the meridional circulation. According to the analysis of the energy budget of the model Tropics, the release of eddy available potential energy, which is mainly generated by the heat of condensation, constitutes the major source of eddy kinetic energy of disturbances prevailing in the model Tropics.},

  abstract = {Abstract The results of a numerical time integration of a hemispheric general circulation model of the atmosphere with moist processes and a uniform earth's surface has already been published by Manabe, Smagorinsky, and Strickler. In this study, the integration is repeated after halving the midlatitude grid size from approximately 500 to 250 km. This increase in the resolution of the horizontal finite differences markedly improves the features of the model atmosphere. For example, the system of fronts and the associated cyclone families in the high resolution atmosphere is much more realistic than that in the low resolution atmosphere. Furthermore, the general magnitude and the spectral distribution of eddy kinetic energy are in better agreement with the actual atmosphere as a result of the improvement in resolution. In order to explain these improvements, an extensive analysis of the energetics of both the low and high resolution atmospheric models is carried out. It is shown that these improvements are due not only to the increase of the accuracy of the finite differences but also to the shift in the scale of dissipation by the nonlinear lateral viscosity toward a smaller scale resulting from the decrease in grid size. In the low resolution atmospheric model, the transfer of energy from eddy to zonal kinetic energy is missing because of excessive subgrid scale dissipation at medium wave numbers, whereas it has significant magnitude in the high resolution atmospheric model. It is speculated that further increase of resolution should improve the results because it tends to separate the characteristic scale of dissipation from that of the source of eddy kinetic energy. The analysis of the energetics in wave number space clearly demonstrates the differences between the energetics of the different parts of the atmosphere. In middle latitudes there are essential differences between the energetics of the model troposphere and that of the model stratosphere. In the model troposphere, the eddy kinetic energy is produced by the conversion of eddy potential energy in the range of wave numbers from 2 to 8. Part of the energy thus produced is dissipated by the subgrid scale dissipation, and most of the remainder is decascaded to zonal kinetic energy. In the model stratosphere, where very long waves predominate, the eddy kinetic energy is generated in the range of wave numbers from 2 to 3 by the energy supplied from the troposphere. Most of this energy is then decascaded barotropically to zonal kinetic energy. In the Tropics, eddy kinetic energy is mainly produced by the release of eddy available potential energy generated by the heat of condensation. Although the rate of conversion is maximum at very low wave numbers, the conversion spectrum extends to very high wave numbers. A box diagram of the energetics of the high resolution moist model shows that the eddy available potential energy is generated by the heat of condensation as well as by energy transfer from the zonal available potential energy. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the zonal kinetic energy is maintained not only by the barotropic exchange from the eddy kinetic energy but also from the conversions of zonal potential energy. The intensification of the direct tropical cell and the weakening of the indirect Ferrel cell in middle latitudes caused by the moist processes are responsible for this positive zonal conversion. One of the highlights of the results from the integration of the high resolution moist model is the successful simulation of the evolution of fronts and the associated cyclone families. The influence of moist processes upon frontal structure as well as other synoptic features is investigated by comparing the moist model atmosphere with the dry model atmosphere without the effect of the selective heating of condensation. It is found that the heat of condensation significantly reduces the width of fronts and the characteristic scale of cyclones in the lower troposphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study investigates the response of a climate model to a gradual increase or decrease of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The model is a general circulation model of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-land surface system with global geography and seasonal variation of insulation. To offset the bias of the coupled model toward settling into an unrealistic state, the fluxes of heat and water at the ocean-atmosphere interface are adjusted by amounts that vary with season and geography but do not change from one year to the next. Starting from a quasi-equilibrium climate, three numerical time integrations of the coupled model are performed with gradually increasing, constant, and gradually decreasing concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. It is noted that the simulated response of sea surface temperature is very slow over the northern North Atlantic and the Circumpolar Ocean of the Southern Hemisphere where vertical mixing of water penetrates very deeply. However, in most of the Northern Hemisphere and low latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere, the distribution of the change in surface air temperature of the model at the time of doubling (or halving) of atmospheric carbon dioxide resembles the equilibrium response of an atmospheric-mixed layer ocean model to CO2 doubling (or halving). For example, the rise of annual mean surface air temperature in response to the gradual increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide increases with latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere and is larger over continents than oceans. When the time-dependent response of the model oceans to the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide is compared with the corresponding response to the CO2, reduction at an identical rate, the penetration of the cold anomaly in the latter case is significantly deeper than that of the warm anomaly in the former case. The lack of symmetry in the penetration depth of a thermal anomaly between the two cases is associated with the difference in static stability, which is due mainly to the change in the vertical distribution of salinity in high latitudes and temperature changes in middle and low latitudes. Despite the difference in penetration depth and accordingly, the effective thermal inertia of the oceans between the two experiments, the time-dependent response of the global mean surface air temperature in the CO2 reduction experiment is similar in magnitude to the corresponding response in the CO2 growth experiment. In the former experiment with a colder climate, snow and sea ice with high surface albedo cover a much larger area, thereby enhancing their positive feedback effect upon surface air temperature. On the other hand, surface cooling is reduced due to the larger effective thermal inertia of the oceans. Because of the compensation between these two effects, the magnitude of surface air temperature response turned out to be similar between the two experiments.},

Near the earth's surface, the general features of the time mean flow field and the location of the inter-tropical convergence zone of the model compare favorably with those of the actual atmosphere. Along the convergence zone or shear line, disturbances with a characteristic scale of 2000\textendash 3000 km develop and cause heavy precipitation. They tend to develop in the geographical areas where the formation of actual tropical storms is most probable. In the upper troposphere of the model tropics, disturbances with planetary scale develop and are responsible for the maximum of eddy kinetic energy there. In general, both the kinetic energy of the tropical cyclones and that of the planetary-scale disturbances in the model tropics are chiefly maintained by the conversion of available potential energy generated by the heat of condensation. However, the planetary-scale disturbances in the upper troposphere of the tropics seem to be also affected by various factors such as the interaction with higher latitudes and land\textendash sea contrast. It is noteworthy that these disturbances transport angular momentum across the equator in the upper troposphere and strongly affect the budget of angular momentum in the model tropics.},

The first model, the gray-radiation moist (GRaM) AGCM, has simplified physics, while the second model, the GFDL Atmospheric Model version 2.1 (AM2.1), is a fully comprehensive AGCM. Both models have a continent that is 60\textdegree{} wide in longitude from 10\textdegree{} to 30\textdegree N, in an otherwise slab-ocean-covered world. The precipitation response varies with cloudy- and clear-sky feedbacks and depends on continental albedo. In GRaM simulations with a continent, precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere decreases mostly as a result of decreased evaporation. In AM2.1 simulations, precipitation also shifts southward via Hadley circulation changes due to increasing albedo, but the radiative impact of clouds and moisture creates a more complex response. Results are similar when a seasonal cycle of insolation is included in AM2.1 simulations. The impact of a large, bright subtropical continent is to shift precipitation to the opposite hemisphere. In these simulations, the hemisphere of greater tropical precipitation is better predicted by the hemisphere with greater atmospheric energy input, as has been shown in previous literature, rather than the hemisphere that has higher surface temperature.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the Arctic has been warming and sea ice disappearing. By contrast, the Southern Ocean around Antarctica has been (mainly) cooling and sea-ice extent growing. We argue here that interhemispheric asymmetries in the mean ocean circulation, with sinking in the northern North Atlantic and upwelling around Antarctica, strongly influence the sea-surface temperature (SST) response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing, accelerating warming in the Arctic while delaying it in the Antarctic. Furthermore, while the amplitude of GHG forcing has been similar at the poles, significant ozone depletion only occurs over Antarctica. We suggest that the initial response of SST around Antarctica to ozone depletion is one of cooling and only later adds to the GHG-induced warming trend as upwelling of sub-surface warm water associated with stronger surface westerlies impacts surface properties. We organize our discussion around `climate response functions' (CRFs), i.e. the response of the climate to `step' changes in anthropogenic forcing in which GHG and/or ozone-hole forcing is abruptly turned on and the transient response of the climate revealed and studied. Convolutions of known or postulated GHG and ozone-hole forcing functions with their respective CRFs then yield the transient forced SST response (implied by linear response theory), providing a context for discussion of the differing warming/cooling trends in the Arctic and Antarctic. We speculate that the period through which we are now passing may be one in which the delayed warming of SST associated with GHG forcing around Antarctica is largely cancelled by the cooling effects associated with the ozone hole. By mid-century, however, ozone-hole effects may instead be adding to GHG warming around Antarctica but with diminished amplitude as the ozone hole heals. The Arctic, meanwhile, responding to GHG forcing but in a manner amplified by ocean heat transport, may continue to warm at an accelerating rate.},

A novel framework is set out which involves integration of an ocean-only model in which the anthropogenic temperature signal is forced from the surface by anomalous downwelling heat fluxes and damped at a rate controlled by a `climate feedback' parameter. We observe a broad correspondence between the evolution of the anthropogenic temperature (\$\$T\_\{anthro\}\$\$) in our simplified ocean-only model and that of coupled climate models perturbed by a quadrupling of \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CO\}\_\{2\}\$\$. This suggests that many of the mechanisms at work in fully coupled models are captured by our idealized ocean-only system. The framework allows us to probe the role of the ocean in delaying warming signals in the Southern Ocean and in the northern North Atlantic, and in amplifying the warming signal in the Arctic. By comparing active and passive temperature-like tracers we assess the degree to which changes in ocean circulation play a role in setting the distribution and evolution of \$\$T\_\{anthro\}\$\$. The background ocean circulation strongly influences the large-scale patterns of ocean heat uptake and storage, such that \$\$T\_\{anthro\}\$\$is governed by an advection/diffusion equation and weakly damped to the atmosphere at a rate set by climate feedbacks. Where warming is sufficiently small, for example in the Southern Ocean, changes in ocean circulation play a secondary role. In other regions, most noticeably in the North Atlantic, changes in ocean circulation induced by \$\$T\_\{anthro\}\$\$are central in shaping the response.},

  abstract = {Through study of observations and coupled climate simulations, it is argued that the mean position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) north of the equator is a consequence of a northwards heat transport across the equator by ocean circulation. Observations suggest that the hemispheric net radiative forcing of climate at the top of the atmosphere is almost perfectly symmetric about the equator, and so the total (atmosphere plus ocean) heat transport across the equator is small (order 0.2~PW northwards). Due to the Atlantic ocean's meridional overturning circulation, however, the ocean carries significantly more heat northwards across the equator (order 0.4~PW) than does the coupled system. There are two primary consequences. First, atmospheric heat transport is southwards across the equator to compensate (0.2~PW southwards), resulting in the ITCZ being displaced north of the equator. Second, the atmosphere, and indeed the ocean, is slightly warmer (by perhaps 2 \textdegree C) in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. This leads to the northern hemisphere emitting slightly more outgoing longwave radiation than the southern hemisphere by virtue of its relative warmth, supporting the small northward heat transport by the coupled system across the equator. To conclude, the coupled nature of the problem is illustrated through study of atmosphere\textendash ocean\textendash ice simulations in the idealized setting of an aquaplanet, resolving the key processes at work.},

This atmospheric model, known as the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), includes fully interactive chemistry, allowing, for example, a self-consistent representation of the development and recovery of the stratospheric ozone hole and its effect on the troposphere. This paper focuses on analysis of an ensemble of transient simulations using CESM1(WACCM), covering the period from the preindustrial era to present day, conducted as part of phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. Variability in the stratosphere, such as that associated with stratospheric sudden warmings and the development of the ozone hole, is in good agreement with observations. The signals of these phenomena propagate into the troposphere, influencing near-surface winds, precipitation rates, and the extent of sea ice. In comparison of tropospheric climate change predictions with those from a version of CESM that does not fully resolve the stratosphere, the global-mean temperature trends are indistinguishable. However, systematic differences do exist in other climate variables, particularly in the extratropics. The magnitude of the difference can be as large as the climate change response itself. This indicates that the representation of stratosphere\textendash troposphere coupling could be a major source of uncertainty in climate change projections in CESM.},

  abstract = {Quasi-horizontal wave motions in the equatorial area are discussed. A single layer of homogeneous incompressible fluid with free surface is treated. The Coriolis parameter is assumed to be proportional to the latitude. In general, waves of two different types are obtained as solutions, one being the inertio-gravity wave and the other Rossby wave. They are distinguished from each other by the difference of frequencies and by the relationships between pressure and velocity fields.For the solutions of the lowest mode (waves confined near the equator), however, the distinction between the Rossby and the inertio-gravity waves is not clear. The wave moves westward and the frequency of this wave is compared to that of the gravity wave, if wave length is large. With the increase of the wave number the frequency decreases and approaches to that of the Rossby type wave. The pressure and wind fields of this wave show somewhat mixed character of the two types, and change continuously with the wave number. In this connection it seems impossible to "filter out" gravity waves from large scale motions.Another interesting feature of the equatorial disturbances is that the low frequency waves are trapped near the equator. It is shown that the both waves of inertio-gravity type and of the Rossby type have appreciable amplitude only near the equator. The characteristic north-south extent of the waves is (c/{$\beta$})1/2, where c is the velocity of long gravity waves and {$\beta$} is the Rossby parameter. This expression is identical with that derived by Bretherton (1964) for inertio-gravity oscillations in a meridional plane.In the later half, "forced stationary motion" in the equatorial region is treated. Based on the same model, mass sources and sinks are introduced periodically in the east-west direction. Then the motions and surface topography caused by them are calculated.As expected, high and low pressures appear where mass source and sink are given respectively. But these high and low cells are splitted into two parts separated by troughs or ridges located along the equator. Strong east-west current was formed along the equator. The flow directs from source to sink and it is intensified by the turning of the circular flow in the higher latitudes.},

The solar forcing is provided for radiative properties, namely total solar irradiance (TSI), solar spectral irradiance (SSI), and the F10.7 index as well as particle forcing, including geomagnetic indices Ap and Kp, and ionization rates to account for effects of solar protons, electrons, and galactic cosmic rays. This is the first time that a recommendation for solar-driven particle forcing has been provided for a CMIP exercise. The solar forcing datasets are provided at daily and monthly resolution separately for the CMIP6 preindustrial control, historical (1850\textendash 2014), and future (2015\textendash 2300) simulations. For the preindustrial control simulation, both constant and time-varying solar forcing components are provided, with the latter including variability on 11-year and shorter timescales but no long-term changes. For the future, we provide a realistic scenario of what solar behavior could be, as well as an additional extreme Maunder-minimum-like sensitivity scenario. This paper describes the forcing datasets and also provides detailed recommendations as to their implementation in current climate models.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}For the historical simulations, the TSI and SSI time series are defined as the average of two solar irradiance models that are adapted to CMIP6 needs: an empirical one (NRLTSI2\textendash NRLSSI2) and a semi-empirical one (SATIRE). A new and lower TSI value is recommended: the contemporary solar-cycle average is now 1361.0 W m\textsuperscript{-2}. The slight negative trend in TSI over the three most recent solar cycles in the CMIP6 dataset leads to only a small global radiative forcing of -0.04 W m\textsuperscript{-2}. In the 200\textendash 400 nm wavelength range, which is important for ozone photochemistry, the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset shows a larger solar-cycle variability contribution to TSI than in CMIP5 (50 \% compared to 35 \%).{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}We compare the climatic effects of the CMIP6 solar forcing dataset to its CMIP5 predecessor by using time-slice experiments of two chemistry\textendash climate models and a reference radiative transfer model. The differences in the long-term mean SSI in the CMIP6 dataset, compared to CMIP5, impact on climatological stratospheric conditions (lower shortwave heating rates of -0.35 K day\textsuperscript{-1} at the stratopause), cooler stratospheric temperatures (-1.5 K in the upper stratosphere), lower ozone abundances in the lower stratosphere (-3 \%), and higher ozone abundances (+1.5 \% in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere). Between the maximum and minimum phases of the 11-year solar cycle, there is an increase in shortwave heating rates (+0.2 K day\textsuperscript{-1} at the stratopause), temperatures ( {$\sim$} 1 K at the stratopause), and ozone (+2.5 \% in the upper stratosphere) in the tropical upper stratosphere using the CMIP6 forcing dataset. This solar-cycle response is slightly larger, but not statistically significantly different from that for the CMIP5 forcing dataset.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}CMIP6 models with a well-resolved shortwave radiation scheme are encouraged to prescribe SSI changes and include solar-induced stratospheric ozone variations, in order to better represent solar climate variability compared to models that only prescribe TSI and/or exclude the solar-ozone response. We show that monthly-mean solar-induced ozone variations are implicitly included in the SPARC/CCMI CMIP6 Ozone Database for historical simulations, which is derived from transient chemistry\textendash climate model simulations and has been developed for climate models that do not calculate ozone interactively. CMIP6 models without chemistry that perform a preindustrial control simulation with time-varying solar forcing will need to use a modified version of the SPARC/CCMI Ozone Database that includes solar variability. CMIP6 models with interactive chemistry are also encouraged to use the particle forcing datasets, which will allow the potential long-term effects of particles to be addressed for the first time. The consideration of particle forcing has been shown to significantly improve the representation of reactive nitrogen and ozone variability in the polar middle atmosphere, eventually resulting in further improvements in the representation of solar climate variability in global models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, greenhouse gas concentration stabilization is an awkward framework within which to assess dangerous climate change on account of the significant lag between a given concentration level and the eventual equilibrium temperature change. By contrast, recent research has shown that global temperature change can be well described by a given cumulative carbon emissions budget. Here, we propose that cumulative carbon emissions represent an alternative framework that is applicable both as a tool for climate mitigation as well as for the assessment of potential climate impacts. We show first that both atmospheric CO2 concentration at a given year and the associated temperature change are generally associated with a unique cumulative carbon emissions budget that is largely independent of the emissions scenario. The rate of global temperature change can therefore be related to first order to the rate of increase of cumulative carbon emissions. However, transient warming over the next century will also be strongly affected by emissions of shorter lived forcing agents such as aerosols and methane. Non-CO2 emissions therefore contribute to uncertainty in the cumulative carbon budget associated with near-term temperature targets, and may suggest the need for a mitigation approach that considers separately short- and long-lived gas emissions. By contrast, long-term temperature change remains primarily associated with total cumulative carbon emissions owing to the much longer atmospheric residence time of CO2 relative to other major climate forcing agents.},

  abstract = {A subtropical Rossby-wave propagation mechanism is proposed to account for the poleward and eastward progression of intraseasonal convective anomalies along the South Pacific convergence zone (SPCZ) that is observed in a significant proportion of Madden\textendash Julian oscillations (MJOs). Large-scale convection, associated with an MJO, is assumed to be already established over the Indonesian region. The latent heating associated with this convection forces an equatorial Rossby-wave response with an upper-tropospheric anticyclone centred over, or slightly to the west of, the convection. Large potential-vorticity (PV) gradients, associated with the subtropical jet and the tropopause, lie just poleward of the anticyclone, and large magnitude PV air is advected equatorwards on the eastern side of the anticyclone. This `high' PV air, or upper-tropospheric trough, is far enough off the equator that it has associated strong horizontal temperature gradients, and it induces deep ascent on its eastern side, at a latitude of about 15\textendash 30\textdegree. If this deep ascent is over a region susceptible to deep convection, such as the SPCZ, then convection may be forced or triggered. Hence convection develops along the SPCZ as a forced response to convection over Indonesia. The response mechanism is essentially one of subtropical Rossby-wave propagation. This hypothesis is based on a case study of a particularly strong MJO in early 1988, and is tested by idealized modelling studies. The mechanism may also be relevant to the existence of the mean SPCZ, as a forced response to mean Indonesian convection.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic forcing is driving energy accumulation in the Earth system, including increases in the sensible heat content of the atmosphere, as measured by dry-bulb temperature\textemdash the metric that is almost universally used for communications about climate change. The atmosphere is also moistening, though, representing an accumulation of latent heat, which is partly concealed by dry-bulb temperature trends. We highlight that, consistent with basic theory, latent heat gains are outpacing sensible heat gains over about half of the Earth's surface. The difference is largest in the tropics, where global ``hotspots'' of total heat accumulation are located, and where regional disparities in heating rates are very poorly represented by dry-bulb temperatures. Including latent heat in climate-change metrics captures this heat accumulation and therefore improves adaptation-relevant understanding of the extreme humid heat and precipitation hazards that threaten these latitudes so acutely. For example, irrigation can lower peak dry-bulb temperatures, but amplify latent heat content by a larger margin, intensifying dangerous heat stress. Based on a review of the research literature, our Perspective therefore calls for routine use of equivalent temperature, a measure that expresses the combined sensible and latent heat content of the atmosphere in the familiar units of \textdegree C or K. We recognize that dry-bulb air temperature must remain a key indicator of the atmospheric state, not least for the many sectors that are sensitive to sensible heat transfer. However, we assert here that more widespread use of equivalent temperature could improve process understanding, public messaging, and adaptation to climate change.

  abstract = {Abstract A numerical experiment is described which explores the relationship between upper-level potential vorticity advection and cyclogenesis on the leeward side of mountain barriers. A multilevel primitive equation model framed in isentropic coordinates is used to simulate the growth of a wave disturbance on the cold front associated with a preexisting ``parent'' cyclone. The effect of a mountain barrier placed in the path of the advancing cold front and the effect of an enhanced upper-level jet streak on the growth rate of the disturbance are investigated. Enhancement of the jet streak is accomplished by altering the geostrophic potential vorticity in a region upstream of the mountain barrier and solving for the corresponding man and geostrophic velocity field. The experiment suggests a strong connection between the intensity of the jet weak impinging on the barrier and the pressure fall in the lee. We also find that the strongest leeside pressure fall in this experiment is not accompanied by a conversion of available potential energy to kinetic energy. This suggests that geostrophic adjustment processes, rather than baroclinic instability, may cause the rapid initial growth of some, though possibly not all, lee cyclones.},

  abstract = {A new release of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model version 1.2 (MPI-ESM1.2) is presented. The development focused on correcting errors in and improving the physical processes representation, as well as improving the computational performance, versatility, and overall user friendliness. In addition to new radiation and aerosol parameterizations of the atmosphere, several relatively large, but partly compensating, coding errors in the model's cloud, convection, and turbulence parameterizations were corrected. The representation of land processes was refined by introducing a multilayer soil hydrology scheme, extending the land biogeochemistry to include the nitrogen cycle, replacing the soil and litter decomposition model and improving the representation of wildfires. The ocean biogeochemistry now represents cyanobacteria prognostically in order to capture the response of nitrogen fixation to changing climate conditions and further includes improved detritus settling and numerous other refinements. As something new, in addition to limiting drift and minimizing certain biases, the instrumental record warming was explicitly taken into account during the tuning process. To this end, a very high climate sensitivity of around 7 K caused by low-level clouds in the tropics as found in an intermediate model version was addressed, as it was not deemed possible to match observed warming otherwise. As a result, the model has a climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 over preindustrial conditions of 2.77 K, maintaining the previously identified highly nonlinear global mean response to increasing CO2 forcing, which nonetheless can be represented by a simple two-layer model.},

Warming of the ocean above 700\,m over the past few decades has been well documented. However, most of the ocean lies below 700\,m. Here we analyse observations of heat uptake into the deep North Atlantic. We find that the extratropical North Atlantic as a whole warmed by 1.45{$\pm$}0.5\texttimes 1022\,J between 1955 and 2005, but Lower North Atlantic Deep Water cooled, most likely as an adjustment from an early twentieth-century warm period. In contrast, the heat content of Upper North Atlantic Deep Water exhibited strong decadal variability. We demonstrate and quantify the importance of density-compensated temperature anomalies for long-term heat uptake into the deep North Atlantic. These anomalies form in the subpolar gyre and propagate equatorwards. High salinity in the subpolar gyre is a key requirement for this mechanism. In the past 50 years, suitable conditions have occurred only twice: first during the 1960s and again during the past decade. We conclude that heat uptake through density-compensated temperature anomalies will contribute to deep ocean heat uptake in the near term. In the longer term, the importance of this mechanism will be determined by competition between the multiple processes that influence subpolar gyre salinity in a changing climate.},

SWV has also been projected to increase by up to a factor of 2 over the twenty-first century. Trends in SWV impact stratospheric temperatures, which may lead to changes in the stratospheric circulation. Perturbations in temperature and wind in the stratosphere have been shown to influence the extratropical tropospheric circulation. This study investigates the response to a uniform doubling in SWV from 3 to 6 ppmv in a comprehensive stratosphere-resolving atmospheric GCM. The increase in SWV causes stratospheric cooling with a maximum amplitude of 5\textendash 6 K in the polar lower stratosphere and 2\textendash 3 K in the tropical lower stratosphere. The zonal wind on the upper flanks of the subtropical jets is more westerly by up to \textasciitilde 5 m s-1. Changes in resolved wave drag in the stratosphere result in an increase in the strength of tropical upwelling associated with the Brewer\textendash Dobson circulation of \textasciitilde 10\% throughout the year. In the troposphere, the increase in SWV causes significant meridional dipole changes in the midlatitude zonal-mean zonal wind of up to 2.8 m s-1 at 850 hPa, which are largest in boreal winter in both hemispheres. This suggests a more poleward storm track under uniformly increased stratospheric water vapor. The circulation changes in both the stratosphere and troposphere are almost entirely due to the increase in SWV at pressures greater than 50 hPa. The results show that long-term trends in SWV may impact stratospheric temperatures and wind, the strength of the Brewer\textendash Dobson circulation, and extratropical surface climate.},

This is due to the reduction in ozone-induced cooling from the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of ozone recovery since the late 1990s. In summary, the results show much better consistency between simulated and satellite-observed stratospheric temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al.

This study examines the sensitivity of a detailed line-by-line (LBL) code, a Malkmus narrow-band model and two broadband GCM radiation codes to a uniform perturbation in SWV in the longwave spectral region. The choice of sampling rate in wave number space ({$\Delta\nu$}) in the LBL code is shown to be important for calculations of the instantaneous change in heating rate ({$\Delta$}Q) and the instantaneous longwave radiative forcing ({$\Delta$}Ftrop). {$\Delta$}Q varies by up to 50\% for values of {$\Delta\nu$} spanning 5 orders of magnitude, and {$\Delta$}Ftrop varies by up to 10\%. In the three less detailed codes, {$\Delta$}Qdiffers by up to 45\% at 100 hPa and 50\% at 1 hPa compared to a LBL calculation. This causes differences of up to 70\% in the equilibrium fixed dynamical heating temperature change due to the SWV perturbation. The stratosphere-adjusted radiative forcing differs by up to 96\% across the less detailed codes.

Most of this extra heat warmed the ocean, and a comparatively small fraction went into sea ice melt. Poleward energy transports and radiation contributed to this energy increase at varying strengths. On a seasonal scale, stronger radiative energy input during summer associated with the ice-albedo feedback enhances seasonal oceanic heat uptake and sea ice melt. In return, lower sea ice extent and higher sea surface temperatures lead to enhanced heat release from the ocean during fall. This weakens meridional temperature gradients, consequently reducing atmospheric energy transports into the polar cap. The seasonal cycle of the Arctic energy budget is thus amplified, whereas the Arctic's long-term energy imbalance is close to the global mean.},

Observational products provide independent estimates of crucial budget terms, including oceanic heat transport from unique mooring-derived data, radiative fluxes from satellites, and sea ice volume from merged satellite data. Results show that the time averages of independent estimates of radiative, atmospheric, and oceanic energy fluxes into the Arctic Ocean domain are remarkably consistent in the sense that their sum closely matches the observed rate of regional long-term oceanic heat accumulation of \textasciitilde 1 W m\textsuperscript{-2}. Atmospheric and oceanic heat transports are found to be stronger compared to earlier assessments (\textasciitilde 100 and \textasciitilde 16 W m\textsuperscript{-2}, respectively). Data inconsistencies are larger when considering the mean annual cycle of the coupled energy budget, with RMS values of the monthly budget residual between 7 and 15 W m\textsuperscript{-2}, depending on the employed datasets. This nevertheless represents an average reduction of \textasciitilde 72\% of the residual compared to earlier work and demonstrates the progress made in data quality and diagnostic techniques. Finally, the budget residual is eliminated using a variational approach to provide a best estimate of the mean annual cycle. The largest remaining sources of uncertainty are ocean heat content and latent heat associated with sea ice melt and freeze, which both suffer from the lack of observational constraints.

A new estimate for the net poleward total energy transport is given. Comparison to satellite-derived radiation data proves that ERA-Interim is better suited for investigation of interannual variations of the global energy budget than available satellite data since these either cover a relatively short period of time or are too inhomogeneous in time. While much improved compared to the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), regionally averaged energy budgets of ERA-Interim show that strong anomalies of forecasted vertical fluxes tend to be partly compensated by unrealistically large forecasted energy storage rates. Discrepancies between observed and forecasted monthly mean tendencies can be taken as rough measure for the uncertainties involved in the ERA-Interim energy budget. El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is shown to have large impact on regional energy budgets, but strong compensation occurs between the western and eastern Pacific, leading to only small net variations of the total poleward energy transports (similar magnitude as the uncertainty of the computations). However, Hovm\"oller longitude\textendash time plots of tropical energy exports show relatively strong slowly eastward-moving poleward transport anomalies in connection with ENSO. Verification of these findings using independent estimates still needs to be done.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The arctic ice pack is a mixture of ice of many different thicknesses. Ice growth and heat exchange are strongly influenced by thickness, particularly when the ice is thin. For this reason measurements at a particular location do not necessarily represent conditions elsewhere within the region. Large-scale heat exchange estimates must take into account contributions made by different thicknesses of ice. This requires information on the relative area covered by ice of any given thickness and on how each flux varies with thickness. Strain histories derived from the motions of several buoy and drifting station arrays were combined with climatological data on air temperatures and incoming radiation to estimate time dependent changes in the distribution of ice thickness in the Central Arctic. Thermodynamic ice models were used to determine the dependence of heat exchange and ice production on ice thickness. Large-scale fluxes were then obtained by summing the area weighted contributions made by each ice thickness category. Differences between the large-scale fluxes and those based on local measurements over perennial ice were due almost entirely to the effects of young ice less than a meter in thickness. Net annual ice production in areas of thin ice totaled about 1 m when averaged over the entire area of the strain array. In contrast to the very small annual values measured over multiyear ice, large-scale turbulent heat losses were close to 200 MJ m-2 year-1, similar in magnitude to the net radiation. Absorption of shortwave radiation by summer leads resulted in annual net radiation totals for the region which were more than double those over the ice. Solar energy absorbed in the water played a major role in the mass balance of the ice cover. Intermediate thicknesses (0.2\textendash 0.8 m) of young ice, rather than open leads, exerted the greatest influence on ice production, heat input to the atmosphere, and salt input to the ocean. Monthly and annual heat flux totals obtained with different strain histories showed little correlation with the average divergence, suggesting that the variability of the strain field may be more important than the long-term average of the strain components.},

Surface-energy balances determine rates of ablation and accretion; diffusion equations govern heat transport within the ice and snow. The incoming radiative and turbulent fluxes, oceanic heat flux, ice salinity, snow accumulation, and surface albedo are specified as functions of time. Starting from an arbitrary initial condition, the model is integrated numerically until annual equilibrium patterns of temperature and thickness are achieved. The model is applied to the central Arctic. Input values for the initial test of the model are based on observational data. Values predicted by the model for the average ice thickness (288 cm), amount of surface ablation (40 cm), and the temperature field all agree closely with field observations. Other results from the model indicate that, under present conditions, the ocean must supply 1 to 2 kcal/cm2 year to the ice; an additional 4 kcal/cm2 year would cause the ice to vanish. Annual snow depths less than 70 cm are shown to have little effect on equilibrium thickness; snow depths greater than 70 cm would result in much thicker ice. Comparison of observed and calculated temperature profiles suggest that about 2.0 to 2.5 kcal/cm2 year of the incoming short-wave radiation penetrates the ice and contributes to internal heating. Average ice albedos under 0.50 would cause the ice to vanish in a few years.},

This paper develops an energy balance model that shows how shifts of the Hadley cell terminus and changes of the meridional energy flux out of the Hadley cell can drive shifts of storm tracks, identified as extrema of the atmospheric meridional eddy energy flux. The distance between the Hadley cell terminus and the storm tracks is primarily controlled by the energy flux out of the Hadley cell. Because tropical forcings alone can modify the Hadley cell terminus, they can also shift extratropical storm tracks, as demonstrated through simulations with an idealized GCM. Additionally, a strengthening of the meridional temperature gradient at the terminus and hence of the energy flux out of the Hadley cell can reduce the distance between the Hadley cell terminus and the storm tracks, enabling storm-track shifts that do not parallel shifts of the Hadley cell terminus. Thus, with the aid of the energy balance model and supporting GCM simulations, a closed theory of storm-track shifts emerges.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Climate models, supported by a growing body of observational data, have demonstrated that storm tracks shift poleward as the climate warms. But the dynamical mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unclear. To isolate what portion of the storm track shift may be accounted for by large-scale dry dynamics alone, disregarding the latent heat released in phase changes of water, this study investigates the storm track shift under various kinds of climate change in an idealized dry general circulation model (GCM) with an adjustable but constant convective stability. It is found that increasing the mean surface temperature or the convective stability leads to poleward shifts of storm tracks, even if the convective stability is increased only in a narrow band around the equator. Under warming and convective stability changes roughly corresponding to a doubling of CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations from a present-day Earthlike climate, storm tracks shift about 0.8\textdegree{} poleward, somewhat less than but in qualitative agreement with studies using moist GCMs. About 63\% (0.5\textdegree ) of the poleward shift is shown to be caused by tropical convective stability variations. This demonstrates that tropical processes alone (the increased dry static stability of a warmer moist adiabat) can account for part of the poleward shift of storm tracks under global warming. This poleward shift generally occurs in tandem with a poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation; however, the Hadley circulation expansion does not always parallel the storm track shift.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Nonetheless, a generally accepted theory of the mechanisms controlling the storm-track shifts is still lacking. Here, mean available potential energy (MAPE), a general measure of baroclinicity that is proportional to the square of the Eady growth rate, is used to understand storm-track shifts. It is demonstrated that, in dry atmospheres, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) in a storm track is linearly related to the mean available potential energy, relative to a local reference state, and that maxima of the two are generally collocated in latitude. Changes in MAPE with climate are then decomposed into components. It is shown that in simulations of dry atmospheres, changes in the latitude of maximum MAPE are dominated by changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. By contrast, changes in the magnitude of MAPE are primarily determined by changes in static stability and in the depth of the troposphere. A theory of storm-track shifts may build upon these findings and primarily needs to explain changes in near-surface meridional temperature gradients. The terminus of the Hadley circulation often shifts in tandem with storm tracks and is hypothesized to play an important role in triggering the storm-track shifts seen in this idealized dry context, especially in simulations where increases only in the convective static stability in the deep tropics suffice to shift storm tracks poleward.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Much of this cloud optical depth increase has been hypothesized to be due to transitions from ice-dominated to liquid-dominated mixed-phase cloud. In this study, the importance of liquid-ice partitioning for the optical depth feedback is quantified for 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 models. All models show a monotonic partitioning of ice and liquid as a function of temperature, but the temperature at which ice and liquid are equally mixed (the glaciation temperature) varies by as much as 40 K across models. Models that have a higher glaciation temperature are found to have a smaller climatological liquid water path (LWP) and condensed water path and experience a larger increase in LWP as the climate warms. The ice-liquid partitioning curve of each model may be used to calculate the response of LWP to warming. It is found that the repartitioning between ice and liquid in a warming climate contributes at least 20\% to 80\% of the increase in LWP as the climate warms, depending on model. Intermodel differences in the climatological partitioning between ice and liquid are estimated to contribute at least 20\% to the intermodel spread in the high-latitude LWP response in the mixed-phase region poleward of 45\textdegree S. It is hypothesized that a more thorough evaluation and constraint of global climate model mixed-phase cloud parameterizations and validation of the total condensate and ice-liquid apportionment against observations will yield a substantial reduction in model uncertainty in the high-latitude cloud response to warming.},

This separability is evident in several fields throughout most of the year, from hemispheric to synoptic scales. The extent to which the regional response to sea ice loss sometimes agrees with and sometimes cancels the response to CO2 is quantified.

  abstract = {Tropical paleoclimate records provide important insights into the response of precipitation patterns and the Hadley circulation to past climate changes. Paleo-records are commonly interpreted as indicating north\textendash south shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), with the ITCZ's mean position moving toward the warmer hemisphere in response to changes in cross-equatorial temperature gradients. Though a number of records in tropical Central and South America, North Africa, Asia and the Indo-Australian region are consistent with this interpretation, the magnitudes and regional variability of past ITCZ shifts are poorly constrained. Combining estimates of past tropical sea surface temperature (SST) gradients with the strong linear relationship observed between zonally averaged ITCZ position and tropical SST gradients in the modern seasonal cycle and in models of past climates, we quantify past shifts in zonally averaged ITCZ position. We find that mean ITCZ shifts are likely less than 1\textdegree{} latitude during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) and mid-Holocene (6 ka) climates, with the largest shift during HS1. The ITCZ's position is closely tied to heat transport between the hemispheres by the atmosphere and ocean; accordingly, these small mean ITCZ shifts are associated with relatively large ({$\sim$}0.1\textendash 0.4 PW) changes in cross-equatorial atmospheric heat transport (AHTEQ). These AHTEQ changes point to changes in cross-equatorial ocean heat transport or net radiative fluxes of the opposite sign. During HS1, the increase in northward AHTEQ is large enough to compensate for a partial or total shutdown in northward heat transport by the Atlantic Ocean's meridional overturning circulation. The large AHTEQ response for small changes in mean ITCZ position places limits on the magnitude of past shifts in the globally averaged ITCZ. Large ({$\geqslant$}5\textdegree ) meridional displacements of the ITCZ inferred from regional compilations of proxy records must be limited in their zonal extent, and ITCZ shifts at other longitudes must be near zero, for the global mean shift to remain {$\leqslant$}1\textdegree{} as suggested by our results. Our examination of model results and modern observations supports variable regional and seasonal changes in ITCZ precipitation. This work thus highlights the importance of a dense network of tropical precipitation reconstructions to document the regional and seasonal heterogeneity of ITCZ responses to past climate changes.},

The thermal forcings are held constant, and the response of the circulation in each month of the year is explored. First, the circulation responses to tropical warming and polar warming are studied separately, and then the response to the simultaneously applied forcings is analyzed. Finally, the seasonality of the internal variability of the circulation is explored as a possible mechanism to explain the seasonality of the responses. The primary results of these experiments are as follows: 1) There is a seasonal sensitivity in the circulation response to both the tropical and polar forcings. 2) The jet position response to each forcing is greatest in the transition seasons, and the jet speed response exhibits a seasonal sensitivity to both forcings, although the seasonal sensitivities are not the same. 3) The circulation response is nonlinear in the transition seasons, but approximately linear in the winter months. 4) The internal variability of the unforced circulation exhibits a seasonal sensitivity that may partly explain the seasonal sensitivity of the forced response. The seasonality of the internal variability of daily MERRA reanalysis data is compared to that of the model, demonstrating that the broad conclusions drawn from this idealized modeling study may be useful for understanding the jet response to anthropogenic forcing.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Over 50 years ago it was proposed that dry thermals entrain because of buoyancy (via a constraint which requires an increase in the radius a). However, this runs counter to the scaling arguments commonly used to derive the entrainment rate, which rely on either the self-similarity or a turbulent entrainment hypothesis. The assumption of turbulence-driven entrainment has been investigated and it has been found that the entrainment efficiency e varies by less than 20\% between laminar (Re=630) and turbulent (Re=6300) thermals. This motivated us to utilize the argument of buoyancy-controlled entrainment in addition to the thermal's vertical momentum equation to build a model for thermal dynamics which does not invoke turbulence or self-similarity. We derive simple expressions for the thermals' kinematic properties and their fractional entrainment rate {$\epsilon$} and find close quantitative agreement with the values in direct numerical simulations. In particular, our expression for entrainment rate is consistent with the parametrization {$\epsilon\sim$}B/w2, for Archimedean buoyancy B and vertical velocity w. We also directly validate the role of buoyancy-driven entrainment by running simulations where gravity is turned off midway through a thermal's rise. The entrainment efficiency e is observed to drop to less than one third of its original value in both the laminar and turbulent cases when g=0, affirming the central role of buoyancy in entrainment for dry thermals.},

  abstract = {Various studies have suggested that Earth's clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) varies linearly with surface temperature, with a longwave clear-sky feedback that is, independent of surface temperature and relative humidity. However, this uniformity conflicts with the notion that humidity controls tropical stability (e.g., the ``furnace'' and ``radiator fins'' of Pierrehumbert (1995, https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1995)052\%3C1784:TRFATL\%3E2.0.CO;2)). Here, we use a column model to explore the dependence of longwave clear-sky feedback on both surface temperature and relative humidity. We find that a strong humidity dependence in the feedback emerges above 275 K, which stems from the closing of the O window, and that the furnace and radiator fins are consequences of this dependence. We then clarify that radiator fins are better characterized by tropical variations in clear-sky feedback than OLR. Finally, we construct a simple model for estimating the all-sky feedback and find that although clouds lower the magnitude of longwave feedback, the humidity-dependence persists.},

While it is clear that in most regions the average temperature is increasing, there is less consensus regarding the presence or nature of changes in the shape of the distributions, which can influence the probability of extreme events. Using data from over 4000 weather stations in the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily database, we quantify the changes in daily maximum and minimum temperature distributions for peak summer in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes during 1980\textendash 2015 using quantile regression. A large majority (87\textendash 88\%) of the trends across percentiles and stations can be explained by a shift of the distributions with no change in shape. The remaining variability is summarized through projections onto orthogonal basis functions that are closely related to changes in variance, skewness, and kurtosis. North America and Eurasia show significant shifts in the estimated distributions of daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Although no general change in summer variance is found, variance has regionally increased in Eurasia and decreased in most of North America. Changes in shape that project onto the skewness and kurtosis basis functions have a much smaller spatial scale and are generally insignificant.},

Here we present a clustering analysis of daily maximum summer temperatures from US weather stations between 1982\textendash 2015 and identify a region spanning most of the eastern US where hot weather events tend to occur synchronously. We then show that an evolving pattern of sea surface temperature anomalies, termed the Pacific Extreme Pattern, provides for skillful prediction of hot weather within this region as much as 50 days in advance. Skill is demonstrated using out-of-sample predictions between 1950 and 2015. Rainfall deficits over the eastern US are also associated with the occurrence of the Pacific Extreme Pattern and are demonstrated to offer complementary skill in predicting high temperatures. The Pacific Extreme Pattern appears to provide a cohesive framework for improving seasonal prediction of summer precipitation deficits and high temperature anomalies in the eastern~US.},

The aquaplanets capture many of the robust responses of the large-scale circulation and hydrologic cycle to both warming the sea-surface temperature and quadrupling atmospheric CO2. The cloud response to both perturbations varies across models in both Earth-like and aquaplanet configurations, and this spread arises primarily from regions of large-scale subsidence. Most models produce a consistent cloud change across the subsidence regimes, and the feedback in trade-wind cumulus regions dominates the tropical response. It is shown that these trade-wind regions have similar cloud feedback in Earth-like and aquaplanet warming experiments. The tropical average cloud feedback of the Earth-like experiment is captured by five of eight aquaplanets, and the three outliers are investigated to understand the discrepancy. In two models, the discrepancy is due to warming induced dissipation of stratocumulus decks in the Earth-like configuration which are not represented in the aquaplanet. One model shows a circulation response in the aquaplanet experiment accompanied by a cloud response that differs from the Earth-like configuration. Quadrupling atmospheric CO2 in aquaplanets produces slightly greater adjusted forcing than in Earth-like configurations, showing that land-surface effects dampen the adjusted forcing. The analysis demonstrates how aquaplanets, as part of a model hierarchy, help elucidate robust aspects of climate change and develop understanding of the processes underlying them.},

These results are compared to the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4) and include simulations using the representative concentration pathway (RCP) mitigation scenarios, and extensions for those scenarios beyond 2100 to 2300. Equilibrium climate sensitivity of CESM1(CAM5) is 4.10\textdegree C, which is higher than the CCSM4 value of 3.20\textdegree C. The transient climate response is 2.33\textdegree C, compared to the CCSM4 value of 1.73\textdegree C. Thus, even though CESM1(CAM5) includes both the direct and indirect effects of aerosols (CCSM4 had only the direct effect), the overall climate system response including forcing and feedbacks is greater in CESM1(CAM5) compared to CCSM4. The Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in CESM1(CAM5) weakens considerably in the twenty-first century in all the RCP scenarios, and recovers more slowly in the lower forcing scenarios. The total aerosol optical depth (AOD) changes from \textasciitilde 0.12 in 2006 to \textasciitilde 0.10 in 2100, compared to a preindustrial 1850 value of 0.08, so there is less negative forcing (a net positive forcing) from that source during the twenty-first century. Consequently, the change from 2006 to 2100 in aerosol direct forcing in CESM1(CAM5) contributes to greater twenty-first century warming relative to CCSM4. There is greater Arctic warming and sea ice loss in CESM1(CAM5), with an ice-free summer Arctic occurring by about 2060 in RCP8.5 (2040s in September) as opposed to about 2100 in CCSM4 (2060s in September).},

Those elevated GHG concentrations warm the planet and \textendash{} partially offset by net cooling effects by aerosols \textendash{} are largely responsible for the observed warming over the past 150 years. An accurate representation of GHG concentrations is hence important to understand and model recent climate change. So far, community efforts to create composite datasets of GHG concentrations with seasonal and latitudinal information have focused on marine boundary layer conditions and recent trends since the 1980s. Here, we provide consolidated datasets of historical atmospheric concentrations (mole fractions) of 43 GHGs to be used in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project \textendash{} Phase 6 (CMIP6) experiments. The presented datasets are based on AGAGE and NOAA networks, firn and ice core data, and archived air data, and a large set of published studies. In contrast to previous intercomparisons, the new datasets are latitudinally resolved and include seasonality. We focus on the period 1850\textendash 2014 for historical CMIP6 runs, but data are also provided for the last 2000 years. We provide consolidated datasets in various spatiotemporal resolutions for carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}), methane (CH\textsubscript{4}) and nitrous oxide (N\textsubscript{2}O), as well as 40 other GHGs, namely 17 ozone-depleting substances, 11 hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), 9 perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF\textsubscript{6}), nitrogen trifluoride (NF\textsubscript{3}) and sulfuryl fluoride (SO\textsubscript{2}F\textsubscript{2}). In addition, we provide three equivalence species that aggregate concentrations of GHGs other than CO\textsubscript{2}, CH\textsubscript{4} and N\textsubscript{2}O, weighted by their radiative forcing efficiencies. For the year 1850, which is used for pre-industrial control runs, we estimate annual global-mean surface concentrations of CO\textsubscript{2} at 284.3 ppm, CH\textsubscript{4} at 808.2 ppb and N\textsubscript{2}O at 273.0 ppb. The data are available at {$<$}a href="https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/" target="\_blank"{$>$}https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/input4mips/{$<$}/a{$>$} and {$<$}a href="http://www.climatecollege.unimelb.edu.au/cmip6" target="\_blank"{$>$}http://www.climatecollege.unimelb.edu.au/cmip6{$<$}/a{$>$}.

These projections include all major anthropogenic greenhouse gases and are a result of a multi-year effort to produce new scenarios for climate change research. We combine a suite of atmospheric concentration observations and emissions estimates for greenhouse gases (GHGs) through the historical period (1750\textendash 2005) with harmonized emissions projected by four different Integrated Assessment Models for 2005\textendash 2100. As concentrations are somewhat dependent on the future climate itself (due to climate feedbacks in the carbon and other gas cycles), we emulate median response characteristics of models assessed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report using the reduced-complexity carbon cycle climate model MAGICC6. Projected `best-estimate' global-mean surface temperature increases (using inter alia a climate sensitivity of 3\textdegree C) range from 1.5\textdegree C by 2100 for the lowest of the four RCPs, called both RCP3-PD and RCP2.6, to 4.5\textdegree C for the highest one, RCP8.5, relative to pre-industrial levels. Beyond 2100, we present the ECPs that are simple extensions of the RCPs, based on the assumption of either smoothly stabilizing concentrations or constant emissions: For example, the lower RCP2.6 pathway represents a strong mitigation scenario and is extended by assuming constant emissions after 2100 (including net negative CO2 emissions), leading to CO2 concentrations returning to 360~ppm by 2300. We also present the GHG concentrations for one supplementary extension, which illustrates the stringent emissions implications of attempting to go back to ECP4.5 concentration levels by 2250 after emissions during the 21st century followed the higher RCP6 scenario. Corresponding radiative forcing values are presented for the RCP and ECPs.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Anthropogenic increases in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations are the main driver of current and future climate change. The integrated assessment community has quantified anthropogenic emissions for the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP) scenarios, each of which represents a different future socio-economic projection and political environment. Here, we provide the greenhouse gas concentrations for these SSP scenarios \textendash{} using the reduced-complexity climate\textendash carbon-cycle model MAGICC7.0. We extend historical, observationally based concentration data with SSP concentration projections from 2015 to 2500 for 43 greenhouse gases with monthly and latitudinal resolution. CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations by 2100 range from 393 to 1135\&thinsp;ppm for the lowest (SSP1-1.9) and highest (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios, respectively. We also provide the concentration extensions beyond 2100 based on assumptions regarding the trajectories of fossil fuels and land use change emissions, net negative emissions, and the fraction of non-CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. By 2150, CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations in the lowest emission scenario are approximately 350\&thinsp;ppm and approximately plateau at that level until 2500, whereas the highest fossil-fuel-driven scenario projects CO\textsubscript{2} concentrations of 1737\&thinsp;ppm and reaches concentrations beyond 2000\&thinsp;ppm by 2250. We estimate that the share of CO\textsubscript{2} in the total radiative forcing contribution of all considered 43 long-lived greenhouse gases increases from 66\&thinsp;\% for the present day to roughly 68\&thinsp;\% to 85\&thinsp;\% by the time of maximum forcing in the 21st century. For this estimation, we updated simple radiative forcing parameterizations that reflect the Oslo Line-By-Line model results. In comparison to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), the five main SSPs (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are more evenly spaced and extend to lower 2100 radiative forcing and temperatures. Performing two pairs of six-member historical ensembles with CESM1.2.2, we estimate the effect on surface air temperatures of applying latitudinally and seasonally resolved GHG concentrations. We find that the ensemble differences in the March\textendash April\textendash May (MAM) season provide a regional warming in higher northern latitudes of up to 0.4\&thinsp;K over the historical period, latitudinally averaged of about 0.1\&thinsp;K, which we estimate to be comparable to the upper bound ({$\sim$}5\&thinsp;\% level) of natural variability. In comparison to the comparatively straight line of the last 2000 years, the greenhouse gas concentrations since the onset of the industrial period and this studies' projections over the next 100 to 500 years unequivocally depict a ``hockey-stick'' upwards shape. The SSP concentration time series derived in this study provide a harmonized set of input assumptions for long-term climate science analysis; they also provide an indication of the wide set of futures that societal developments and policy implementations can lead to \textendash{} ranging from multiple degrees of future warming on the one side to approximately 1.5\&thinsp;\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}}C warming on the other.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Here we use output from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 to show that a weaker STJ is associated with a more poleward HC edge interannually, but there is a strengthening of the STJ and expansion of the HC in response to increased CO2. The HC expansion caused by increased CO2 is much more rapid than the strengthening of the STJ. It is suggested that the differing response times and relationships between interannual variations and increased CO2 are due to differing sensitivities of the HC and STJ to shifts in the eddy momentum fluxes.},

While ECS is often assumed to be constant to a first order of approximation, recent studies suggested that ECS might depend on the climate state. Here it is shown that the latest generation of climate models consistently exhibits an increasing ECS in warmer climates due to a strengthening of the water-vapor feedback with increasing surface temperatures. The increasing ECS is replicated by a one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium model, which further shows that the enhanced water-vapor feedback follows from the rising of the tropopause in a warming climate. This mechanism is potentially important for understanding both warm climates of Earth's past and projections of future high-emission scenarios.},

The angular momentum balance and energy balance are examined to understand the mechanisms that produce this result. That the summer with stronger insolation has a weaker circulation is the result of an increase in the atmosphere's energetic stratification, the gross moist stability, which increases more than the amount required to balance the change in atmospheric energy flux divergence necessitated by the change in top-of-atmosphere net radiation. The solstice-season changes result in annual-mean Hadley circulation changes (e.g., changes in circulation strength).},

When perihelion occurs in the summer of a hemisphere with a subtropical continent, changes in the top-of-atmosphere energy balance, together with a poleward shift of the monsoonal circulation boundary, lead to a strengthening of the monsoonal circulation. Spatial variations in surface heat capacity determine whether radiative perturbations are balanced by energy storage or by atmospheric energy fluxes. Although orbital precession does not affect annual-mean insolation, the annual-mean Hadley circulation does respond to orbital precession because its sensitivity to radiative changes varies over the course of the year: the monsoonal circulation in summer is near the angular momentum-conserving limit and responds directly to radiative changes; whereas in winter, the circulation is affected by the momentum fluxes of extratropical eddies and is less sensitive to radiative changes.},

These models have a polar amplified warming pattern that is quantitatively similar to general circulation model simulations. Even without surface albedo changes or other spatially varying feedbacks, they simulate polar amplification that results from increased poleward energy transport with warming. Here, two estimates for polar amplification are presented that do not require numerical solution of the EBM governing equation. They are evaluated relative to the results of numerical moist EBM solutions. One estimate considers only changes in a moist thermodynamic quantity (assuming that the increase in energy transport results in a spatially uniform change in moist static energy in the warmed climate) and has more polar amplification than the EBM solution. The other estimate uses a new solution of a truncated form of the moist EBM equation, which allows for a temperature change that is consistent with both the dry and latent energy transport changes, as well as radiative changes. The truncated EBM solution provides an estimate for polar amplification that is nearly identical to that of the numerical EBM solution and only depends on the EBM parameters and climatology of temperature. This solution sheds light on the dependence of polar amplification on the climatological temperature distribution and offers an estimate of the residual polar warming in solar radiation management geoengineered climates.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Compound extremes, which involve extremes in two or more meteorological parameters, have received little attention until now. We present a new global climatology of compound events that involve extreme precipitation and extreme wind and that are triggered by low-pressure systems. The analysis employs the 3-hourly ERA5 reanalysis (1979\textendash 2018) and two independent cyclone detection and tracking algorithms, both of which provide a quasi-Lagrangian perspective. In the analysis, firstly, spatially large and coherent individual extremes in the accumulated precipitation and maximum 10-m wind gust fields are identified. Then cyclone tracks that have both an extreme precipitation and extreme wind event are considered as compound extremes, and these account for 2\textendash 3\% of the total number of cyclones. The main areas where compound extremes occur depend on the season, but can be summarised as the regions over North America, Japan, the Mediterranean, Australia and regions with high tropical cyclone occurrence. In most of the compound events, either both extremes occur at the same time during the cyclone's lifespan or the precipitation extreme sets in earlier than the wind extreme. There is little difference between the geographic distributions of compound and single precipitation extremes, and a similar comment applies to the wind extremes. However, it is striking that the lifetime of cyclones involved in single precipitation extremes are 48\% or 60\% and single wind extremes are 64\% or 82\% of the duration of cyclones associated with compound extremes, depending on the tracking algorithm. The duration of single precipitation extremes is depending on the algorithm 48\% or 53\% as long as compound extremes, while this number is further reduced to 48\% or 51\% in wind extremes. This shows that the single precipitation extremes are proportional to the shorter cyclone lifetime, while the duration of wind extremes are disproportionally reduced with respect to the lifetime in single extremes, indicating that especially wind extremes in compound events can profit from the simultaneous presence of precipitation extremes.},

Similarly, the increasing level of knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy greater visibility, does not necessarily mean that ``big science'' leads to cognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the extents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature independently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles published over 60\textendash 130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method is based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research articles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent stochasticity of article titles to achieve {$<$}1\% precision. We show that the periods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in publication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger teams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of) articles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role of small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries of science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive territory can also be applied to study many other aspects of `science of science.'},

Abrupt thaw and thermokarst could emit a substantial amount of carbon to the atmosphere rapidly (days to years), mobilizing the deep legacy carbon sequestered in Yedoma. Carbon dioxide emissions are proportionally larger than other greenhouse gas emissions in the Arctic, but expansion of anoxic conditions within thawed permafrost and soils stands to increase the proportion of future methane emissions. Increasingly frequent wildfires in the Arctic will also lead to a notable but unpredictable carbon flux. More detailed monitoring though in situ, airborne and satellite observations will provide a deeper understanding of the Arctic's future role as a carbon source or sink, and the subsequent impact on the Earth system.},

How do these anomalies regulate the atmospheric boundary layer state (event self-intensification) and contribute to the inflow of heat and moisture to other regions (event self-propagation)? Can this knowledge on the role of land feedbacks, when available, be exploited to develop geo-engineering mitigation strategies that prevent these events from aggravating during their early stages?

  abstract = {We identify mechanisms controlling the distribution of methane convection and large-scale circulation in a simplified, axisymmetric model atmosphere of Titan forced by gray radiation and moist (methane) convection. The large-scale overturning circulation, or Hadley cell, is global in latitudinal extent and provides fundamental control of precipitation and tropospheric winds. The precipitating, large-scale updraft regularly oscillates in latitude with seasons. The distance of greatest poleward excursion of the Hadley cell updraft is set by the mass of the convective layer of the atmosphere; convection efficiently communicates seasonal warming of the surface through the cold and dense lower atmosphere, increasing the heat capacity of the system. The presence of deep, precipitating convection introduces three effects relative to the case with no methane latent heating: (1) convection is narrowed and enhanced in the large-scale updraft of the Hadley cell; (2) the latitudinal amplitude of Hadley cell updraft oscillations is decreased; and (3) a time lag is introduced. These effects are observable in the location and timing of convective methane clouds in Titan's atmosphere as a function of season. A comparison of simulations over a range of convective regimes with available observations suggest methane thermodynamic\textendash dynamic feedback is important in the Titan climate.},

The transition to superrotation occurs under conditions in which equatorward propagating Rossby waves generated by baroclinic instability at intermediate and high latitudes are suppressed, which will occur when the deformation radius exceeds the planetary radius. At large thermal Rossby numbers following an initial, nearly axisymmetric phase, a global baroclinic wave of zonal wave number one generated by mixed barotropic-baroclinic instability dominates the eddy flux of zonal momentum. The global wave converges eastward zonal momentum to the equator and deposits westward momentum at intermediate latitudes during spin-up and before superrotation emerges, and the baroclinic instability ceases once superrotation is established. A global barotropic mode of zonal wave number one generated by a mix of high- and low-latitude barotropic instability is responsible for maintaining superrotation in the statistically steady state. At intermediate thermal Rossby numbers, momentum flux by the global baroclinic mode is subdominant relative to smaller baroclinic modes, and thus strong superrotation does not develop.},

Currently we do not have a complete quantitative understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of energy balance regimes [e.g., radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) and radiative advective equilibrium (RAE)] and their connection to lapse rate regimes (moist adiabat and surface inversion). Here we use the vertically integrated moist static energy budget to define a nondimensional number that quantifies where and when RCE and RAE are approximately satisfied in Earth's modern climate. We find RCE exists year-round in the tropics and in the northern midlatitudes during summertime. RAE exists year-round over Antarctica and in the Arctic with the exception of early summer. We show that lapse rates in RCE and RAE are consistent with moist adiabatic and surface inversion lapse rates, respectively. We use idealized models (energy balance and aquaplanet) to test the following hypotheses: 1) RCE occurs during midlatitude summer for land-like (small heat capacity) surface conditions, and 2) sea ice is necessary for the existence of annual-mean RAE over a polar ocean, such as the Arctic. Consistent with point 1, an aquaplanet configured with a shallow mixed layer transitions to RCE in the midlatitudes during summertime whereas it does not for a deep mixed layer. Furthermore, we confirm point 2 using mechanism-denial aquaplanet experiments with and without thermodynamic sea ice. Finally, we show energy balance regimes of the modern climate provide a useful guide to the vertical structure of the warming response in the annual mean, and seasonally over the tropics and the southern high latitudes.},

The current version of RRTM calculates fluxes and cooling rates for the longwave spectral region (10\textendash 3000 cm-1) for an arbitrary clear atmosphere. The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated-k method: the k distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line-by-line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high-resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated-k approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m-2 (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10\textendash 3000 cm-1) error of less than 1.0 W m-2 at any altitude; 0.07 K d-1 for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d-1 in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m-2, an error of less than 5\%. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.},

The tropospheric lapse rate {$\gamma$} is about 6.1 K/km in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) as a whole and over the ocean and about 6.2 K/km over the continents. The value of {$\gamma$} decreases from 6.5 K/km at low latitudes to 4.5 K/km at polar latitudes. The values of d{$\gamma$}/dTs, the parameter of sensitivity of {$\gamma$} to the variation of Ts for the NH in the interannual variability, are found to be about 0.04 km-1 (0.041 km-1 for the NH as a whole, 0.042 km-1 over the ocean, and 0.038 km-1 over the continents). This corresponds to an increase in {$\gamma$} of approximately 0.7\% when the surface temperature of the NH is increased by 1 K. Estimates of d{$\gamma$}/dTs vary from about 0.05 km-1 in the subtropics to 0.10 km-1 at polar latitudes. When d{$\gamma$}/dTs is positive, the surface and tropospheric warming means a temperature decrease above a certain critical level Hcr. The height of the level Hcr with constant temperature, which is defined by the inverse value (d{$\gamma$}/dTs)-1, is about 25 km for the NH as a whole, i.e., above the tropopause. In the subtropics, Hcr is about 20 km. At polar latitudes, Hcr decreases to about 10 km. Positive values of d{$\gamma$}/dTs characterize a positive climatic feedback through the lapse rate and indicate a general decrease in the static stability of the troposphere during global warming. Along with a general tendency of {$\gamma$} to increase with rising Ts, there are regional regimes with the opposite tendency, mainly over the ocean. The negative correlation of {$\gamma$} with Ts is found over the oceanic tropics and midlatitudes, in particular, over the oceanic belt around Antarctica.},

Results of a series of atmosphere-only sensitivity studies are shown to demonstrate changes in simulated climate associated with specific changes in physical parameterizations, and the impact of the newly implemented resolution-aware behavior on simulations at different resolutions is demonstrated. The GEOS-5 AGCM presented here is the model used as part of the GMAO MERRA2 reanalysis, global mesoscale simulations at 10 km resolution through 1.5 km resolution, the real-time numerical weather prediction system, and for atmosphere-only, coupled ocean-atmosphere and coupled atmosphere-chemistry simulations. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} The seasonal mean climate of the MERRA2 version of the GEOS-5 AGCM represents a substantial improvement over the simulated climate of the MERRA version at all resolutions and for all applications. Fundamental improvements in simulated climate are associated with the increased re-evaporation of frozen precipitation and cloud condensate, resulting in a wetter atmosphere. Improvements in simulated climate are also shown to be attributable to changes in the background gravity wave drag, and to upgrades in the relationship between the ocean surface stress and the ocean roughness. The series of resolution-aware parameters related to the moist physics was shown to result in improvements at higher resolutions and result in AGCM simulations that exhibit seamless behavior across different resolutions and applications.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The eddies interact with each other and with the jet, affecting the variability on a wide range of scales, but the mechanisms of planetary-scale fluctuations of the jet are not well understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to explore the stability of planetary-scale motions in an idealized two-layer model of the atmosphere. The model is based on a combination of vertical shear and the Sverdrup relation, providing the dynamic link between the two layers, with meridional eddy heat fluxes parameterized as a diffusive process with the memory of past baroclinicity of the jet. We find that a planetary-scale instability exists if the vertical shear of the jet does not exceed a particular threshold. The inclusion of the eddy-memory effect enables westward or eastward propagation of planetary waves relative to the barotropic mean flow. Importantly, we find growing planetary waves that propagate slowly westward or are stationary, which could have important implications for the formation of atmospheric blocking events. Our theoretical results suggest that, with ongoing polar amplification due to global warming and the corresponding reduction of the vertical shear of the mean wind, the background conditions for the growth of planetary-scale waves via planetary-scale baroclinic instability are becoming more favorable.},

To quantify the persistence of this behavior, we examine high-resolution ice core and speleothem data to find pink noise in both pre- and postindustrial periods. We examine the spatial structure with an empirical orthogonal function analysis of the monthly averaged surface temperature from 1901 to 2012. The first mode clearly shows the distribution of ocean heat flux sinks located in the eastern Pacific and the Southern Ocean and has pink-noise characteristics on a multidecadal timescale.

For this reason, the analytical and numerical solutions of a stochastic Arctic sea ice model are analyzed with both additive and multiplicative noise over a wide range of external heat fluxes {$\Delta$}F0, corresponding to greenhouse gas forcing. The stochastic variability fundamentally influences the nature of the deterministic steady-state solutions corresponding to perennial and seasonal ice and ice-free states. Thus, the results are particularly relevant for the interpretation of the state of the system as the ice cover thins with {$\Delta$}F0, allowing a thorough examination of the differing effects of additive versus multiplicative noise. In the perennial ice regime, the principal stochastic moments are calculated and compared to those determined from a stochastic perturbation theory described previously. As {$\Delta$}F0 increases, the competing contributions to the variability of the destabilizing sea ice\textendash albedo feedback and the stabilizing longwave radiative loss are examined in detail. At the end of summer the variability of the stochastic paths shows a clear maximum, which is due to the combination of the increasing influence of the albedo feedback and an associated ``memory effect,'' in which fluctuations accumulate from early spring to late summer. This is counterbalanced by the stabilization of the ice cover resulting from the longwave loss of energy from the ice surface, which is enhanced during winter, thereby focusing the stochastic paths and decreasing the variability. Finally, common examples in stochastic dynamics with multiplicative noise are discussed wherein the choice of the stochastic calculus (It\^o or Stratonovich) is not necessarily determinable a priori from observations alone, which is why both calculi are treated on equal footing herein.},

  abstract = {The midlatitude circulation response to climate change is not well understood. Within an energetic framework the circulation is connected to the atmospheric diffusivity. Here we define a novel diagnostic diffusivity framework as a tool for interpreting changes in the midlatitude atmospheric circulation. The diffusivity is computed by dividing the zonally and vertically integrated transient eddy moist static energy (MSE) transport by the zonal-mean 925 hPa MSE gradient, and we investigate the diffusivity response to global-scale sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations in aquaplanet and Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) general circulation model simulations. The midlatitude diffusivity maximum shifts poleward with increasing SST in both the aquaplanet simulations and Southern Hemisphere winter of the AMIP simulations. Our framework indicates that this diffusivity shift is associated with Ferrel circulation and 925 hPa MSE gradient changes, rather than with total MSE transport changes. The MSE gradient-related shift cannot be understood purely in terms of Clausius-Clapeyron changes in specific humidity following the global-mean temperature response, because atmospheric temperature gradients change significantly even when SST gradients are held fixed. The intensity of the diffusivity maximum also increases with SST for the aquaplanet configuration but is relatively insensitive to SST for AMIP Southern Hemisphere winter. Additional energy balance model experiments suggest that while diffusivity changes caused by SST perturbations can be large, their effect on zonal-mean temperature is minor. Finally, the latitudes and intensities of the diffusivity maxima are strongly correlated with the same properties of the zonal-mean eddy kinetic energy maxima. However, existing theories cannot adequately explain these linear relationships.},

The major simplification made is to ``relax''the state toward equilibrium each time the parameterization is invoked, rather than requiring that the final state be balanced, as in the original Arakawa-Schubert implementation. This relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) scheme is evaluated in off-line tests using the Global Atmospheric Research Programme (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) Phase III data. The results show that RAS is equivalent to the standard implementation of Arakawa-Schubert but is more economical and simpler to code. RAS also avoids the ill-posed problem that occurs in Arakawa-Schubert as a result of having to solve for a balanced state.},

This process allows us to view scalar fields by coloring surfaces and volumes. Unfortunately, the majority of scientific visualization tools still use a color map that is famous for its ineffectiveness: the rainbow color map. This color map, which na\"ively sweeps through the most saturated colors, is well known for its ability to obscure data, introduce artifacts, and confuse users. Although many alternate color maps have been proposed, none have achieved widespread adoption by the visualization community for scientific visualization. This paper explores the use of diverging color maps (sometimes also called ratio, bipolar, or double-ended color maps) for use in scientific visualization, provides a diverging color map that generally performs well in scientific visualization applications, and presents an algorithm that allows users to easily generate their own customized color maps.},

  abstract = {Polar lows (PLs) are high-latitude intense maritime mesoscale weather systems that develop over open water near the sea ice margin or near snow-covered continents during cold air outbreaks. PLs pose a threat to coastal and island communities, transportation and offshore drilling platforms. PLs mainly develop during the cold season and their frequency exhibits a large interannual variability. Observations from polar-orbiting satellites are the main source of observational data to study PLs since conventional observations are sparse and unevenly distributed in high latitudes. PL forecasting has long remained a challenge due to the small size and short lifetime of these systems. Nevertheless, the representation of PLs in numerical models has significantly improved with the advent of high-resolution atmospheric models. Several studies have shown that baroclinic instability and convection play an important role in the development of PLs, but a thorough understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in the formation and intensification of PLs is yet to be developed. The relevant role of surface sensible heat flux and latent heat release in PL development has often been highlighted. The diabatic fluxes from the oceanic surface and associated with PLs can cause a decrease in the sea surface temperature (SST), whereas the strong wind speeds can lead to upper-ocean mixing in regions where an ocean temperature inversion is present. It is expected that global warming associated with anthropogenic climate changes may lead to an increase in the static stability of the atmosphere, thus affecting the climatology of PLs. In the North Atlantic the regions of PL activity will shift northwards as seasonal sea-ice margins migrate towards higher latitudes areas, and the frequency of PLs will decrease. Although our knowledge about PLs has significantly increased during the last decades, the are still many unanswered questions. Among the most pressing issues in PL research are the need to determine the objective criteria that define PLs and to devise an international intercomparison project of PL detection and tracking.},

Assessing feedback between clouds and sea ice as the Arctic loses sea ice cover is important because of clouds' radiative impacts on the Arctic surface. Here we investigate present-day and future Arctic cloud-sea ice relationships in a fully coupled global climate model forced by business-as-usual increases in greenhouse gases. Model evaluation using a lidar simulator and lidar satellite observations shows agreement between present-day modeled and observed cloud-sea ice relationships. Summer clouds are unaffected by sea ice variability, but more fall clouds occur over open water than over sea ice. Because the model reproduces observed cloud-sea ice relationships and their underlying physical mechanisms, the model is used to assess future Arctic cloud-sea ice feedback. With future sea ice loss, modeled summer cloud fraction, vertical structure, and optical depth barely change. Future sea ice loss does not influence summer clouds, but summer sea ice loss does drive fall cloud changes by increasing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the summertime ocean and the latent and sensible heat released into the atmosphere when the Sun sets in fall. The future fall boundary layer deepens and clouds become more opaque over newly open water. The future nonsummer longwave cloud radiative effect strengthens as nonsummer cloud cover increases. In summary, we find no evidence for a summer cloud-sea ice feedback but strong evidence for a positive cloud-sea ice feedback that emerges during nonsummer months as the Arctic warms and sea ice disappears.},

Yet the processes triggering melt and causing its large interannual variability are not well understood. Here we show that melt onset over Arctic sea ice is initiated by positive anomalies of water vapor, clouds, and air temperatures that increase the downwelling longwave radiation (LWD) to the surface. The earlier melt onset occurs; the stronger are these anomalies. Downwelling shortwave radiation (SWD) is smaller than usual at melt onset, indicating that melt is not triggered by SWD. When melt occurs early, an anomalously opaque atmosphere with positive LWD anomalies preconditions the surface for weeks preceding melt. In contrast, when melt begins late, clearer than usual conditions are evident prior to melt. Hence, atmospheric processes are imperative for melt onset. It is also found that spring LWD increased during recent decades, consistent with trends toward an earlier melt onset.},

At the same time, agricultural practices can modify temperatures by altering the surface energy budget. Here we identify centennial trends towards more favourable growing conditions in the US Midwest, including cooler summer temperature extremes and increased precipitation, and investigate the origins of these shifts. Statistically significant correspondence is found between the cooling pattern and trends in cropland intensification, as well as with trends towards greater irrigated land over a small subset of the domain. Land conversion to cropland, often considered an important influence on historical temperatures, is not significantly associated with cooling. We suggest that agricultural intensification increases the potential for evapotranspiration, leading to cooler temperatures and contributing to increased precipitation. The tendency for greater evapotranspiration on hotter days is consistent with our finding that cooling trends are greatest for the highest temperature percentiles. Temperatures over rainfed croplands show no cooling trend during drought conditions, consistent with evapotranspiration requiring adequate soil moisture, and implying that modern drought events feature greater warming as baseline cooler temperatures revert to historically high extremes.},

Hot extremes have been shown to be induced by surface moisture deficits in some regions. In this study, we assess whether such a relationship holds at the global scale. We find that wide areas of the world display a strong relationship between the number of hot days in the regions' hottest month and preceding precipitation deficits. The occurrence probability of an above-average number of hot days is over 70\% after precipitation deficits in most parts of South America as well as the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Australia, and over 60\% in most of North America and Eastern Europe, while it is below 30\textendash 40\% after wet conditions in these regions. Using quantile regression analyses, we show that the impact of precipitation deficits on the number of hot days is asymmetric, i.e. extreme high numbers of hot days are most strongly influenced. This relationship also applies to the 2011 extreme event in Texas. These findings suggest that effects of soil moisture-temperature coupling are geographically more widespread than commonly assumed.},

The results reveal systematic ET biases in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations, with an overestimation in most regions, especially in Europe, Africa, China, Australia, Western North America, and part of the Amazon region. The global average overestimation amounts to 0.17 mm/d. This bias is more pronounced than in the previous CMIP3 ensemble (overestimation of 0.09 mm/d). Consistent with the ET overestimation, precipitation is also overestimated relative to existing reference data sets. We suggest that the identified biases in ET can explain respective systematic biases in temperature in many of the considered regions. The biases additionally display a seasonal dependence and are generally of opposite sign (ET underestimation and temperature overestimation) in boreal summer (June\textendash August).},

Temporal filtering is used to distinguish the effects of transients having synoptic lime scales (i.e., periods less than approximately seven days) from those having longer time scales. Convergences of transient eddy transports of heat and vorticity during blocking conditions are computed from highpass-filtered time series. The eddy flux convergences for individual blocking events are then composited according to the locations of the blocks. The quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equation relating geopotential tendency and the eddy flux convergences of heat and vorticity is solved for composite blocking conditions. The diagnosis is performed for both observed blocks and blocks simulated by a general circulation model. The net quasi-geostrophic geopotential tendencies due to transports by the synoptic-scale transient eddies exhibit a quadrature relationship with the blocking pattern throughout the troposphere, with anticyclonic eddy forcing being located about one-quarter wavelength upstream of the blocking anticyclone. The net quasi-geo- strophic temperature tendencies due to transports by the synoptic-scale transient eddies tend to be out of phase with the temperature perturbations of the block. These relationships were reproducible in all of the observed and model blocking events examined. The effects of transient disturbances on blocking flows as depicted by our diagnostic technique are contrasted with those for earlier studies. Reasons for the inconsistencies in the results of earlier studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract South Asian monsoon depressions are convectively coupled cyclonic vortices that form and intensify in a region of easterly vertical shear of the horizontal wind. Observations of maximum precipitation downshear of the cyclonic center have led to prior theories of quasigeostrophic (QG) control of moist convection in these storms. This study examines the interaction between adiabatic QG lifting and moist convection in monsoon depressions using an atmospheric reanalysis and idealized model. Inversion of the QG omega equation in the reanalysis shows that in the downshear, heavily precipitating region, adiabatic QG ascent, due to advection of vorticity and temperature, is comparable to diabatic ascent in the lower troposphere, while diabatic ascent dominates in the middle and upper troposphere. The causal influence of adiabatic QG lifting on precipitating ascent in monsoon depressions is then examined in the column QG modeling framework, where moist convection evolves in the presence of vorticity and temperature advection. The heavy observed precipitation rates are only simulated when moist convective heating amplifies QG ascent, with this interaction accounting for roughly 40\% of the increase in precipitation relative to the basic state. Another 40\% of this increase is produced by enhanced surface wind speed in the surface enthalpy flux parameterization, which represents the effect of cyclonic winds in the monsoon depression. Horizontal advection of the mean-state poleward moisture gradient accounts for the remaining 20\% of the precipitation increase. In the upshear region, adiabatic QG subsidence and horizontal moisture advection both suppress precipitation, and are opposed by wind-enhanced surface enthalpy fluxes.},

However, potential changes in the blocking area (size), which can affect the spatiotemporal characteristics of the resulting extreme events, have not received much attention. Using two large-ensemble, fully coupled general circulation model (GCM) simulations, we show that the size of blocking events increases with climate change, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere (by as much as 17\%). Using a two-layer quasi-geostrophic model and a dimensional analysis technique, we derive a scaling law for the size of blocking events, which shows that area mostly scales with width of the jet times the Kuo scale (i.e., the length of stationary Rossby waves). The scaling law is validated in a range of idealized GCM simulations. Predictions of this scaling law agree well with changes in blocking events' size under climate change in fully coupled GCMs in winters but not in summers.},

Composite satellite and rawinsonde data are used to compute the rate of storage of energy in the atmosphere, the net radiation flux at the top of the atmosphere, and the energy fluxes across 70\textdegree N and 70\textdegree S, while the energy flux across the Earth's surface is estimated as a residual. Data produced by a general circulation model are used to obtain plausible estimates of the energy flux across 70\textdegree S, where direct estimates tend to be poor. We find that the heat exchange between the atmosphere and the ocean-cryosphere system plays a much larger role in the Arctic than in the Antarctic polar cap. When the polar caps are extended from 70\textdegree{} to 60\textdegree{} latitude, both the land-sea distributions and the different terms balancing the energy budgets become more comparable between the two regions.},

Despite the ubiquity of blocking, the onset mechanism is not well understood. Here we demonstrate a close analogy between blocking and traffic congestion on a highway by using meteorological data and show that blocking and traffic congestion can be described by a common mathematical theory. The theory predicts that the jet stream has a capacity for the flux of wave activity (a measure of meandering), just as the highway has traffic capacity, and when the capacity is exceeded, blocking manifests as congestion. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream's capacity for transient waves and localize block formation. Climate change likely affects blocking frequency by modifying the jet stream's proximity to capacity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Simple proem models have been developed to investigate the role of atmosphere-ocean feedbacks in the stability of the current mode of the thermohaline circulation in the North Atlantic. A positive feedback between the meridional atmospheric transport of moisture and the high-latitude sinking thermohaline circulation (EMT feedback) has been found to help destabilize the latter. The minimum perturbation required to shut off the high-latitude sinking is considerably smaller when this feedback is included. Also, the high-latitude sinking is shut off much faster with this feedback than without it, given a perturbation of the same magnitude. There is also a strong positive feedback between atmospheric heat transport and the thermohaline circulation, but this can be modeled accurately on the global scale by using a properly tuned Newtonian cooling law for the surface beat flux. Idealized flux adjustment experiments suggest that the sensitivity of the real climate is not represented well in coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models that require 0(1) adjustments in the surface fluxes of heat and freshwater to simulate the current climate.},

  abstract = {Abstract An exact diagnostic formalism for finite-amplitude eddy\textendash mean flow interaction is developed for barotropic and quasigeostrophic baroclinic flows on the beta plane. Based on the advection\textendash diffusion\textendash reaction equation for potential vorticity (PV), the formalism quantifies both advective and diffusive contributions to the mean flow modification by eddies, of which the latter is the focus of the present article. The present theory adopts a hybrid Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian-mean description of the flow and defines finite-amplitude wave activity in terms of the areal displacement of PV contours from zonal symmetry. Unlike previous formalisms, wave activity is readily calculable from data and the local Eliassen\textendash Palm relation does not involve cubic or higher-order terms in eddy amplitude. This leads to a natural finite-amplitude extension to the local nonacceleration theorem, as well as the global stability theorems, in the inviscid and unforced limit. The formalism incorporates mixing with effective diffusivity of PV, and the diffusive flux of PV is shown to be a sink of wave activity. The relationship between the advective and diffusive fluxes of PV and its implications for parameterization are discussed in the context of wave activity budget. If all momentum associated with wave activity were returned to the zonal-mean flow, a balanced eddy-free flow would ensue. It is shown that this hypothetical flow uREF is unaffected by the advective PV flux and is driven solely by the diffusive PV flux and forcing. For this reason, uREF, rather than the zonal-mean flow, is proposed as a diagnostic for the diffusive mean-flow modification. The formalism is applied to a freely decaying beta-plane turbulence to evaluate the contribution of the diffusive PV flux to the jet formation.},

Wave activity is defined in terms of an instantaneous areal displacement of QG potential vorticity (PV) from zonal symmetry. Unlike previous forms, the tendency of wave activity equals exactly the negative of the eddy PV flux (Eliassen\textendash Palm flux divergence) in the conservative limit, even at finite amplitude. This allows one to integrate the transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) theory in time and quantify the departure (adiabatic adjustment) of the zonal-mean state from an eddy-free reference state in terms of the observed wave activity. The structure of wave activity identifies synoptic eddies in the extratropics and planetary waves in the high latitudes of winter-to-spring stratosphere. In addition, a thin layer of high wave activity is found at the top of the lowermost stratosphere ({$\sim$}17 km) in the summer extratropics. The reference state is constructed by ``zonalizing'' the PV contours conservatively (preserving area) on the isobaric surface and by inverting the resultant PV gradient for the mean flow. The adjustment associated with wave activity depends on the assumed surface boundary condition for the reference state. With a no-slip condition, the observed zonal-mean temperature is on average {$\sim$}33 (90) K higher than the reference state in the troposphere (stratosphere) of the Arctic winter, while the zonal-mean zonal wind is {$\sim$}30 m s-1 slower in the upper stratosphere. Since the reference state filters out the advective eddy\textendash mean flow interaction, it fluctuates less than the zonal-mean state, potentially improving the signal-to-noise ratio for climate diagnosis.},

The Rossby wave activity density A is proportional to Kelvin's circulation around the wavy potential vorticity (PV) contour minus that around the zonal circle that encloses the same isentropic mass. A quasi-conservative, eddy-free reference state flow uREF is constructed from the observed Kelvin's circulation by zonalizing the PV contours conservatively while enforcing gradient balance. The departure of the observed zonal-mean flow of the atmosphere from the reference state is defined as the net adjustment by the eddies. Then {$\Delta$}u is further partitioned into the direct eddy drag -A and the residual impulse {$\Delta$}uR consistent with the time-integrated transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) zonal-wind equation. The analyzed climatological-mean wave activity in the 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis (ERA-40) is similar to that in Part I. The net adjustment {$\Delta$}u is mainly due to the direct eddy drag ({$\Delta$}u {$\approx$} -A) in the winter polar stratosphere and can reach approximately -60 m s-1 in the Northern Hemisphere. In the extratropical troposphere {$\Delta$}u is a small residual ({$\Delta$}uR {$\approx$} A), yet it clearly reveals a 5\textendash 6 m s-1 eddy driving of the Southern Hemisphere jet as well as a 7\textendash 8 m s-1 eddy drag in the subtropical upper troposphere of both hemispheres. The local maxima in wave activity in the equatorial upper troposphere and the extratropical lower stratosphere found in Part I are undetected, while negative wave activity is found where the isentropes intersect the ground. As in the QG case, uREF exhibits significantly less transient and interannual variability than , implying a better signal-to-noise ratio as a climate variable.},

Baroclinic wave activity at each grid point is represented for each day by an envelope function, the lowpass-filtered time series of the squared highpass-filtered geopotential height. Baroclinic wave activity over the Atlantic exhibits a single maximum in January, whereas in the Pacific it exhibits peaks in late autumn and in early spring and a significant weakening in midwinter, which is more evident at the tropopause level than near the surface. This suppression occurs despite the fact that the low-level baroclinity and the intensity of the jet stream are strongest in midwinter.Based on the analysis of 31-day running mean fields for individual winters, it is shown that over both the oceans baroclinic wave activity is positively correlated with the strength of the upper-tropospheric jet for wind speeds up to {$\sim$}45 m s-1. When the strength of the westerlies exceeds this optimal value, as it usually does over the western Pacific during midwinter, the correlation is negative: wave amplitude and the meridional fluxes of heat and zonal momentum all decrease with increasing wind speed. The phase speed of the waves increases with wind speed, while the steering level drops, which is indicative of the increasing effects of the mean flow advection and the trapping of the waves near the surface.},

The model is a generalization of the area analysis method devised by Butchart and Remsberg but uses the mass element enclosed by the contours of a quasi-conservative tracer on a given isentropic surface as a ``meridional'' coordinate. This modified Lagrangian-mean coordinate is transparent to the advective effects of the winds, and thus unambiguously extracts the nonconservative effects on the tracer distribution. The derived transport equation takes an equivalent advective form; that is, the tracer contours are ``advected'' by the mean nonconservative mass flow while them are no ``eddy flux'' contributions. Hence, the mass flux is implied in the motion of the tracer contours. Not only is this model conceptually simple, it is also computationally economical for analyzing large, high-resolution datasets since time averaging can be omitted to define a robust mean field of the tracer. The model is used to diagnose the N2O mixing ratio and potential vorticity simulated in the high-resolution, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory SKYHI GCM. The analysis not only identifies the boundary of the polar vortex better than the Eulerian zonal-mean models but highlights how the nonconservative processes (diabatic heating and friction) contribute to the formation of the vortex edge. It also reveals the different kinematics for potential vorticity and chemical tracers.},

  abstract = {Abstract A number of idealized life-cycle simulations of baroclinically unstable waves are systematically analyzed to study the effects of eddy momentum flux and of zonal mean horizontal shear on the finite-amplitude evolution of the waves. Twenty-level quasigeostrophic and primitive equation models with channel geometry are numerically integrated with the most unstable linear normal mode as an initial condition. The flows are inviscid except for weak second-order horizontal diffusion. It is found that the finite-amplitude baroclinic waves are sensitively influenced by the vertically integrated eddy momentum flux of the normal mode via the large barotropic shear it spins up in the mean flow. This ``barotropic governor'' mechanism prevents the eddy from attaining all the available potential energy stored in the domain, leading to irreversible barotropic decay. Only in the purely baroclinic, f-plane, quasigeostrophic problem, where the vertically integrated eddy momentum flux identically vanishes due to symmetry, is the growth of baroclinic waves unaffected by the barotropic governor and bounded solely by the total available potential energy. Barotropic shear in the basic flow, the earth's spherical geometry, and nonquasigeostrophic motion all introduce spatial asymmetry into the normal mode, whose nonlinear evolution therefore rapidly departs from the purely baroclinic solution. The details of the departure depend sensitively on the shape of the initial asymmetry, however. The results suggest the natural tendency of baroclinic waves toward barotropic decay in nearly inviscid atmospheres.},

This factor is called ``mixing efficiency'' and it is proposed as a diagnostic of mixing. The mixing efficiency diagnostic is demonstrated using potential vorticity and nitrous oxide from the outputs of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) SKYHI general circulation model (GCM) analyzed on the 320-K isentropic surface for the month of March. It is found that mixing is severely suppressed along the jet axes at the midlatitude tropopause with marked zonal localization in the Northern Hemisphere.

  abstract = {Abstract Time evolutions of prominent blocking flow configurations over the North Pacific and Europe are compared based upon composites for the 30 strongest events observed during 27 recent winter seasons. Fluctuations associated with synoptic-scale migratory eddies have been filtered out before the compositing. A quasi-stationary wave train across the Atlantic is evident during the blocking amplification over Europe, while no counterpart is found to the west of the amplifying blocking over the North Pacific. Correlation between the tropopause-level potential vorticity (PV) and meridional wind velocity associated with the amplifying blocking is found to be negative over Europe in association with the anticyclonic evolution of the low-PV center, but it is almost zero over the North Pacific. Feedback from the synoptic-scale eddies, as evaluated in the form of 250-mb geopotential height tendency due to the eddy vorticity flux convergence, accounts for more than 75\% of the observed amplification for the Pacific blocking and less than 45\% for the European blocking. This difference is highlighted in two types of ``contour advection with surgery'' experiments. In one of them PV contours observed four days before the peak blocking time were advected by composite time series of the low-pass-filtered observational wind, and in the other experiment they were advected by the low-pass-filtered wind from which the transient eddy feedback evaluated as above had been removed at every time step. Hence, the latter data should be dominated by low-frequency dynamics. For the European blocking both experiments can reproduce the anticyclonic evolution of low-PV air within a blocking ridge as observed. For the Pacific blocking, in contrast, the observed intrusion of low-PV air into the higher latitudes cannot be reproduced without the transient feedback. Furthermore, in a barotropic model initialized with the composite 250-mb flow observed three days before the peak time, a simulated blocking development over the North Pacific is more sensitive to the insertion of the observed transient feedback than that over Europe. These results suggest that the incoming wave activity flux associated with a quasi-stationary Rossby wave train is of primary importance in the blocking formation over Europe, whereas the forcing by the synoptic-scale transients is indispensable to that over the North Pacific.},

Effects of a realistic vertical thermal structure of the environment and the related nongeostrophic wind are investigated in detail. Both short (mesoscale) waves trapped in the lower layer with a small static stability and long waves extending throughout the column are unstable, which supports Blumen's results. The integral constraints imply that the vertical structure of the stratification can provide an ``internal lid'' to confine the wave into the mixed layer. Nongeostrophic effects become important as Richardson number decreases as pointed out by Stone; the scale of the most unstable Eady's mode becomes sensitive to the change of shear, unlike the geostrophic case. The measure of the horizontal scale of the disturbance is the modified Rossby radius of deformationwhere {$\Lambda$} is the vertical shear and provides O(Ri-{$\frac{1}{2}$}) correction to the conventional definition. However this shear dependence is drastically different between the full nongeostrophic system and the one with geostrophic momentum approximation. Another nongeostrophic mode\textemdash the weakly unstable, small-scale waves found by Stone\textemdash is identified as an instability due to the inertia critical layer which is sustained by the resonance between one of the boundary modes and inertia\textendash gravity modes. It is analytically shown that this mode may exist even without one of the boundaries, unlike Eady's mode. The growth rates and the shallow structure of the most unstable short Eady waves are generally in agreement with observed early stages of winter storms (coastal cyclogenesis, polar lows, and comma clouds), though some observed cases have a considerably deep structure.},

Typical behaviors of Le2 in various flow regimes are illustrated using the numerically simulated Kelvin-Helmholtz billow. Signature of mixing is found in the irreversible growth of Le2, but the precise time dependence is complex due to interplay between advection and diffusion. Formation of the edges (concentrated gradients) and their permeability to mass are addressed using a kinematic model with prescribed Le2.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Many fundamental questions remain about the roles and effects of stationary forcing on atmospheric blocking. As such, this work utilizes an idealized moist general circulation model (GCM) to investigate atmospheric blocking in terms of dynamics, geographical location, and duration. The model is first configured as an aquaplanet, then orography is added in separate integrations. Block-centered composites of wave activity fluxes and height show that blocks in the aquaplanet undergo a realistic dynamical evolution when compared to reanalysis. Blocks in the aquaplanet are also found to have similar life cycles to blocks in model integrations with orography. These results affirm the usefulness of both zonally symmetric and asymmetric idealized model configurations for studying blocking. Adding orography to the model leads to an increase in blocking. This mirrors what is observed when comparing the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), where the NH contains more orography and thus more blocking. As the prescribed mountain height increases, so do the magnitude and size of climatological stationary waves, resulting in more blocking overall. Increases in blocking, however, are not spatially uniform. Orography is found to induce regions of enhanced block frequency just upstream of mountains, near high pressure anomalies in the stationary waves, which is poleward of climatological minima in upper-level zonal wind, while block frequency minima and jet maxima occur eastward of the wave trough. This result matches what is observed near the Rocky Mountains. Finally, an analysis of block duration suggests blocks generated near stationary wave maxima last slightly longer than blocks that form far from or without orography. Overall, the results of this work help to explain some of the observed similarities and differences in blocking between the NH and SH and emphasize the importance of general circulation features in setting where blocks most frequently occur.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The results indicate that the current GISS model has a high sensitivity with a global annual warming of about 4\textdegree C for doubled CO2 . Enhanced warming is found at higher latitudes near sea-ice margins due to retreat of sea ice in the greenhouse experiment. Surface warming is larger in winter than in summer, in part because of the reductions in ice cover and thickness that insulate the winter atmosphere from the ocean. The annual mean reduction of sea-ice cover due to doubled CO2 is about 30\% for the Northern Hemisphere. The CO2 experiment has a 70\% reduction of sea-ice area and 55\% thinning of ice in August in the Northern Hemisphere. Noticeable reduction of sea-ice cover has been found in both historical records and satellite observations.

Qualitatively similar changes occur during El Ni\~no interannual variability. Using an intermediate climate model, we have identified a mechanism that creates regional reductions in precipitation at the margins of convection zones during warming. In this ``upped-ante mechanism'', a warm troposphere increases the value of surface boundary layer moisture required for convection to occur. In regions of plentiful moisture supply, moisture simply rises to maintain precipitation, but this increases the moisture gradient relative to neighboring subsidence regions. Reductions in rainfall then result for those margins of convection zones that have strong inflow of air from the subsidence regions and less frequently meet the increased ``ante'' for convection. In simulations analyzed here, this new mechanism is the leading cause of tropical drought in the global warming case and is dominant in certain El Ni\~no drought regions.},

A central goal is to establish the performance of state-of-the-art boundary-layer schemes for weather and climate models for this cloud regime, using large-eddy simulations of the same scenes as a reference. A novelty is that the comparison covers four different cases instead of one, in order to broaden the covered parameter space. Three cases are situated in the North-Eastern Pacific, while one reflects conditions in the North-Eastern Atlantic. A set of variables is considered that reflects key aspects of the transition process, making use of simple metrics to establish the model performance. Using this method, some longstanding problems in low-level cloud representation are identified. Considerable spread exists among models concerning the cloud amount, its vertical structure, and the associated impact on radiative transfer. The sign and amplitude of these biases differ somewhat per case, depending on how far the transition has progressed. After cloud breakup the ensemble median exhibits the well-known ``too few too bright'' problem. The boundary-layer deepening rate and its state of decoupling are both underestimated, while the representation of the thin capping cloud layer appears complicated by a lack of vertical resolution. Encouragingly, some models are successful in representing the full set of variables, in particular, the vertical structure and diurnal cycle of the cloud layer in transition. An intriguing result is that the median of the model ensemble performs best, inspiring a new approach in subgrid parameterization.},

The CRM is used to simulate a region of the atmosphere with a positive SST anomaly, and the large-scale circulation in this region is represented using the weak-temperature-gradient and damped-gravity-wave parameterizations where, the large-scale vertical velocity within the domain is related to the deviation of the simulated density profile from a reference profile representative of the tropical mean state. The behavior of the circulation in response to an increase in SST of both the domain and reference state (i.e., uniform warming) is examined. While the vertical velocity shows an increase in its maximum strength with warming, its value in the lower to mid-troposphere decreases. Since the water vapor concentration is largest in the lower troposphere, this leads to a dynamic weakening of precipitation under warming. In order to understand these results, a simple model for the thermodynamic structure of a convecting atmosphere based on a bulk entraining plume is employed. The model uses a fixed entrainment rate and the relative humidity profiles from the CRM to predict the temperature profiles of the domain and reference state. The vertical velocity profiles calculated from these predicted temperature profiles reproduce important aspects of those simulated with the CRM. This simple modeling framework reveals that the effect of entrainment is crucial to understanding the dynamic response of precipitation to warming, providing a stepping stone to understanding the factors driving changes to the tropical precipitation distribution in a future warmer climate.},

The resulting energy surplus is exported from the Indo-Pacific by the ocean circulation and lost to the atmosphere from other ocean basins. This heat transport ultimately sustains much of the buoyancy lost to deep water formation at high latitudes, a key component of the global overturning circulation. Despite the fundamental link between inter-basin ocean heat transport and global overturning in today's climate, there is no general understanding of how these phenomena vary with climate state. Here, we use an unprecedented suite of fully-coupled climate model simulations, equilibrated for thousands of years to a wide range of CO2 levels, to demonstrate that major differences in overturning between climates are related to systematic shifts in ocean heat transport between basins. Uniformly, equilibration to higher CO2 levels strengthens inter-basin ocean heat transport and global deep water formation. These changes are sustained by increased surface heat uptake within the Indo-Pacific oceans, and increased high-latitude heat loss outside of the Indo-Pacific oceans as the climate warms. However, poleward heat transport and high-latitude heat loss do not increase symmetrically between hemispheres. Between glacial and modern-like states, North Atlantic heat loss intensifies and overturning in the Atlantic strengthens. In contrast, between modern-like and hot climates, heat loss and overturning strengthens in the Southern Ocean. We propose that these differences are linked to a shift in the relative efficiency of northward and southward ocean heat transport \textemdash{} dominated by advection in the North Atlantic and eddy diffusion in the Southern Ocean \textemdash{} with climate state. Our results suggest that, under high CO2, future ocean heat transport towards Antarctica would increase disproportionately compared to its changes since the last ice age.},

For the CFSR, the primary source of deviation compared to other reanalyses is the stronger northward component of ice velocity, which results in stronger sea ice advection and divergence. Anomalous surface currents in the CFSR are proposed to be the main cause of the ice velocity anomaly. Furthermore, twice the mean ice thickness in the CFSR compared to other reanalyses makes it more susceptible to wind and oceanic stresses under Coriolis forces, exacerbating the northward drift of sea ice. The C-GLORSv7, GLORYS12v1 and NEMO-EnKF have some underestimation of the contribution of advection and divergence to changes in SIC in autumn, winter and spring compared to observations, but are more reasonable in summer. ORAS5, although using the same coupled model and atmospheric forcing as C-GLORSv7 and GLORYS12v1, has a more significant underestimation of advection and divergence to changes in SIC compared to these two reanalyses. The results of the SIC budgets of five ocean-sea ice reanalyses in the Southern Ocean suggest that future reanalyses should focus on improving the modelling of sea ice velocities, for example through assimilation of sea ice drift observations.},

  abstract = {The early Eocene greenhouse climate maintained by high atmospheric CO2 concentrations serves as a testbed for future climate changes dominated by increasing CO2 forcing. In particular, the early Eocene Arctic region is important in the context of future CO2 driven climate warming in the northern polar region and associated shrinking Arctic sea ice. Here, we present early Eocene Arctic sea ice simulations carried out by six coupled climate models within the framework of the Deep-Time Model Intercomparison Project (DeepMIP). We find differences in sea ice responses to CO2 changes across the ensemble and compare the results with available proxy-based sea ice reconstructions from the Arctic Ocean. Most of the models simulate seasonal sea ice presence at high CO2 levels ({$\geq$} 840 ppmv\,=\,3\texttimes{} pre-industrial (PI) level of 280 ppmv). However, the threshold when sea ice permanently disappears from the ocean varies considerably between the models (from {$<$}840 ppmv to {$>$}1680 ppmv). Based on a one-dimensional energy balance model analysis we find that the greenhouse effect likely caused by increased atmospheric water vapor concentration plays an important role in the inter-model spread in Arctic winter surface temperature changes in response to a CO2 rise from 1\texttimes{} to 3\texttimes{} the PI level. Furthermore, differences in simulated surface salinity in the Arctic Ocean play an important role in the control of local sea ice formation. These differences result from different implementations of river run-off between the models, but also from differences in the exchange of waters between a brackish Arctic and a more saline North Atlantic Ocean that are controlled by the width of the gateway between both basins. As there is no geological evidence for Arctic sea ice in the early Eocene, its presence in most of the simulations with 3\texttimes{} PI CO2 level indicates either a higher CO2 level and/or an overly weak polar sensitivity in these models.},

  abstract = {Interaction between steady, large-scale atmospheric circulations and a radiative-convective environment is considered. As a model tool, we use a two-column radiative-convective model with an explicit hydrological cycle that uses clear-sky conditions in the radiation calculation. A flow field is calculated by the linearized, hydrostatic equations of motion in a non-rotating frame of reference. Mechanical damping is represented by vertical diffusion of momentum and surface drag. the flow advects heat and moisture, and thereby modifies the local radiative-convective equilibrium. A dynamically passive ocean mixed layer is situated below the model atmosphere. All externally specified parameters are identical in the two columns, implying that local radiative-convective equilibrium is a steady solution. For weak mechanical damping (or small column length), the local equilibrium is generally unstable due to a positive feedback between large-scale subsidence and infrared cooling, which operates via advective drying. A circulating equilibrium, in which the air ascends in one column and descends in the other, is attained. Due to a reduced content of clear-sky water vapour, which is the major infrared absorber in the model, the circulating equilibrium can emit the absorbed solar radiation at a significantly lower surface temperature than the corresponding local equilibrium. In the limit of a nearly inviscid atmosphere, the intensity of the large-scale circulation is controlled chiefly by the mid-tropospheric radiative cooling in the downdraught column. In this regime, we find two distinct equilibria with circulation that are distinguished by the features of the downdraught column: one branch with deep convection but where the integrated convective heating vanishes due to evaporation of precipitation; and one branch with shallow (or no) convection where the surface boundary layer is disconnected from the free atmosphere.},

The decrease in fractional coverage of low clouds is key to evaluating cloud radiative effects, because changes in shortwave cloud radiative effects overwhelm those of longwave cloud radiative effects. Thus, improved evaluation of low clouds is important, even in high-resolution climate simulations. An analysis of heat redistribution by explicitly computed clouds revealed that column-integrated heating rate due to phase changes correlates highly with vertical velocity at the altitude corresponding to 500 hPa and is closely linked to column water vapor, similar to the present climate result. Using data from year 1 to year 5, the effective climate sensitivity was evaluated to be 3.6-3.7\textdegree C. Possible convective aggregation is also examined using an index of modified subsidence fraction and characteristic changes in the number of cold pools. Despite previous idealized-planet simulations showing more aggregated tropical convection under warmer conditions, here we show a decrease in the subsidence fraction and an increase in the number of smaller cold pools, suggesting that it is possible to realize less convective organization with warming under real atmospheric conditions.},

  abstract = {In this study, the relationship between the likelihood of tropical cyclogenesis and external environmental forcings is explored in the simplest idealized modelling framework possible: radiative-convective equilibrium on a doubly periodic f-plane. In such an environment, control of the equilibrium environmental sounding is reduced to three parameters: the sea-surface temperature, the Coriolis parameter, and the imposed background surface wind speed. Cloud-resolving mesoscale model simulations are used to generate environments of radiative-convective equilibrium determined by these three factors. The favourability of these environments for tropical cyclogenesis is measured in three ways: in terms of the maximum potential intensity (MPI) of the sounding, based on the thermodynamic theory of Emanuel; in terms of the `genesis potential' determined by an empirical genesis parameter; and in terms of the propensity of weak initial vortices in these environments to form into tropical cyclones. The simulated environments of radiative\textemdash convective equilibrium with no vertical wind shear are found to be very favourable for tropical cyclogenesis. Weak initial vortices always transition to a tropical cyclone, even for rather low sea-surface temperatures. However, the time required for these vortices to make the transition from a weak, mid-level vortex to a rapidly developing tropical cyclone decreases as the MPI increases, indicating the importance of MPI in enhancing the frequency of cyclogenesis. The relationship between this `time to genesis' and the thermodynamic parameters is explored. The time to genesis is found to be very highly (negatively) correlated to MPI, with little or no relationship to convective instability, Coriolis parameter, mid-level humidity, or the empirical genesis parameter. In some cases, tropical cyclones are found to form spontaneously from random convection. This formation is due to a cooperative interaction between large-scale moisture, long-wave radiation, and locally enhanced sea-surface fluxes, similar to the `aggregation' of convection found in previous studies.

In the model the latitudinal distribution of the zonal average surface temperature is represented by a series of Legendre polynomials, while its time-dependence is represented by a Fourier sine-cosine series. The model has three parameters which are adjusted so that the observed amplitudes of the Northern Hemisphere's zonal mean surface temperature are recovered. In order to obtain the correct amplitude and phase of the surface temperature's seasonal oscillation, allowance must be made for the disparity between the thermal inertia of the atmosphere over continents and that of the ocean's mixed layer. Although the model parameters are adjusted to recover the surface temperature fields of the Northern Hemisphere, a test of the model's ability to produce the fields of the Southern Hemisphere indicates that the model responds properly to changes in boundary conditions.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The seasonal model is used to reveal how the annual mean climate and its sensitivity to changes in incident radiation differ from the predictions obtained with the corresponding mean annual model. Although the zonal temperatures obtained with the seasonal model are 1\textendash 3\textdegree C higher than those obtained with the mean annual model, the changes in the global average annual mean surface temperatures calculated with the two models are practically identical for a 1\% decrease in solar constant. Furthermore, because the albedo changes in them are linked mainly to changes in surface temperature, both models respond in the same manner to changes in the incident solar radiation caused by changes in the earth's orbit. The distribution of the incident solar radiation in the models is shown to be insensitive to changes in the eccentricity and the longitude of perihelion and sensitive only to changes in the obliquity of the earth.

The modeled spatial distribution and interannual variability of the sea-ice cover agree well with satellite observations and are improved relative to the model's predecessor ECHAM5/MPIOM. An evaluation of modeled sea-ice coverage based on sea-ice area gives, however, conflicting results compared to an evaluation based on sea-ice extent and is additionally hindered by uncertainties in the observational record. Simulated trends in sea-ice coverage for the satellite period range from more strongly negative than observed to positive. The observed evolution of Arctic sea ice is incompatible with modeled internal variability and probably caused by external forcing. Simulated drift patterns agree well with observations, but simulated drift speed is generally too high. Simulated sea-ice volume agrees well with volume estimates of the PIOMAS reanalysis for the past few years. However, a preceding Arctic wide decrease in sea-ice volume starts much earlier in MPI-ESM than in PIOMAS. Analyzing this behavior in MPI-ESM's ocean model MPIOM, we find that the modeled volume trend depends crucially on the specific choice of atmospheric reanalysis forcing, which casts some doubt on the reliability of estimates of volume trends. In our CMIP5 scenario simulations, we find a substantial delay in sea-ice response to increasing CO2 concentration; a seasonally ice-free Arctic can result for a CO2 concentration of around 500 ppm. Simulated winter sea-ice coverage drops rapidly to near ice-free conditions once the mean Arctic winter temperature exceeds -5\textdegree C.},

  abstract = {Abstract The midwinter suppression of eddy activity in the North Pacific storm track is a phenomenon that has resisted reproduction in idealized models that are initialized independently of the observed atmosphere. Attempts at explaining it have often focused on local mechanisms that depend on zonal asymmetries, such as effects of topography on the mean flow and eddies. Here an idealized aquaplanet GCM is used to demonstrate that a midwinter suppression can also occur in the activity of a statistically zonally symmetric storm track. For a midwinter suppression to occur, it is necessary that parameters, such as the thermal inertia of the upper ocean and the strength of tropical ocean energy transport, are chosen suitably to produce a pronounced seasonal cycle of the subtropical jet characteristics. If the subtropical jet is sufficiently strong and located close to the midlatitude storm track during midwinter, it dominates the upper-level flow and guides eddies equatorward, away from the low-level area of eddy generation. This inhibits the baroclinic interaction between upper and lower levels within the storm track and weakens eddy activity. However, as the subtropical jet continues to move poleward during late winter in the idealized GCM (and unlike what is observed), eddy activity picks up again, showing that the properties of the subtropical jet that give rise to the midwinter suppression are subtle. The idealized GCM simulations provide a framework within which possible mechanisms giving rise to a midwinter suppression of storm tracks can be investigated systematically.},

  abstract = {Abstract A series of numerical experiments is performed using a general circulation model with an idealistic ocean-covered boundary condition. The meridional structure of the Hadley circulation system, which is a combined structure of the Hadley circulation and the tropical precipitation zone, is examined from the standpoints of the water vapor and the energy budgets. Although the prescribed SST distribution has a broad peak centered at the equator, the distribution of the precipitation has two peaks straddling the equator. The distribution of the evaporation rate is revealed to be an important factor in the formation of this structure. The evaporation rate is smaller near the equator than in the subtropics because of its dependence upon the wind speed. If this dependence is removed from the parameterization of the evaporation, the latitudinal distribution of evaporation becomes flat and the precipitation concentrates at the equator to form a single band structure. Qualitatively similar results are obtained in the experiments with axisymmetric two-dimensional model without the effect of disturbances. The net supply of the moist static energy, which is the difference between the supply of energy mainly through evaporation and the loss of energy through radiative cooling, must balance with the divergence of the meridional transport of moist static energy. It is considered to be the quantity controlling the meridional structure of the system. Since the latent energy supply and the radiative loss tend to cancel each other, a small fractional change in the evaporation rate causes a large change in the net energy supply and thus results in a strong modification of the meridional structure of the system. In other words, a strong positive feedback between the strength of the Hadley circulation and the latitudinal concentration of the precipitation provides the high sensitivity of the Hadley circulation system to the distribution of the evaporation, which is the principal energy source of the system. A set of comparative experiments with different cumulus parameterization schemes is performed. It is shown that the difference in the vertical stratification significantly modifies the energy budget of the Hadley circulation system and causes a large difference in the distribution of precipitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Water vapor directly affects the dynamics of atmospheric eddy circulations through the release of latent heat. But it is difficult to include latent heat release in dynamical theories because of the associated nonlinearity (precipitation generally occurs where there is upward motion). A new effective static stability is derived that fundamentally captures the effect of latent heat release on moist eddy circulations. It differs from the usual dry static stability by an additive term that depends on temperature and a parameter measuring the up\textendash down asymmetry of vertical velocity statistics. Latent heat release reduces the effective static stability experienced by eddies but cannot reduce it to zero so long as there are nonprecipitating regions of the eddies. Evaluation based on reanalysis data indicates that the effective static stability in the lower troposphere ranges from {$\sim$}80\% of the dry static stability at high latitudes to {$\sim$}25\% in the tropics. The effective static stability provides a solution to the longstanding problem of how to adapt dry dynamical theories to the moist circulations in the atmosphere. Its utility for climate change problems is illustrated based on simulations with an idealized general circulation model. It is shown to help account for changes in the thermal stratification of the extratropical troposphere, the extent of the Hadley cells, the intensity of extratropical transient eddies, and the extratropical eddy length.},

This paper examines how the eddy kinetic energy in midlatitude baroclinic zones responds to changes in radiative forcing in simulations with an idealized moist general circulation model. In a series of simulations in which the optical thickness of the longwave absorber is varied over a wide range, the eddy kinetic energy has a maximum for a climate with mean temperature similar to that of present-day earth, with significantly smaller values both for warmer and for colder climates. In a series of simulations in which the meridional insolation gradient is varied, the eddy kinetic energy increases monotonically with insolation gradient. In both series of simulations, the eddy kinetic energy scales approximately linearly with the dry mean available potential energy averaged over the baroclinic zones. Changes in eddy kinetic energy can therefore be related to the changes in the atmospheric thermal structure that affect the mean available potential energy.},

The intensity of precipitation extremes is widely held to increase proportionately to the increase in atmospheric water vapor content. Here, we show that this is not the case in 21st-century climate change scenarios simulated with climate models. In the tropics, precipitation extremes are not simulated reliably and do not change consistently among climate models; in the extratropics, they consistently increase more slowly than atmospheric water vapor content. We give a physical basis for how precipitation extremes change with climate and show that their changes depend on changes in the moist-adiabatic temperature lapse rate, in the upward velocity, and in the temperature when precipitation extremes occur. For the tropics, the theory suggests that improving the simulation of upward velocities in climate models is essential for improving predictions of precipitation extremes; for the extratropics, agreement with theory and the consistency among climate models increase confidence in the robustness of predictions of precipitation extremes under climate change.},

Several physical contributions govern the response of precipitation extremes. The thermodynamic contribution is robust and well understood, but theoretical understanding of the microphysical and dynamical contributions is still being developed. Orographic precipitation extremes and snowfall extremes respond differently from other precipitation extremes and require particular attention. Outstanding research challenges include the influence of mesoscale convective organization, the dependence on the duration considered, and the need to better constrain the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes to warming.},

Here, we analyse precipitation extremes in high-resolution simulations that are run without a convective parameterization on a quasi-global aquaplanet. The frequency distributions of precipitation rates and precipitation cluster sizes in the tropics of a control simulation are similar to the observed distributions. In response to climate warming, 3\,h precipitation extremes increase at rates of up to 9\%K-1 9 \% \, K - 1  in the tropics because of a combination of positive thermodynamic and dynamic contributions. The dynamic contribution at different latitudes is connected to the vertical structure of warming using a moist static stability. When the precipitation rates are first averaged to a daily timescale and coarse-grained to a typical global climate-model resolution prior to calculating the precipitation extremes, the response of the precipitation extremes to warming becomes more similar to what was found previously in coarse-resolution aquaplanet studies. However, the simulations studied here do not exhibit the high rates of increase of tropical precipitation extremes found in projections with some global climate models.

I show that the southern storm track intensifies in the multimodel mean of simulations of 21st century climate change, and that the seasonal cycle of storm-track intensity increases in amplitude in both hemispheres. I use observations of the present-day seasonal cycle to confirm the relationship between storm-track intensity and the mean available potential energy of the atmosphere, and show how this quantitative relationship can be used to account for much of the varied response in storm-track intensity to global warming, including substantially different responses in simulations with different climate models. The results suggest that storm-track intensity is not related in a simple way to global-mean surface temperature, so that, for example, a stronger southern storm track in response to present-day global warming does not imply it was also stronger in hothouse climates of the past.},

Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and nonnegativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment.},

Comparison of GEMCLIM simulation with observations for current climate (1981\textendash 2010) suggests that GEMCLIM realistically reproduces the spatial and seasonal variation of Arctic cyclone frequency and intensity, and associated precipitation, for winter and summer. Clear added-value is found for several regions, compared to the driving data. The pressure-wind speed relationships for each region are reasonably reproduced and more extreme winds associated with increasing cyclone intensity are realistically simulated. In addition, the spatial and temporal variations of observed extreme cyclones are well captured. In future climate (2070\textendash 2099), the winter cyclone intensity and frequency, and associated precipitation, are projected to increase and decrease over the Aleutian and Icelandic Low regions, respectively. For summer, the projected changes are relatively smaller than those for winter and vary with region. Interestingly, significant decreases in cyclone contribution to total precipitation are found for northern Canada and Eurasia regions, despite increases in cyclone-related precipitation amount. This suggests stronger influence of mesoscale systems on precipitation compared to synoptic-scale systems. Enhanced pressure-wind speed relationships are projected for Arctic Canada and the Chukchi and East Siberian Seas. The increase of extreme cyclones during autumn is primarily related to sea ice loss during summer, while for winter, large-scale circulation changes (i.e. Arctic dipole) are mostly responsible due to strong sea ice loss in the central Arctic during autumn. This study demonstrates the added-value of dynamic downscaling with respect to Arctic cyclone characteristics and associated surface variables and provides useful insights regarding their future projections for use in risk assessment studies.},

We performed radiative-convective equilibrium simulations for configurations with a wide range of vertical resolutions using a global nonhydrostatic model including explicit cloud microphysics. It was found that the high-cloud cover almost monotonically decreased as the vertical resolution increased. We also found that the high-cloud cover increased (decreased) as the sea surface temperature increased for higher (lower) vertical resolutions. Budget analyses of ice water condensate in transition states to equilibria were performed using the binned vertical profile method and revealed that the tendencies due to the turbulent mixing near convective cores were strongly dependent on the vertical resolution. Analyses of turbulent diffusivity profiles showed that the diffusivity tended to decrease as the vertical resolution increased. The vertical resolution dependency of turbulent mixing was related to frequently occurring weak stratification near the convective cores. We verified these findings via sensitivity experiments and determined that the contribution of the vertical resolution dependency of other processes was secondary. As substantial variability in vertical diffusivity has been reported in both models and observations, these results suggest that a more thorough understanding of turbulent mixing is needed to comprehend high-cloud changes in warming climates better.},

Previous studies have focused on the role of large-scale circulations in high cloud change, and little attention is paid to the local processes in high clouds. Here, we show that the evolution of ice clouds in the upper troposphere due to the cloud microphysical processes is dominated by the collection, sublimation, deposition, and sedimentation using a model with an explicit cloud microphysics scheme. Furthermore, we show that these processes can be enhanced and can lead to the reduction of high clouds in warmer climates through the pressure dependencies of fall speeds of ice particles and the molecular diffusivity of water vapor. Our results highlight the importance of change of the high cloud pressure level in the high cloud area feedback.},

  abstract = {The high-cloud amount responses to sea surface temperature (SST) changes were investigated based on simulations with radiative-convective equilibrium configuration using a high-resolution nonhydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model. The radiative-convective equilibrium was calculated using a nonrotating sphere with Earth radius and a 14-km horizontal mesh with uniform SSTs of 300 and 304 K. Two types of cloud microphysics schemes (single- and double-moment bulk schemes) and two types of vertical layer configurations (38 and 78 layers) were tested. The radiatively driven circulation weakens with increasing SST in all simulation pairs due to the increase in the static stability, as suggested in previous studies. In contrast, the high-cloud amount increases in three simulation pairs and decreases in one pair. These indicate that the weakening of radiatively driven circulation with increasing SST does not always accompany the high-cloud amount decrease. We determined that the tropopause layer was wet (dry) in simulations that showed positive (negative) high-cloud cover responses. The radiatively driven upward moisture transport just below the wet tropopause layer increases with increasing SST in the simulation pairs with positive high-cloud amount responses, and this causes the supply of ice condensate to the lower layer through the sedimentation process, while this feedback was not observed in the simulation pair with the negative response. These indicate that the high-cloud cover response depends on the occurrence of the feedback and there is a feedback threshold among the variety of simulations. And furthermore, these speculate that whether the feedback mechanism is effective or not has the large impact on high-cloud responses in the real atmosphere.},

Sea ice concentration and ice type are incorporated by using an SSM/I open water and thin-ice algorithm to better represent the sea ice conditions. The mean seasonal variation of the net heat flux, averaged over the entire Okhotsk Sea, ranges from a summer maximum of 158 W m-2 in June (a positive value indicates that the sea or sea ice gains heat form the air), to a winter minimum of -219 W m-2 in December. The seasonal geographic distribution of the net heat flux is determined mostly by turbulent (sensible and latent) heat flux. Because of the heat insulating effect of sea ice, the turbulent heat flux and accordingly the net heat flux has the largest variation in winter, particularly in the north region, reflecting the yearly difference of sea ice extent. The geographic distribution of the annual net heat flux shows a distinct contrast, significant cooling of the ocean in the north and net heating of the ocean in the south. This contrast is a result of heat transport by both sea ice and the southward East Sakhalin Current; sea ice formed by obtaining negative latent heat in the north is transported to the south, then it releases the negative latent heat by melting. The annual net heat budget is estimated to be -22 W m-2 averaged over the entire sea. The Okhotsk Sea loses heat to the atmosphere on an annual basis, although at least the order of 20 W m-2 error exists in the estimation. A trial was performed to estimate sea ice production using the heat budget calculation. The results suggest that most of the production occurs in open water and thin ice areas. The highest production area is located over the northwest shelf, within 100 km of the coast.},

These transient eddies act to maintain the midlatitude jet streams by systematically transporting westerly momentum and heat. Yet, little is known about the separate contributions of cyclones and anticyclones to their interaction with the westerlies. Here, using a novel methodology for identifying cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices based on curvature, we quantify their separate contributions to atmospheric energetics and their feedback on the westerly jet streams as represented in Eulerian statistics. We show that climatological westerly acceleration by cyclonic vortices acts to dominantly reinforce the wintertime eddy-driven near-surface westerlies and associated cyclonic shear. Though less baroclinic and energetic, anticyclones still play an important role in transporting westerly momentum toward midlatitudes from the upper-tropospheric thermally driven jet core and carrying eddy energy downstream. These new findings have uncovered essential characteristics of atmospheric energetics, storm track dynamics and eddy-mean flow interaction.},

We use the ROCKE-3D ocean-atmosphere general circulation model to investigate the response of Earth's present-day and Archean climate system to low versus high ocean salinity. We find that saltier oceans yield warmer climates in large part due to changes in ocean dynamics. Increasing ocean salinity from 20 to 50 g/kg results in a 71\% reduction in sea ice cover in our present-day Earth scenario. This same salinity change also halves the pCO2 threshold at which Snowball glaciation occurs in our Archean scenarios. In combination with higher levels of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4, a saltier ocean may allow for a warm Archean Earth with only seasonal ice at the poles despite receiving {$\sim$}20\% less energy from the Sun.},

The Scenario Model Intercomparison Project (ScenarioMIP) is the primary activity within Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) that will provide multi-model climate projections based on alternative scenarios of future emissions and land use changes produced with integrated assessment models. In this paper, we describe ScenarioMIP's objectives, experimental design, and its relation to other activities within CMIP6. The ScenarioMIP design is one component of a larger scenario process that aims to facilitate a wide range of integrated studies across the climate science, integrated assessment modeling, and impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability communities, and will form an important part of the evidence base in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. At the same time, it will provide the basis for investigating a number of targeted science and policy questions that are especially relevant to scenario-based analysis, including the role of specific forcings such as land use and aerosols, the effect of a peak and decline in forcing, the consequences of scenarios that limit warming to below 2 \textdegree C, the relative contributions to uncertainty from scenarios, climate models, and internal variability, and long-term climate system outcomes beyond the 21st century. To serve this wide range of scientific communities and address these questions, a design has been identified consisting of eight alternative 21st century scenarios plus one large initial condition ensemble and a set of long-term extensions, divided into two tiers defined by relative priority. Some of these scenarios will also provide a basis for variants planned to be run in other CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs to investigate questions related to specific forcings. Harmonized, spatially explicit emissions and land use scenarios generated with integrated assessment models will be provided to participating climate modeling groups by late 2016, with the climate model simulations run within the 2017\textendash 2018 time frame, and output from the climate model projections made available and analyses performed over the 2018\textendash 2020 period.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {In order to understand better the processes responsible for maintaining the arctic climate, a study has been made of the energy budget at high latitudes. For simplicity this study is restricted to budget calculations for a polar cap that contains almost the entire atmospheric mass north of latitude 60\textdegree N. The computations are based on 5 years of daily upper air observations of wind, temperature, geopotential height, and specific humidity for the period May 1958\textendash April 1963, contained in the so-called MIT general circulation library. From the hemispheric network of radiosonde stations available in the library, more than 200 stations are located north of 50\textdegree N. All these stations were used in the analyses to define the meteorological parameters in the Arctic. Averaged over the year, about 75\% of the energy needed to balance radiative cooling in the polar cap is found to be transported by atmospheric processes across the southern boundary. The remaining 25\% is probably supplied through a direct exchange of sensible and latent heat at the earth's surface in the polar cap. Throughout the year the influx of sensible heat plus potential energy dominates over that of latent heat. A further breakdown according to the mechanism of transfer shows that at 60\textdegree N transient and stationary disturbances are far more effective than the mean meridional circulation in transporting energy poleward. By using Budyko's values for the surface energy flux, indirect estimates could be made of the radiative heat loss in the polar cap that are in good agreement with earlier direct estimates. The computed cooling curve has an interesting asymmetry; it shows a rapid decrease of cooling from about -1.4\textdegree C/day in winter to about -0.6\textdegree C/day in May, followed by a slow increase throughout the summer and fall. The year-to-year variability in inflow of energy from middle latitudes seems to be large, especially during the winter half year. Since observed temperature deviations in the polar cap appear to be, on the average, a factor of 5 smaller than the variations in inflow, these deviations must be largely compensated by variations in radiative cooling or in heat supply from the earth's surface. The present evidence tends to underline the complexity of the mechanism responsible for climatic anomalies in the Arctic.},

OMIP aims to provide standard protocols and diagnostics for ocean models, while offering a forum to promote their common assessment and improvement. It also offers to compare solutions of the same ocean models when forced with reanalysis data (OMIP simulations) vs. when integrated within fully coupled Earth system models (CMIP6). Here we detail simulation protocols and diagnostics for OMIP's biogeochemical and inert chemical tracers. These passive-tracer simulations will be coupled to ocean circulation models, initialized with observational data or output from a model spin-up, and forced by repeating the 1948\textendash 2009 surface fluxes of heat, fresh water, and momentum. These so-called OMIP-BGC simulations include three inert chemical tracers (CFC-11, CFC-12, SF\textsubscript{6}) and biogeochemical tracers (e.g., dissolved inorganic carbon, carbon isotopes, alkalinity, nutrients, and oxygen). Modelers will use their preferred prognostic BGC model but should follow common guidelines for gas exchange and carbonate chemistry. Simulations include both natural and total carbon tracers. The required forced simulation (\emph{omip1}) will be initialized with gridded observational climatologies. An optional forced simulation (\emph{omip1-spunup}) will be initialized instead with BGC fields from a long model spin-up, preferably for 2000 years or more, and forced by repeating the same 62-year meteorological forcing. That optional run will also include abiotic tracers of total dissolved inorganic carbon and radiocarbon, \emph{C}\textsubscript{T}\textsuperscript{abio} and \textsuperscript{14}\emph{C}\textsubscript{T}\textsuperscript{abio}, to assess deep-ocean ventilation and distinguish the role of physics vs. biology. These simulations will be forced by observed atmospheric histories of the three inert gases and CO\textsubscript{2} as well as carbon isotope ratios of CO\textsubscript{2}. OMIP-BGC simulation protocols are founded on those from previous phases of the Ocean Carbon-Cycle Model Intercomparison Project.

The net precipitation depends strongly on the poleward transient moisture flux into the region, which is affected by both the meridional moisture gradient and eddy activity. Thus, the seasonal variation of the poleward transient moisture flux is determined by the relative amplitude of the moisture and eddy factors, that is, by the ratio of the amplitude of the seasonal variation to the annual mean.

  abstract = {Atmospheric hydrological cycles over the Arctic and Antarctic have been investigated in the previous studies and there are some similarity and dissimilarity in the two polar regions. The Arctic and Antarctic are areas of moisture flux convergence through the year. So the precipitation (P) exceeds the evaporation (E) and the net precipitation (P-E) is positive. Therefore, the atmospheric moisture transport is a primary input of water into the polar regions. Meanwhile the climatological seasonal cycles of P-E over these regions are dominated by transient moisture flux associated with cyclone activities, the  interannual variations are governed by the stationary flux associated with the Arctic Oscillation and the  Antarctic Oscillation (AAO). In addition, recent climate changes influence the polar hydrological cycles. Our analyses using an atmospheric reanalysis up to recent years indicated that there were no significant long-term changes in the poleward moisture transport into both the Arctic and Antarctic during 1979-2016. On the other hand, the water vapor (precipitable water) were clearly increasing over the Arctic and gradually decreasing over the Antarctic during the same period. As expected, the increasing trend of water vapor was due to the large warming over the Arctic. There were two reasons for the gradually decreasing trend of water vapor over the Antarctic. The first one was the positive trend of AAO in summer and the second was deepening trend of the Amundsen low in autumn. The trends in water vapor and temperature during the past 38 years further suggest that  both polar regions were getting dryer in several seasons. The trend, however, needs to be confirmed by follow-up climatological analyses.},

For January, the Arctic-wide averaged temperature anomaly was 2.0\textdegree C above the previous record of 3.0\textdegree C based on four reanalysis products. Midlatitude atmospheric circulation played a major role in producing such extreme temperatures. Extensive low geopotential heights at 700 hPa extended over the southeastern United States, across the Atlantic, and well into the Arctic. Low geopotential heights along the Aleutian Islands and a ridge along northwestern North America contributed southerly wind flow. These two regions of low geopotential height were seen as a major split in the tropospheric polar vortex over the Arctic. Warm air advection north of central Eurasia reinforced the ridge that split the flow near the North Pole. Winter 2015 and 2016 geopotential height fields represented an eastward shift in the longwave atmospheric circulation pattern compared to earlier in the decade (2010\textendash 13). Certainly Arctic amplification will continue, and 2016 shows that there can be major Arctic contributions from midlatitudes. Whether Arctic amplification feedbacks are accelerated by the combination of recent thinner, more mobile Arctic sea ice and occasional extreme atmospheric circulation events from midlatitudes is an interesting conjecture.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {This article provides a synthesis of the latest observational trends and projections for the future of the Arctic. First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75\% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2~\textdegree C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4~\textdegree C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions.},

  abstract = {Arctic cooling through the fall-winter transition is calculated from a coupled atmosphere-sea ice thermal model and compared to temperature soundings and surface measurements made north of Svalbard during the Coordinated Eastern Arctic Experiment (CEAREX). A typical winter, clear-sky vertical temperature structure of the polar air mass is composed of a surface-based temperature inversion or an inversion above a very shallow (30\textendash 180 m) mechanically mixed boundary layer with temperatures -30\textdegree{} to -35\textdegree C, a broad temperature maximum layer of -20\textdegree{} to -25\textdegree C between 0.5 and 2 km, and a negative lapse rate aloft. Because the emissivity of the temperature maximum layer is less than that of the snow surface, radiative equilibrium maintains this low level temperature inversion structure. A 90-day simulation shows that heat flux through the ice is insufficient to maintain a local thermal equilibrium. Northward temperature advection by transient storms is required to balance outward longwave radiation to space. Leads and thin ice ({$<$}0.8 m) contribute 12\% to the winter tropospheric heat balance in the central Arctic. CEAREX temperature soundings and longwave radiation data taken near 81\textdegree N show polar air mass characteristics by early November, but numerous storms interrupted this air mass during December. Snow temperature changes of 15\textdegree C occurred in response to changes in downward atmospheric longwave radiation of 90 W m-2 between cloud and clear sky. We propose that the strength of boundary layer stability, and thus the degree of air-ice momentum coupling, is driven by the magnitude of the radiation deficit (downward-outward longwave) at the surface and the potential temperature of the temperature maximum layer. This concept is of potential benefit in prescribing atmospheric forcing for sea ice models because a surface air temperature-snow temperature difference field is difficult to obtain and it may be possible to obtain a radiation deficit field via satellite sensors.},

There is a decrease in the number of cyclones with latitude in all months and division into two storm tracks, one propagating north-northeast along the Siberian peninsula and one entering the southern Bering Sea on a northeasterly course and either curving northward into the central Bering Sea or continuing parallel to the Aleutian Island chain.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Monthly average ice extents are established for February and March 1958\textendash 80 along a line from Norton Sound southwest toward the ice edge, perpendicular to the average maximum extent. Comparison of composite cyclone charts summed over the winter season and over the five heaviest and five lightest ice years shows a shift in cyclone centers toward the west in light ice years. The correlation between maximum seasonal ice extent and the difference between the number of cyclone centers in the eastern minus the western part of the basin over each winter season is 0.71. The relation of sea ice extent and the location of cyclone tracks is consistent with previous observations that advance of the ice edge in the Bering Sea is dominated by wind-driven advection and that southerly winds associated with cyclone tracks to the west inhibit this advance. These results indicate that the interannual variability in seasonal sea-ice extent in the Bering Sea is controlled by an externally determined variation in storm-track position related to large-scale differences in the general circulation. A skewed distribution of ice extents toward heavy ice years, however, suggests the possibility of an oceanographic constraint on the magnitude of extreme seasonal ice extents, such as the inability of melting ice to cool the mixed layer beyond the continental shelf to the freezing point or the increased influence of the northwestward flowing, continental slope current.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

During the five month winter period (NDJFM) the transport of sensible heat by transient eddies is the largest component (50\%) at 70\textdegree N, followed by the transport of sensible but by standing eddies (25\%), and the moist static energy flux by the mean meridional circulation (25\%). The mean meridional circulation (MMC) changes from a Ferrel cell to a thermally direct circulation near 60\textdegree N; maximum horizontal velocities in the thermally direct circulation peak new 70\textdegree N. North of 60\textdegree N the sensible heat flux by the MMC is southward and opposes the greater northward transport of geopotential energy. The transport of energy is not uniform. Major pathways are the northward transport of positive anomalies through the Greenland and Barents Seas into the eastern Arctic and the southward transport of negative anomalies to the cast of the Siberian high. The Atlantic pathway in winter relates to transport by transient eddies, while the western Siberian flux relates to the standing eddy pattern. Interannual variability of northward MSE is concentrated in these two regions. The western Arctic Ocean from about 30\textdegree{} to 60\textdegree W receives about 50 W m\textsuperscript{-2} less energy flux convergence than the eastern Arctic. This result compares well with the observed minimum January surface air temperatures in the Canadian Basin of the western Arctic and implies that the greater observed ice thickness in this region may have a thermodynamic as well as a dynamic origin.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the location and magnitude of ocean heat content (OHC) variability and change is essential for understanding the processes that govern decadal variations in surface temperature, quantifying changes in the planetary energy budget, and developing constraints on the transient climate response to external forcings. We present an overview of the temporal and spatial characteristics of OHC variability and change as represented by an ensemble of dynamical and statistical ocean reanalyses (ORAs). Spatial maps of the 0\textendash 300~m layer show large regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans where the interannual variability of the ensemble mean exceeds ensemble spread, indicating that OHC variations are well-constrained by the available observations over the period 1993\textendash 2009. At deeper levels, the ORAs are less well-constrained by observations with the largest differences across the ensemble mostly associated with areas of high eddy kinetic energy, such as the Southern Ocean and boundary current regions. Spatial patterns of OHC change for the period 1997\textendash 2009 show good agreement in the upper 300~m and are characterized by a strong dipole pattern in the Pacific Ocean. There is less agreement in the patterns of change at deeper levels, potentially linked to differences in the representation of ocean dynamics, such as water mass formation processes. However, the Atlantic and Southern Oceans are regions in which many ORAs show widespread warming below 700~m over the period 1997\textendash 2009. Annual time series of global and hemispheric OHC change for 0\textendash 700~m show the largest spread for the data sparse Southern Hemisphere and a number of ORAs seem to be subject to large initialization `shock' over the first few years. In agreement with previous studies, a number of ORAs exhibit enhanced ocean heat uptake below 300 and 700~m during the mid-1990s or early 2000s. The ORA ensemble mean ({$\pm$}1 standard deviation) of rolling 5-year trends in full-depth OHC shows a relatively steady heat uptake of approximately 0.9~{$\pm~$}0.8~W~m-2 (expressed relative to Earth's surface area) between 1995 and 2002, which reduces to about 0.2~{$\pm~$}0.6~W~m-2 between 2004 and 2006, in qualitative agreement with recent analysis of Earth's energy imbalance. There is a marked reduction in the ensemble spread of OHC trends below 300~m as the Argo profiling float observations become available in the early 2000s. In general, we suggest that ORAs should be treated with caution when employed to understand past ocean warming trends\textemdash especially when considering the deeper ocean where there is little in the way of observational constraints. The current work emphasizes the need to better observe the deep ocean, both for providing observational constraints for future ocean state estimation efforts and also to develop improved models and data assimilation methods.},

A total of 95 profiles, up to the height of 2 km, were measured on 39 days. Inversions were present in 88\% of the data, 13\% of them being surface-based. Compared to winter, the occurrence and properties of summer inversions depended much less on surface net radiation and were mainly controlled by the surface melt and warm-air advection. Inversions occurring during snow/ice melt were located at low altitudes, frequently based at the surface, and were often as strong as winter inversions reported in previous studies. In general, the Tara inversions were shallow, and the deepest ones were observed when clouds occurred inside or partly above the inversion layer. Inversions were strongest under clear skies or in cases when the cloud top was above the inversion base. Related to cases of strong warm-air advection (up to 35 K day-1) in July, exceptionally high temperatures around the inversion top caused maximum inversion strengths up to 13 K. Inversions of this magnitude at this time of year have been rarely documented previously.},

We examined this discrepancy by using a regional climate model and found a circulation-precipitation coupling under enhanced greenhouse gas concentrations that occurs on scales too small for current GCMs to resolve well. Results show a local minimum of warming in the central U.S. (a ``warming hole'') associated with changes in low-level circulations that lead to replenishment of seasonally depleted soil moisture, thereby increasing late-summer evapotranspiration and suppressing daytime maximum temperatures. These regional-scale feedback processes may partly explain the observed late 20th century temperature trend in the central U.S. and potentially could reduce the magnitude of future greenhouse warming in the region.},

The three sets of driving boundary conditions are a reanalysis, an atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation model (GCM) current climate, and a future scenario of transient climate change. Common precipitation climatology features simulated by both models included realistic orographic precipitation, east-west transcontinental gradients, and reasonable annual cycles over different geographic locations. However, both models missed heavy cool-season precipitation in the lower Mississippi River basin, a seemingly common model defect. Various simulation biases (differences) produced by the RCMs are evaluated based on the 2\texttimes 3 experiment set in addition to comparisons with the GCM simulation. The RCM performance bias is smallest, whereas the GCM-RCM downscaling bias (difference between GCM and RCM) is largest. The boundary forcing bias (difference between GCM current climate driven run and reanalysis-driven run) and intermodel bias are both largest in summer, possibly due to different subgrid scale processes in individual models. The ratio of climate change to biases, which we use as one measure of confidence in projected climate changes, is substantially larger than 1 in several seasons and regions while the ratios are always less than 1 in summer. The largest ratios among all regions are in California. Spatial correlation coefficients of precipitation were computed between simulation pairs in the 2\texttimes 3 set. The climate change correlation is highest and the RCM performance correlation is lowest while boundary forcing and intermodel correlations are intermediate. The high spatial correlation for climate change suggests that even though future precipitation is projected to increase, its overall continental-scale spatial pattern is expected to remain relatively constant. The low RCM performance correlation shows a modeling challenge to reproduce observed spatial precipitation patterns.},

  abstract = {Cloud top and tropopause relationships are examined using cloud top observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) cloud data and National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (GFS) tropopause data. Statistical analyses of cloud top occurrence in tropopause and jet referenced relative altitude coordinates are performed on a global scale using 4 years (2006\textendash 2010) of CALIPSO 5 km resolution cloud layer data. The results show that the thermal tropopause appears to be a significant constraint for the cloud top. The zonal vertical distribution of cloud tops in tropopause-relative coordinates shows a maximum at the tropopause level for both the tropics (20\textdegree S\textendash 20\textdegree N) and midlatitudes (40\textdegree\textendash 60\textdegree S, 40\textdegree\textendash 60\textdegree N) for all four seasons. Occurrence of cloud tops above the tropopause is examined and quantified. The results show that with the consideration of tropopause height uncertainty, the data do not provide sufficient evidence of significant presence of cloud tops above the tropopause in the midlatitudes. In the tropics, the significant occurrences of cloud top above the thermal tropopause are found in regions known for seasonal deep convection. In most cases, the occurrence is up to 24\% in 2\textdegree{} \texttimes{} 3\textdegree{} latitude-longitude bins with isolated higher frequencies in the western Pacific during the northern hemispheric winter season. The vertical distributions show that these events are mostly up to 2.5 km above the lapse rate tropopause, which is comparable to the differences between the lapse rate and the cold point tropopause in regions of active convection. We speculate that this separation may be responsible for a significant fraction of the cloud tops that do occur above the lapse rate tropopause in our analyses. It is also important to note that our results are limited by the CALIPSO twice-daily sampling with local equator crossing times of 0130 and 1330. The data therefore do not provide a good representation of convection over land, which is known to have maxima in afternoon local times. The tropopause determination is a significant component of this type of studies, and errors in the tropopause height may lead to significantly different conclusions. Our analyses show that the tropopause product from the GFS model is in better agreement with radiosonde measurements. The Goddard Earth Observing System Model Version 5 tropopause product, given as the ancillary data in the CALIPSO data file, shows a much larger uncertainty, primarily because the tropopause is identified at the model grid levels.},

The model dynamics is akin to that of traffic flow, wherein blocking manifests as traffic jams when the streamwise flux of local wave activity reaches capacity. Stationary waves modulate the jet stream's capacity to transmit transient waves and thereby localize block formation. Since the model is inexpensive to run numerically, it is suited for computing blocking statistics as a function of climate variables from large-ensemble, parameter sweep experiments. We explore sensitivity of blocking statistics to (i) stationary wave amplitude, (ii) background jet speed, and (iii) transient eddy forcing, using frequency, persistence, and prevalence as metrics. For each combination of parameters we perform 240 runs of 180-day simulations with aperiodic transient eddy forcing, each time randomizing the phase relations in forcing. The model climate shifts rapidly from a block-free state to a block-dominant state as the stationary wave amplitude is increased and/or the jet speed is decreased. When eddy forcing is increased, prevalence increases similarly but frequency decreases as blocks merge and become more persistent. It is argued that the present-day climate lies close to the boundary of the two states and hence its blocking statistics are sensitive to climate perturbations. The result underscores the low confidence in GCM-based assessment of the future trend of blocking under a changing climate, while it also provides a theoretical basis for evaluating model biases and understanding trends in reanalysis data.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This sea ice decline is attributable to various Arctic environmental changes, such as enhanced downward infrared (IR) radiation, preseason sea ice reduction, enhanced inflow of warm Atlantic water into the Arctic Ocean, and sea ice export. However, their relative contributions are uncertain. Utilizing ERA-Interim and satellite-based data, it is shown here that a positive trend of downward IR radiation accounts for nearly half of the sea ice concentration (SIC) decline during the 1979\textendash 2011 winter over the Atlantic sector. Furthermore, the study shows that the Arctic downward IR radiation increase is driven by horizontal atmospheric water flux and warm air advection into the Arctic, not by evaporation from the Arctic Ocean.

In addition to this trend, substantial interannual variability is present, as is highlighted by the recovery in sea ice area in 2013 following the record minimum in 2012. This interannual variability of the Arctic summer sea ice area has been attributed to the springtime weather disturbances. Here, by utilizing reanalysis- and satellite-based sea ice data, this study shows that summers with unusually small sea ice area are preceded by winters with anomalously strong downward longwave radiation over the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean. This anomalous wintertime radiative forcing at the surface is up to 10\textendash 15 W m\textsuperscript{-2}, which is about twice as strong than that during the spring. During the same winters, the poleward moisture and warm-air intrusions into the Eurasian sector of the Arctic Ocean are anomalously strong and the resulting moisture convergence field closely resembles positive anomalies in column-integrated water vapor and tropospheric temperature.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Climate model simulations support the above-mentioned findings and further show that the anomalously strong wintertime radiative forcing can decrease sea ice thickness over wide areas of the Arctic Ocean, especially over the Eurasian sector. During the winters preceding the anomalously small summer sea ice area, the upper ocean of the model is anomalously warm over the Barents Sea, indicating that the upper-ocean heat content contributes to winter sea ice thinning. Finally, mass divergence by ice drift in the preceding winter and spring contributes to the thinning of sea ice over the East Siberian and Chukchi Seas, where radiative forcing and upper-ocean heat content anomalies are relatively weak.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This is followed by a decline of up to 10\% in sea ice concentration over the Greenland, Barents, and Kara Seas.

Further analysis indicates that strong downward IR events are preceded several days earlier by enhanced convection over the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans.

Two distinct processes contribute to the observed warming signal: (i) local warming in direct response to the GHG forcing and (ii) the effect of enhanced poleward heat transport from low latitudes. A series of aquaplanet experiments, which excludes the surface albedo feedback, is conducted to quantify the relative contributions of these two physical processes to the polar warming magnitude and degree of amplification relative to the global mean. The globe is divided into zonal bands with equal area in eight experiments. For each of these, an external heating is prescribed beneath the slab ocean layer in the respective forcing bands. The summation of the individual temperature responses to each local heating in these experiments is very similar to the response to a globally uniform heating. This allows the authors to decompose the polar warming and amplification signal into the effects of local and remote heating. Local polar heating that induces surface-trapped warming due to the large tropospheric static stability in this region accounts for about half of the polar surface warming. Cloud radiative effects act to enhance this local contribution. In contrast, remote nonpolar heating induces a robust polar warming pattern that features a midtropospheric peak, regardless of the meridional location of the forcing. Among all remote forcing experiments, the deep tropical forcing case contributes most to the polar-amplified surface warming pattern relative to the global mean, while the high-latitude forcing cases contribute most to enhancing the polar surface warming magnitude.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

More specifically, satellite passive-microwave data for the period November 1978\textendash December 2010 reveal an overall positive trend in ice extents of 17 100 \&plusmn; 2300 km\textsuperscript{2} yr\textsuperscript{-1}. Much of the increase, at 13 700 \&plusmn; 1500 km\textsuperscript{2} yr\textsuperscript{-1}, has occurred in the region of the Ross Sea, with lesser contributions from the Weddell Sea and Indian Ocean. One region, that of the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, has (like the Arctic) instead experienced significant sea ice decreases, with an overall ice extent trend of -8200 \&plusmn; 1200 km\textsuperscript{2} yr\textsuperscript{-1}. When examined through the annual cycle over the 32-yr period 1979\textendash 2010, the Southern Hemisphere sea ice cover as a whole experienced positive ice extent trends in every month, ranging in magnitude from a low of 9100 \&plusmn; 6300 km\textsuperscript{2} yr\textsuperscript{-1} in February to a high of 24 700 \&plusmn; 10 000 km\textsuperscript{2} yr\textsuperscript{-1} in May. The Ross Sea and Indian Ocean also had positive trends in each month, while the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas had negative trends in each month, and the Weddell Sea and western Pacific Ocean had a mixture of positive and negative trends. Comparing ice-area results to ice-extent results, in each case the ice-area trend has the same sign as the ice-extent trend, but the magnitudes of the two trends differ, and in some cases these differences allow inferences about the corresponding changes in sea ice concentrations. The strong pattern of decreasing ice coverage in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas region and increasing ice coverage in the Ross Sea region is suggestive of changes in atmospheric circulation. This is a key topic for future research.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Previous idealized modeling studies showed that eddy heat flux response is more sensitive to the variability of lower tropospheric temperature gradient. However, observational evidence is lacking. In this study, observational data analyses are performed to examine the relationships between eddy heat fluxes and temperature gradients during boreal winter by constructing daily indices. On the intraseasonal time scale, the surface temperature gradient is found to be more effective at regulating the synoptic-scale eddy heat flux (SF) than is the upper tropospheric temperature gradient. Enhancements in surface temperature gradient, however, are subject to an inactive planetary-scale eddy heat flux (PF). The PF in turn is dependent on the zonal gradient in tropical convective heating. Consistent with these interactions, over the past 40 winters, the zonal gradient in tropical heating and PF have been trending upward, while the surface temperature gradient and SF have been trending downward. These results indicate that for a better understanding of eddy heat fluxes, attention should be given to zonal convective heating gradients in the tropics as much as to meridional temperature gradients.},

Often these people work in different institutions and may be working with significant separation in time (particularly analysts, who may be working on data produced years earlier), and they typically communicate via published information (whether journal papers, technical notes, or websites). The complexity of the models, experiments, and methodologies, along with the diversity (and sometimes inexact nature) of information sources, can easily lead to misinterpretation of what was actually intended or done. In this paper we introduce a taxonomy of terms for more clearly defining numerical experiments, put it in the context of previous work on experimental ontologies, and describe how we have used it to document the experiments of the sixth phase for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). We describe how, through iteration with a range of CMIP6 stakeholders, we rationalized multiple sources of information and improved the clarity of experimental definitions. We demonstrate how this process has added value to CMIP6 itself by (a) helping those devising experiments to be clear about their goals and their implementation, (b) making it easier for those executing experiments to know what is intended, (c) exposing interrelationships between experiments, and (d) making it clearer for third parties (data users) to understand the CMIP6 experiments.

A global general circulation ocean model is used to study the transient evolution of a heat anomaly that develops following the strong mixing induced by the passage of a tropical cyclone. The results suggest that at least one-third of the anomaly remains in the tropical region for more than one year.

  abstract = {Abstract The entropy budget of an atmosphere in radiative\textendash convective equilibrium is analyzed here. The differential heating of the atmosphere, resulting from surface heat fluxes and tropospheric radiative cooling, corresponds to a net entropy sink. In statistical equilibrium, this entropy sink is balanced by the entropy production due to various irreversible processes such as frictional dissipation, diffusion of heat, diffusion of water vapor, and irreversible phase changes. Determining the relative contribution of each individual irreversible process to the entropy budget can provide important information on the behavior of convection. The entropy budget of numerical simulations with a cloud ensemble model is discussed. In these simulations, it is found that the dominant irreversible entropy source is associated with irreversible phase changes and diffusion of water vapor. In addition, a large fraction of the frictional dissipation results from falling precipitation, and turbulent dissipation accounts for only a small fraction of the entropy production. This behavior is directly related to the fact that the convective heat transport is mostly due to the latent heat transport. In such cases, moist convection acts more as an atmospheric dehumidifier than as a heat engine. The amount of work available to accelerate convective updrafts and downdrafts is much smaller than predicted by studies that assume that moist convection behaves mostly as a perfect heat engine.},

  abstract = {Abstract In moist convection, atmospheric motions transport water vapor from the earth's surface to the regions where condensation occurs. This transport is associated with three other aspects of convection: the latent heat transport, the expansion work performed by water vapor, and the irreversible entropy production due to diffusion of water vapor and phase changes. An analysis of the thermodynamic transformations of atmospheric water yields what is referred to as the entropy budget of the water substance, providing a quantitative relationship between these three aspects of moist convection. The water vapor transport can be viewed as an imperfect heat engine that produces less mechanical work than the corresponding Carnot cycle because of diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes. The entropy budget of the water substance provides an alternative method of determining the irreversible entropy production due to phase changes and diffusion of water vapor. This method has the advantage that it does not require explicit knowledge of the relative humidity or of the molecular flux of water vapor for the estimation of the entropy production. Scaling arguments show that the expansion work of water vapor accounts for a small fraction of the work that would be produced in the absence of irreversible moist processes. It is also shown that diffusion of water vapor and irreversible phase changes can be interpreted as the irreversible counterpart to the continuous dehumidification resulting from condensation and precipitation. This leads to a description of moist convection where it acts more as an atmospheric dehumidifier than as a heat engine.},

Because of the turbulent nature of the flow, any description of a ``mean circulation'' or ``mean parcel trajectories'' is tied to the specific averaging method and coordinate system. In this paper, the NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis data spanning 1970\textendash 2004 are used to compare the mean circulation obtained by averaging the flow on surfaces of constant liquid water potential temperature, or dry isentropes, and on surfaces of constant equivalent potential temperature, or moist isentropes. While the two circulations are qualitatively similar, they differ in intensity. In the tropics, the total mass transport on dry isentropes is larger than the circulation on moist isentropes. In contrast, in midlatitudes, the total mass transport on moist isentropes is between 1.5 and 3 times larger than the mass transport on dry isentropes.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}It is shown here that the differences between the two circulations can be explained by the atmospheric transport of water vapor. In particular, the enhanced mass transport on moist isentropes corresponds to a poleward flow of warm moist air near the earth's surface in midlatitudes. This low-level poleward flow does not appear in the zonally averaged circulation on dry isentropes, as it is hidden by the presence of a larger equatorward flow of drier air at same potential temperature. However, as the equivalent potential temperature in this low-level poleward flow is close to the potential temperature of the air near the tropopause, it is included in the total circulation on moist isentropes. In the tropics, the situation is reversed: the Hadley circulation transports warm moist air toward the equator, and in the opposite direction to the flow at upper levels, and the circulation on dry isentropes is larger than that on moist isentropes.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The relationship between circulation and entropy transport is also analyzed. A gross stratification is defined as the ratio of the entropy transport to the net transport on isentropic surfaces. It is found that in midlatitudes the gross stability for moist entropy is approximately the same as that for dry entropy. The gross stratification in the midlatitude circulation differs from what one would expect for either an overturning circulation or horizontal mixing; rather, it confirms that warm moist subtropical air ascends into the upper troposphere within the storm tracks.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The wide scale separation between convective motions, responsible for the vertical energy transport, and the planetary circulation, responsible for the meridional energy transport, has prevented explicit representation of convective motions in global atmospheric models. Kuang et~al. (Geophys. Res. Lett. 32: L02809, 2005) have suggested a way to circumvent this limitation through a rescaling that they refer to as Diabatic Acceleration and REscaling (DARE). We focus here on a modified version of the procedure that we refer to as hypohydrostatic rescaling. These two strategies are equivalent for inviscid and adiabatic flow in the traditional meteorological setting in which the vertical component of the Coriolis acceleration is ignored, but they differ when atmospheric physics is taken into account. It is argued here that, while the hypohydrostatic rescaling preserves the dynamics of the planetary scale circulation, it increases the horizontal scale of convective motions. This drastically reduces the computational cost for explicit simulation of hypohydrostatic convection in a global atmospheric model. A key question is whether explicit simulations of hypohydrostatic convection could offer a valid alternative to convective parameterization in global models. To do so, radiative\textendash convective equilibrium is simulated with a high-resolution non-hydrostatic model using different model resolutions and values of the rescaling parameter. When the behavior of hypohydrostatic convection is compared with coarse-resolution simulations of convection, the latter set of simulations reproduce more accurately the result from a reference high-resolution simulation. This is particularly true for the convective velocity and cloud ice distributions. Scaling arguments show that hypohydrostatic rescaling increases the convective overturning time. In particular, this convective slowdown associated with the hypohydrostatic rescaling is more significant than the slowdown resulting from under-resolving the convective elements. These results cast doubt on the practical value of the hypohydrostatic rescaling as an alternative to convective parameterization.},

This approach relies on two key steps. First, mean trajectories are obtained by computing the mean circulation using height and equivalent potential temperature as coordinates. Second, thermodynamic properties along these trajectories are approximated by using their conditionally averaged values at the same height and {$<$}em{$>\theta <$}/em{$>$}\textsubscript{{$<$}em{$>$}e{$<$}/em{$>$}}. This yields a complete description of the properties of air parcels that undergo a set of idealized thermodynamic cycles.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}MAFALDA is applied to analyze the behavior of an atmosphere in radiative\textendash convective equilibrium. The convective overturning is decomposed into 20 thermodynamic cycles, each accounting for 5\% of the total mass transport. The work done by each cycle can be expressed as the difference between the maximum work that would have been done by an equivalent Carnot cycle and a penalty that arises from the injection and removal of water at different values of its Gibbs free energy. The analysis indicates that the Gibbs penalty reduces the work done by all thermodynamic cycles by about 55\%. The cycles are also compared with those obtained for doubling the atmospheric carbon dioxide, which in the model used here leads to an increase in surface temperature of about 3.4 K. It is shown that warming greatly increases both the energy transport and work done per unit mass of air circulated. As a result, the ratio of the kinetic energy generation to the convective mass flux increases by about 20\% in the simulations.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {A multi-layer, quasi-geostrophic, Boussinesq model on a {$\beta$}-channel is used to study the sensitivity of the mid-latitude storm-track to changes in the vertical structure of the zonal mean equilibrium meridional temperature gradient. Motivation for this study is taken from the observation that the doubled CO2 climatology of general-circulation models presents a weaker gradient in the lower troposphere and a stronger gradient in the upper troposphere than in a `control' climatology. It is observed that the dynamics of the quasi-geostrophic model are generally more sensitive to the lower than to the upper tropospheric temperature gradient as a consequence of the importance of shallow eddies. In order to give a good representation of the eddy dynamics it is necessary to use a sufficiently high resolution, which, in the case chosen, proved to be between 10 and 20 tropospheric layers. If only three layers are used the general features of the response are still reproduced, but the model does not represent the sensitivities of the eddy meridional momentum-flux convergence adequately. It is argued that this is connected with the particular choice taken when parametrizing the surface Ekman friction. When a higher-resolution model is used, the eddy momentum-flux convergence proves to be more sensitive to changes in the upper than in the lower meridional equilibrium temperature gradient but is generally much less responsive to these changes than other quantities like the surface eddy potential-vorticity flux or eddy kinetic energy. For each variable the two sensitivities become close to each other as the baroclinicity of the equilibrium flow is increased because of the prevalence of deep eddies in the dynamics, sensitive only to the total radiative equilibrium wind vertical gradient. For very high values of the baroclinicity of the equilibrium flow the sensitivities approach a constant value in accordance with a simple scaling argument.},

Inversion strength plays an important role in regulating atmospheric processes including air pollution, ozone destruction, cloud formation, and negative longwave feedback mechanisms that shape polar climate response to anthropogenic forcing. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument provides reliable measures of spatial patterns in mean wintertime inversion strength when compared with available radiosonde observations and reanalysis products. Here, we examine the influence of sea ice concentration on inversion strength in the Arctic and Antarctic. Correlation of inversion strength with mean annual sea ice concentration, likely a surrogate for the effective thermal conductivity of the wintertime ice pack, yields strong, linear relationships in the Arctic (r~=~0.88) and Antarctic (r~=~0.86). We find a substantially greater (stronger) linear relationship between sea ice concentration and surface air temperature than with temperature at 850~hPa, lending credence to the idea that sea ice controls inversion strength through modulation of surface heat fluxes. As such, declines in sea ice in either hemisphere may imply weaker mean inversions in the future. Comparison of mean inversion strength in AIRS and global climate models (GCMs) suggests that many GCMs poorly characterize mean inversion strength at high latitudes.},

We believe one of the reasons is the shortcomings in the sea ice albedo schemes for these models. This paper investigates a physically based sea ice albedo scheme for ECHAM5 GCM, which separates between snow-covered sea ice, bare sea ice, melt ponds, and open water (separately for the albedos and albedo fractions). The new albedo scheme includes important components such as albedo decay due to snow aging, bare sea ice albedo dependent on the ice thickness, and a melt pond albedo dependent on the melt pond depth. The explicit treatment of melt pond albedos has, to our knowledge, not been included in general circulation models before and represents a substantial improvement when simulating the annual cycle of sea ice albedo. The new albedo scheme overall reduces the sea ice albedo both in winter, because of snow aging, and in summer, because of melt ponds. The reduced sea ice albedo leads to overall reduced sea ice thickness, concentration, and volume, with large temporal and spatial variations. In the Northern Hemisphere in March, some areas experience increased albedo, resulting in thicker sea ice and higher ice concentration, but in August the pattern is spatially homogeneous, with reduced albedo, thickness, and concentrations for all areas where the new scheme has a significant effect.},

  abstract = {Abstract The present paper deals with the analysis of the time-average relative humidity fields in the atmosphere. Twice-daily estimates of relative humidity are used. After some theoretical considerations on the relations between relative humidity, other moisture parameters, and temperature, a critical analysis of the various sources of data is made considering their possible limitations. Various methods of computing relative humidity are formulated and discussed. The global distribution of relative humidity at various levels shows that it is not zonally uniform with centers of various intensities at all latitudes. The global maps show maxima in the equatorial zone and minima in the dry subtropical belts around 30\textdegree N and 30\textdegree S. The land\textendash sea contrast and variations related to the orographic relief are also apparent. The general pattern of relative humidity is similar at all levels but its magnitude decreases with altitude. The seasonal analyses show a similar pattern as the annual analyses but are slightly shifted toward the summer pole. The saturation deficit is also evaluated. Cross sections of the saturation deficit show that the maxima are found in the middle to lower troposphere at subtropical latitudes, being most intense in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer season. The temporal variability of the relative humidity due to transient eddies exhibits a bimodal structure with maxima in the midlatitudes of each hemisphere around 700 mb. The stationary eddy distributions are less pronounced than the transient ones and do not change substantially from one season to another. To validate our results, several comparisons are made using independent sources of humidity data as well as cloud distributions at various levels. Thus, COADS data are used to obtain independent analyses of the surface relative humidity over the oceans, and satellite observations by SAGE are used at the 300-mb level. The rawinsonde-SAGE differences are on the order of 10\% in the Tropics and 20\% in the high latitudes, due in part to a clear-sky (dry) bias in the SAGE data. Our results are further compared with those obtained from operational analyses by the ECMWF. The differences do not exceed 5\% in the Tropics but tend to be larger in the tropical upper troposphere and at all levels in the extratropies of the Southern Hemisphere, where the radiosonde network is quite sparse. In view of the obvious connections between the moisture distribution in the atmosphere and cloudiness, a cloud climatology is used to cheek its consistency with the present results. The latitudinal and interseasonal variations of cloudiness and relative humidity are similar, with maxima in the equatorial belt and at high latitudes and minima in the subtropics that shift poleward during summer and equatorward during winter. Finally, some comments are made on the radiosonde-observing systems in the light of recent satellite studies of humidity. Mainly at the upper levels systematic localized differences are found between electrical hygristor and organic sensors, but the differences almost disappear in the middle and lower troposphere. In spite of the shortcomings, limitations, and errors of the radiosonde network, the present analyses describe for the first time the large-scale, three-dimensional characteristics of the relative humidity in the global atmosphere.},

In these simulations, convective organization varies from semiorganized in cold simulations, disorganized in warm simulations, and abruptly becomes highly organized at just over 300 K. The change in extreme precipitation with warming also varies across these simulations, including a large increase at the transition from disorganized to organized convection.

While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we show that precipitation variability in most climate models increases over a majority of global land area in response to warming (66\% of land has a robust increase in variability of seasonal-mean precipitation). Comparing recent decades to RCP8.5 projections for the end of the 21st century, we find that in the global, multi-model mean, precipitation variability increases 3\textendash 4\%\,K-1 globally, 4\textendash 5\%\,K-1 over land and 2\textendash 4\%\,K-1 over ocean, and is remarkably robust on a range of timescales from daily to decadal. Precipitation variability increases by at least as much as mean precipitation and less than moisture and extreme precipitation for most models, regions, and timescales. We interpret this as being related to an increase in moisture which is partially mitigated by weakening circulation. We show that changes in observed daily variability in station data are consistent with increased variability.},

This conjecture is central to a hypothesis in which Arctic sea ice loss forms the beginning link of a causal chain that includes weaker westerlies in midlatitudes, more persistent and amplified midlatitude waves, and more extreme weather. Through model experimentation, the first step in this chain is examined by quantifying contributions of various physical factors to October\textendash December (OND) mean Arctic tropospheric warming since 1979. The results indicate that the main factors responsible for Arctic tropospheric warming are recent decadal fluctuations and long-term changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs), both located outside the Arctic. Arctic sea ice decline is the largest contributor to near-surface Arctic temperature increases, but it accounts for only about 20\% of the magnitude of 1000\textendash 500-hPa warming. These findings thus disconfirm the hypothesis that deep tropospheric warming in the Arctic during OND has resulted substantially from sea ice loss. Contributions of the same factors to recent midlatitude climate trends are then examined. It is found that pronounced circulation changes over the North Atlantic and North Pacific result mainly from recent decadal ocean fluctuations and internal atmospheric variability, while the effects of sea ice declines are very small. Therefore, a hypothesized causal chain of hemisphere-wide connections originating from Arctic sea ice loss is not supported.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Common assumptions in temperature lapse rate formulas for lifted air parcels include neglecting mixing, hydrostatic balance, the removal of all condensate once it forms (pseudoadiabatic), and/or the retention of all condensate within the parcel (adiabatic). These formulas are commonly derived from the conservation of entropy, which leads to errors when nonequilibrium mixed-phase condensate is present. To evaluate these assumptions, a new general lapse rate formula is derived from an expression for energy conservation, rather than entropy conservation. This new formula incorporates mixing of the parcel with its surroundings, relaxes the hydrostatic assumption, allows for nonequilibrium mixed-phase condensate, and can be formulated for pseudoadiabatic or adiabatic ascent. The new formula is shown to exactly conserve entropy for reversible ascent. Predictions by the new formula are compared to that of older and less general formulas. The errors in previous formulas arise from the assumption of hydrostatic balance, which results in considerable warm biases due to the neglect of the energy sink from buoyancy. Predictions of ascent with entrainment using the new formula are then compared to parcel properties along trajectories in large eddy simulations. Simulated parcel properties are better predicted by the formula using a diluted analogy to adiabatic ascent, wherein condensate is diluted at the same rate as other parcel properties, than by the diluted analogy to pseudoadiabatic ascent, wherein all condensate is removed. These results suggest that CAPE should be computed with adiabatic, rather than pseudoadiabatic, parcel ascent.},

This study uses a one-dimensional moist energy balance model to understand how radiative feedbacks and the structure of an imposed eddy diffusivity can influence such ITCZ shifts. The Planck feedback is shown to damp ITCZ shifts more strongly for extratropical forcings than for tropical ones, because lower moisture content in cold regions makes the temperature response larger there. The water vapor feedback on ITCZ shifts is shown to be dominated by changes in the cross-equatorial asymmetry of the relative humidity of subtropical dry zones, with additional contributions by the changes in mixing ratio that occur at fixed relative humidity and by the meridional shift of the humid ITCZ. Finally, the ITCZ response is found to be highly sensitive to the meridional structure of the diffusivity; the ITCZ shift increases with the tropical diffusivity, even when the global mean diffusivity is fixed.},

In this study, the importance of a particular category of weather systems, namely cyclones, for the occurrence of regional-scale precipitation extremes is quantified globally using the ECMWF Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) dataset. Such an event-based climatological approach complements previous case studies, which established the physical relationship between cyclones and heavy precipitation. A high percentage of precipitation extremes is found to be directly related to cyclones. Regional hot spots are identified where this percentage of cyclone-induced precipitation extremes exceeds 80\% (e.g., in the Mediterranean region, Newfoundland, near Japan, and over the South China Sea). The results suggest that in these regions changes of heavy precipitation with global warming are specifically sensitive to variations in the dynamical forcing, for example, related to shifts of the storm tracks. Furthermore, properties of cyclones causing extreme precipitation are investigated. In the exit regions of the Northern Hemisphere storm tracks, these cyclones are on average slightly more intense than low pressure systems not associated with precipitation extremes, but no differences with respect to minimum core pressure are found in most other parts of the midlatitudes. The fundamental linkage between cyclones and precipitation extremes may thus provide guidance to forecasters involved in flood prediction, but it is unlikely that forecasting rules based on simple cyclone properties can be established.},

The absence of noise in Charney's 1955 test computation with non-divergent ``balanced'' initial data is explained. Finally, the quasi-geostrophic expansion is used to define initial data for a non-linear forecast with the primitive equations. Two cases are considered, that where only the geopotential is known from observations, and that where only the non-divergent part of the wind is known from observation.

We then take up the characterization of subtler aspects of the mixing. It is shown the chaotic advection produces very nonlocal mixing which cannot be represented by eddy diffusivity. Also, the power spectrum of the tracer field is found to be k - l at shortwaves\textemdash precisely as for mixing by homogeneous, isotropic two dimensional turbulence,\textemdash even though the physics of the present case is very different. We have produced two independent arguments accounting for this behavior. We then examine integrations of the unforced barotropic vorticity equation with initial conditions chosen to give a large scale streamline geometry similar to that analyzed in the passive case. It is found that vorticity mixing proceeds along lines similar to passive tracer mixing. Broad regions of homogenized vorticity ultimately surround the separatrices of the large scale streamline pattern, with vorticity gradients limited to nonchaotic regions (regions of tori) in the corresponding passive problem. Vorticity in the chaotic zone takes the form of an arrangement of strands which become progressively finer in scale and progressively more densely packed; this process transfers enstrophy to small scales. Although the enstrophy cascade is entirely controlled by the large scale wave, the shortwave enstrophy spectrum ultimately takes on the classical k - l form. If one accepts that the enstrophy cascade is indeed mediated by chaotic advection, this is the expected behavior. The extreme form of nonlocality (in wavenumber space) manifest in this example casts some doubt on the traditional picture of enstrophy cascade in the Atmosphere, which is based on homogeneous two dimensional turbulence theory. We advance the conjecture that these transfers are in large measure attributable to large scale, low frequency, planetary waves. Upscale energy transfers amplifying the large scale wave do indeed occur in the course of the above-described process. However, the energy transfer is complete long before vorticity mixing has gotten very far, and therefore has little to do with chaotic advection. In this sense, the vorticity involved in the enstrophy cascade is ``fossil vorticity,'' which has already given up its energy to the large scale. We conclude with some speculations concerning statistical mechanics of two dimensional flow, prompted by our finding that flows with identical initial energy and enstrophy can culminate in very different final states. We also outline prospects for further applications of chaotic mixing in atmospheric problems.},

  abstract = {The problem of deglaciating a globally ice-covered (``hard snowball'') Earth is examined using a series of general circulation model simulations. The aim is to determine the amount of CO2 that must be accumulated in the atmosphere in order to trigger deglaciation. Prior treatments of this problem have been limited to energy balance models, which are incapable of treating certain crucial physical processes that turn out to strongly affect the conditions under which deglaciation can occur. CO2 concentrations up to .2 bars are considered in the general circulation model simulations, and even at such high CO2 content the model radiation code is found to perform well in comparison with codes explicitly designed for high CO2. In contrast to prevailing expectations, the hard snowball Earth is found to be nearly 30 K short of deglaciation, even at .2 bars. The very cold climates arise from a combination of the extreme seasonal and diurnal cycle, lapse rate effects, snow cover, and weak cloud effects. Several aspects of the atmospheric dynamics are examined in detail. The simulations indicate that the standard scenario, wherein snowball termination occurs after a few tenths of a bar of CO2 has built up following cessation of weathering, is problematic. However, the climate was found to be sensitive to details of a number of parameterized physical processes, notably clouds and heat transfer through the stable boundary layer. It is not out of the question that other parameterization suites might permit deglaciation. The results should not be construed as meaning that the hard snowball state could not have occurred, but only that deglaciation requires the operation of as-yet undiscovered processes that would enhance the climate sensitivity. A brief survey of some of the possibilities is provided.},

The climate impact is evaluated without employing metrics such as or global warming potentials. The analysis evaluates the impact at all time scales out to 1000 years. It is concluded that certain forms of pastured beef production have substantially lower climate impact than feedlot systems. However, pastured systems that require significant synthetic fertilization, inputs from supplemental feed, or deforestation to create pasture, have substantially greater climate impact at all time scales than the feedlot and dairy-associated systems analyzed. Even the best pastured system analyzed has enough climate impact to justify efforts to limit future growth of beef production, which in any event would be necessary if climate and other ecological concerns were met by a transition to primarily pasture-based systems. Alternate mitigation options are discussed, but barring unforseen technological breakthroughs worldwide consumption at current North American per capita rates appears incompatible with a 2 \textdegree C warming target.},

The carbon cycle disruptions are probably accompanied by changes in the stock of oxidants and connect to glaciations via changes in the atmospheric greenhouse gas content. Two of the glaciations reach low latitudes and may have been Snowball events with near-global ice cover. This review deals primarily with the Cryogenian portion of the Neoproterozoic, during which these glaciations occurred. The initiation and deglaciation of Snowball states are discussed in light of a suite of general circulation model simulations designed to facilitate intercomparison between different models. Snow cover and the nature of the frozen surface emerge as key factors governing initiation and deglaciation. The most comprehensive model discussed confirms the possibility of initiating a Snowball event with a plausible reduction of CO2. Deglaciation requires a combination of elevated CO2 and tropical dust accumulation, aided by some cloud warming. The cause of Neoproterozoic biogeochemical turbulence, and its precise connection with Snowball glaciations, remains obscure.},

Non-dilute dynamics can occur for a wide range of condensibles, generically applying near both the inner and the outer edges of the conventional habitable zone and in connection with runaway greenhouse phenomena. It also applies in a wide variety of other planetary circumstances. We first present a number of analytical results developing some key features of non-dilute atmospheres, and then show how some of these features are manifest in simulations with a general circulation model adapted to handle non-dilute atmospheres. We find that non-dilute atmospheres have weak horizontal temperature gradients even for rapidly rotating planets, and that their circulations are largely barotropic. The relative humidity of the condensible component tends towards 100\% as the atmosphere becomes more non-dilute, which has important implications for runaway greenhouse thresholds. Non-dilute atmospheres exhibit a number of interesting organized convection features, for which there is not yet any adequate theoretical understanding.},

The summary of a storm track as deduced from the linear local baroclinic instability theory is presented. The peak amplitude of the eddies is situated well downstream of the region of maximum baroclinicity of the basic-state flow. Although the maximum westward vertical phase shift occurs at the point of maximum baroclinicity and decreases monotonically with downstream distance, the greatest meridional heat flux occurs in the diffluent region of the jet, somewhat upstream of the site of maximum eddy amplitude. The heat fluxes tend to weaken the large-scale thermal wind in the diffluent region. The vorticity fluxes act to accelerate the barotropic component of the jet at the beginning of the storm track and decelerate it at the downstream end. It is found that the weakened westerlies or low-level easterlies typically found in blocking regions serve to enhance the localization of eddy activity in the block with attendant enhancement of the diffluent pattern.},

There is excellent agreement between simulations and observations in the drier regions, but the simulated brightness temperature exhibits a warm bias within and near moist, convective regions. This bias is most probably due to the neglect of cloud effects in reconstructing the simulated brightness temperature, rather than to a dry bias in the simulation. A second advective simulation, performed with monthly mean rather than full transient winds, led to a substantially drier subtropics. This calculation demonstrates the importance of synoptic scale transient eddies in determining the humidity of the subtropical dry zones. It is speculated on this basis that discontinuous changes in synoptic eddy activity could provide a mechanism for rapid global climate changes.},

  abstract = {Abstract We consider the response of the barotropic vorticity equation on a zonally infinite f-plane or beta-plane to a weak localized vorticity source accompanied by weak Ekman damping. By performing an expansion about the unforced, undamped problem, we derive a solvability condition determining when a slight modification of a solution to the inviscid problem can occur as a solution to the weakly forced and damped problem. This condition states simply that forcing must balance dissipation in the average along each closed streamline. Much of the degeneracy of the inviscid problem is removed by the solvability condition. The above considerations are used to show that under a fairly general set of circumstances the weakly forced system possesses a high amplitude equilibrium state (identified with blocking) and a low amplitude equilibrium state. The high amplitude response is maintained by a local nonlinear resonance phenomenon, and requires the existence of a suitable solution to the inviscid problem, such as the ``modon'' solution. In contrast to cases previously discussed, the multiple equilibrium mechanism we treat is not dependent on global resonance. Explicit examples of local multiple equilibria are constructed through numerical integrations on the f-plant and on a zonally infinite beta-channel. Through introduction of a reasonable amount of meridional confinement, a high amplitude solution can be obtained on the beta-plane without the use of a small radius of deformation. It is suggested that transient eddy fluxes may be able to play the role of the forcing required in our model. A tentative comparison with a blocking event is presented, indicating a number of problematic aspects of the theory.},

  abstract = {Abstract The general nature of two-dimensional mixing on isentropic surfaces in the troposphere has been investigated. The daily time series of isentropic winds is obtained from a global general circulation model and is used to drive a high-resolution fully Lagrangian passive tracer model. Results are compared with the extremes of chaotic mixing by organized waves on the one hand and classical diffusion on the other and are found to lie in the middle ground. Advection by planetary-and synoptic-scale eddies generates small scales from an initially smooth tracer field exponentially fast, but given a modest degree of smoothing the tracer field evolving from a localized release rapidly attains the form of an algebraically spreading cloud. The zonal size of the cloud increases linearly with time (superdiffusively), owing to the systematic shear in the extratropical zonal jets, while the meridional spread has the square-root-of-time increase characteristic of classical diffusion. It is argued, however, that the small-scale tracer structure missing from current general circulation models and from diffusive mixing models severely compromises the fidelity with which chemical reactions and the hydrological cycle can be modeled. Several different analyses, including a study of the spatial distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, indicate the presence of a partial barrier to mixing between the tropics and extratropics. In contrast with previous studies using simpler advecting flow fields, the extratropical mixing regions appear to be zonally homogeneous, and there are no impediments to zonal homogeneization. Our calculations indicate that a zonal wave 3 tracer pattern would be mixed away in 10\textendash 15 days. If the results can be taken as indicative of potential vorticity mixing, the implication is that under normal circumstances mixing due to synoptic eddies exerts a damping effect on planetary-scale waves. Implications of the results for the general circulation of the troposphere are discussed.},

Many salient aspects of the snowball scenario depend critically on the threshold of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations needed to trigger deglaciation2,5. Here I present simulations with a general circulation model, using elevated carbon dioxide levels to estimate this deglaciation threshold. The model simulates several phenomena that are expected to be significant in a `snowball Earth' scenario, but which have not been considered in previous studies with less sophisticated models, such as a reduction of vertical temperature gradients in winter, a reduction in summer tropopause height, the effect of snow cover and a reduction in cloud greenhouse effects. In my simulations, the system remains far short of deglaciation even at atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of 550 times the present levels (0.2\,bar of CO2). I find that at much higher carbon dioxide levels, deglaciation is unlikely unless unknown feedback cycles that are not captured in the model come into effect.},

A simplified Lagrangian model is formulated, and used to study how this process works during the CEPEX period (March, 1993). A key result is that the Northern subtropics should be viewed as a general background of dry air with mass mixing ratio of 10-4 or less on the 330K surface, interrupted by a few coherent moist plumes with mixing ratios on the order of 10-3.},

The pioneering work of Petterssen (1956) on the climatology of cyclogenesis established mountainous terrain as a major contributor to cyclogenesis. Through a study of Northern Hemisphere sea level pressure data from 1899 to 1939, he found distinct maxima in cyclo-genesis and cyclone occurrence in the lee of most of the major mountain ranges of the hemisphere (notably the Rocky Mountains and the Alps). In this context, ``cyclogenesis'' was defined as a fall in pressure of greater than a certain magnitude, and a ``cyclone'' was defined as a region of low pressure. Chung and Reinelt (1973) and Chung et al. (1976) applied similar techniques to subjectively analyzed surface pressure maps for 1958, and essentially confirmed Petterssen's conclusions over North America. In such studies the identification of cyclones with low pressure regions is based on an assumption of approximate geostrophic balance; this can lead to very misleading results in mountainous terrain. Nevertheless, Petterssen's work has played a key role in most subsequent research on lee cyclogenesis, and has served as a major stimulus to the field.},

A primary concern is the extent to which the barrier effect is reduced when smoothed orography is used in a numerical model. These questions are addressed within the model of linear, rotating, stratified flow over topography first studied by Queney. The ground level Green's functions for this model are derived and their near- and far-field asymptotic behavior is discussed. Using the asymptotic results, the upstream deceleration is estimated as a function of Ro=U/fL and hm=Nhm/U, where U is the far upstream speed of the cross-mountain flow, f the Coriolis parameter, L the mountain width, N the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency, and hm is the maximum mountain height. Effects of terrain shape are also considered. The Green's functions are evaluated numerically and used to calculate the response to a family of mountain profiles; a comparison with asymptotic results shows the latter to be very useful. It is concluded that preserving maximum terrain height of ridgelike features is superior to preserving an integrated quantity such as mountain volume. Both the Alps and the Rocky Mountains exert a pronounced barrier effect which would not generally be preserved in present numerical models using smoothed orography.},

  abstract = {Abstract The baroclinic instability characteristics of zonally inhomogeneous basic states are examined with the intent of clarifying the factors governing the regional distribution of cyclogenesis. The vertical shear of the basic state wind is allowed to vary gradually in the zonal direction, so as to permit the representation of zonally localized regions of high baroclinicity. The resulting eigenvalue problem is solved directly by numerical means and also analytically via a WKB analysis. It was established that flows with localized baroclinicity can support two distinct classes of unstable modes, which we call ``local'' and ``global.'' The local modes have peak amplitude downstream of the point of maximum baroclinicity, decay to zero exponentially upstream and downstream of the peak and do not require zonally periodic boundary conditions for their existence. The growth rate of a local mode is equal to the absolute growth rate (in the sense of Merkine) determined locally at the point of maximum shear. The absolute growth rate decreases when the vertically averaged zonal wind is increased, in contrast with the conventional locally determined maximum growth rate. Further properties of the local modes are discussed. The global modes, on the other hand, require periodic boundary conditions for their existence and have growth rates which are sensitive to the average baroclinicity over the domain. Global modes take a much longer time than local modes to emerge from random initial conditions. On the basis of these results, it is suggested that the locally determined absolute growth rate is a useful diagnostic for assessing the stability of inhomogeneous flow. In this connection, a tentative analysis of the results of Frederiksen on planetary wave instabilities was found to be encouraging. Although only a simple model of baroclinic instability was considered in the present work, the techniques developed can be generalized to any kind of instability provided that there is a separation in spatial scale between the eddies and the basic state. It is thus proposed that there is a general link between absolute instability and the instability of nonparallel flow.},

Such clouds are an idealization of the CO2 ice clouds that are thought to have existed early in the history of Mars.

A simplified model of cloud optical effects is used to estimate the effect of high CO2 ice clouds on the planetary radiation budget in the solar and infrared spectrum. It is argued that the scattering greenhouse effect certainly cancels out a large part of the cooling effect due to the cloud's visible albedo and in some circumstances may even lead to a net warming as compared to the no-cloud case. Speculative implications for the climate of early Mars are discussed.},

  abstract = {Although carbon dioxide emissions are by far the most important mediator of anthropogenic climate disruption, a number of shorter-lived substances with atmospheric lifetimes of under a few decades also contribute significantly to the radiative forcing that drives climate change. In recent years, the argument that early and aggressive mitigation of the emission of these substances or their precursors forms an essential part of any climate protection strategy has gained a considerable following. There is often an implication that such control can in some way make up for the current inaction on carbon dioxide emissions. The prime targets for mitigation, known collectively as short-lived climate pollution (SLCP), are methane, hydrofluo-rocarbons, black carbon, and ozone. A re-examination of the issues shows that the benefits of early SLCP mitigation have been greatly exaggerated, largely because of inadequacies in the methodologies used to compare the climate effects of short-lived substances with those of CO2, which causes nearly irreversible climate change persisting millennia after emissions cease. Eventual mitigation of SLCP can make a useful contribution to climate protection, but there is little to be gained by implementing SLCP mitigation before stringent carbon dioxide controls are in place and have caused annual emissions to approach zero. Any earlier implementation of SLCP mitigation that substitutes to any significant extent for carbon dioxide mitigation will lead to a climate irreversibly warmer than will a strategy with delayed SLCP mitigation. SLCP mitigation does not buy time for implementation of stringent controls on CO2 emissions.},

The spatially amplifying disturbance is a hitherto unsuspected part of the response to a pulsating source, and coexists with the more familiar neutral Rossby wavetrains; it is likely to play a role in a wide range of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.The central results rely on a careful application of a causality criterion due to Briggs. These results illustrate a practical means of attacking spatial instability problems, which can be applied to a broad class of systems besides the one at hand. We have found that the Charney problem with positive vertical shear is not absolutely unstable, so long as the wind at the ground is non-negative. This implies that spatial instability and forced stationary-wave problems are well posed in an open domain under typical atmospheric circumstances.The amplifying waves appear on the downstream side of the source, have eastward (downstream) phase propagation and have wavelengths that increase monotonically with decreasing frequency, becoming infinite at zero frequency. When the surface wind is not too large, the spatial amplification rate has a single maximum near the frequency {$\omega$}m = (f/N)Uz, where f is the Coriolis parameter, N is the stability frequency and Uz is the vertical shear; the rate approaches zero at zero frequency and asymptotes algebraically to zero at large frequency for any positive surface wind. Distinct Charney and Green modes do not appear until the surface wind is made very large. The amplification rate at {$\omega$}m becomes infinite as surface wind approaches zero, suggesting a mechanism for the concentration of eddy activity.We also discuss the relationship of these results to the structure of low- and high-frequency atmospheric variability.},

In this model, the meridional flow in the lower layer of a quasi-geostrophic model is blocked by a semi-infinite knife edge barrier extending eastward from the origin. The stability problem for a vertically sheared current parallel to the barrier is solved by means of the Wiener-Hopf technique, and a number of properties of the eigenmodes are determined. The barrier is found to have an inhibitory effect on cyclogenesis, in the sense that the magnitude of the pressure perturbation in the lower layer is reduced in the vicinity of the barrier. However, the barrier also distorts the flow in such a manner as to lead to the formation of a low-level cutoff low south of the barrier, which is characterized by intense easterly winds on the barrierward side of the low. It is also found that at certain phases of the development, the lower-layer velocities have square toot singularities near the tip of the barrier, leading to a discontinuous turning of air flowing around the tip. Air impinging on the barrier from the northwest develops a split jet pattern; the splitting point moves eastward along the barrier with time. The upper layer flow is almost unaffected near the tip of the barrier, but the pressure perturbations in both layers decay algebraically to zero sufficiently far downstream of the tip. Despite the extreme simplicity of the model, some of the features of the solution were found to be suggestive of features found in observations and numerical simulations of cyclogenesis in the lee of the Alps.},

When first suggested, such albedo modification schemes were introduced as a ``Plan B,'' in case the world economy fails to decarbonize, and this scenario has dominated much of the public perception of albedo modification as a savior waiting in the wings to protect the world against massive climate change arising from a failure to decarbonize.But because of the mismatch between the millennial persistence time of carbon dioxide and the sub-decadal persistence of stratospheric particles, albedo modification can never safely play more than a very minor role in the portfolio of solutions. There is simply no substitute for decarbonization.},

This has been done in general terms through consideration of the tropical beat budget and in specific terms through consideration of an idealized radiative-dynamic model of the tropical general circulation. It is argued that evaporation on its own cannot provide an effective regulating mechanism. Clouds cannot serve as regulators unless there are substantial departures from the observed cancellation between cloud greenhouse and cloud albedo effects. In particular, it is shown that the prediction by Ramanathan and Collins of highly stable tropical climates is based on an inconsistent set of assumptions about the behavior of the atmospheric heat transports. When the heat transports are treated in a consistent manner, clouds are found to have little impact, and the tropical climate can he quite sensitive to radiative perturbations.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}It is found that the main determinant of tropical climate is the clear-sky water vapor greenhouse effect averaged over the entire Tropics. In the absence of dry ``radiator fins'' maintained by subsidence, the tropical temperature would tend to fall into a runaway greenhouse state that could be stabilized only by heat export to the extratropics. Some speculative results on sensitivity of the climate to perturbations are presented. Determination of the relative area of dry and subsiding versus moist and convecting regions of the Tropics, and of the degree of dryness of the subsiding regions, are identified as key unsolved problems concerning the tropical climate.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {We have re-examined the inertial range behavior of a passive scalar which is advected by a large-scale velocity field causing a cascade of tracer variance to small scales, where it is dissipated by diffusion. This has been done within the context of an idealized model based on mixing by a 2D area-preserving map alternating with a weak diffusion step; the model is a special case of the general advection-diffusion problem. Both freely decaying and forced equilibrium systems were considered. Our main interest in this concerns the validity of Batchelor's theory predicting a k-1 tracer variance spectrum, but the tracer microstructure has been diagnosed in terms of concentration probability distribution functions, generalized dimensions of the dissipation field, structure functions, and cancellation exponents. 2D simulations carried out at 10242 resolution show that in the decaying case the evolution settles into a `fractal eigenmode' in which the variance decays exponentially with time at a rate dependent on the Lyapunov exponent but independent of the diffusion coefficient. Although the concentration pattern is self-similar with time, the power spectrum is not algebraic. Concentration PDFs have exponential tails. The dissipation field is not multifractal, and formally has Dq=2 for all q. The convergence of the squared-gradient PDFs under coarse-graining indicates some underlying fractal behavior, however, and we have introduced the notion of `fractal degree of freedom' systems to describe such entities. Cancellation exponents and structure functions were also considered, and have a self-similarity which is compatible with a non-intermittent behavior of the dissipation field. These matters have also been addressed for the equilibrium case. The main difference is that the power spectrum of concentration variance in equilibrium exhibits a power-law inertial range, though it is steeper than k-1, but not as steep as k-2. Other features are similar to the decaying case. Very high resolution simulations of the undiffused problem indicate that a k-1 spectrum is approached asymptotically, but only at resolutions corresponding to 106 x 106. The passive scalar behavior is compared and contrasted with the behavior of scalar pseudo-vorticity (an `active scalar') in the family of generalized 2D turbulence models introduced elsewhere in this issue.},

The first class is subharmonic, and corresponds to pairing or localized pairing of vortex tubes; the pairing instability is most unstable in the two-dimensional limit, in which the perturbation has no spanwise variations. The second class repeats in the streamwise direction with the same periodicity as the basic flow. This mode is most unstable for spanwise wavelengths approximately 2/3 of the space between vortex centres, and can lead to the generation of streamwise vorticity and coherent ridges of upwelling.

  abstract = {Abstract The Alpine Experiment (ALPEX) has revealed that low-level air is typically diverted around the Alps without reaching the mountaintop. In pursuit of an understanding of the physical basis of this phenomenon and of its generality, we have explored the characteristics of orographic blocking of a rotating continuously stratified quid, as revealed in a simple model problem retaining full nonlinear and transient effects. Hydrostatic dynamics is assumed, and the obstacle is taken to be an infinitely long ridge with height h(x). The key questions treated are the strength of the upstream deceleration of cross-mountain flow and the length scale over which the decelerated region extends. By means of scale analysis, the controlling parameters are found to be the Rossby number Ro = U/fL and the Froude number Fr = Nhm/U, where U is the speed of the oncoming flow, f is the Coriolis parameter, L the mountain half-width, N the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency, and hm is the maximum mountain height. The scale analysis also determines the qualitative dependence of the strength of the blocking on Ro and Fr; these predictions were confirmed and made quantitative via extensive numerical simulation. In the nonrotating limit, Fr is the sole parameter. In this case, it is found that for sufficiently large Fr a decelerated layer of fluid forms near the obstacle and propagates arbitrarily far upstream with time, in a manner similar to that familiar in one-layer hydraulic theory. The upstream influence requires neither downstream lee wave trains nor vertical confinement by a rigid lid; rather, the upstream modes appear to be generated by wave breaking above the lee slope of the mountain. For a Gaussian mountain profile, wave breaking and upstream influence set in near Fr = 0.75; low-level flow upstream of the mountain is decelerated to rest for Fr {$>$} 1.5. In the rotating case, the decelerated zone does not propagate infinitely far. Instead, it attains a maximum extent on the order of the radius of deformation Nhm/f before retreating toward the mountain. The upstream scales remaining after a long time has passed are also discussed. The theory accounts for a number of aspects of the ALPEX data, as well as for features seen in earlier observations of barrier winds elsewhere. It appears though that the sharp transition between flow over and flow around found in certain ALPEX vertical sounding obtained from aircraft cannot be explained in terms of inviscid theory. It is conjectured that the sharp division is due to low-level convective mixing.},

Temperature profiles measured with a microwave radiometer were used to study the characteristics of surface-based temperature inversions over the course of a year. Statistics of temperature profiles for every month are discussed; the difference between daytime and nocturnal cases observed during the summer months disappears during winter. Surface-based temperature inversions occurred in 70~\% of the time during summer, and almost all of the time during winter. During winter the occurrence of warming events leads to a decrease in the temperature difference between the top and the base of the inversion (i.e. the inversion strength). The inversion strength maxima ranged between \$\$3\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\textbackslash mathrm\{C\}\$\$3{$\circ$}C(December) and \$\$35\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\textbackslash mathrm\{C\}\$\$35{$\circ$}C(August) corresponding to gradients of 0.1 and \$\$0.3\textbackslash,\^\{\textbackslash circ \}\textbackslash mathrm\{C\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash mathrm\{m\}\^\{-1\}\$\$0.3{$\circ$}Cm-1, respectively. The average surface-based inversion height presents a daily cycle during the summer months with values up to 200~m in the morning hours, while it affects a layer always deeper than 100~m during the winter months. The relationships between inversion strength and the downward longwave radiative flux, absolute temperature, and wind speed are examined. The inversion strength decreases as the longwave radiation increases. A clear anti-correlation between inversion strength and near-surface temperature is evident throughout the year. During the winter, the largest inversion strength values were observed under low wind-speed conditions; in contrast, a clear dependence was not found during the summer.},

A 39-year record (1980\textendash 2018) with 2.07 million quality-controlled measurements from 84 stations at 0000 and 1200 UTC is used for the comparison, along with collocated reanalysis profiles. Overall, reanalyses provide similar signals to observations, but ERA5 features lower biases. Over Europe, agreement in the trend signal between rawinsondes and the reanalyses is better, particularly with respect to instability (lifted index), low-level moisture (mixing ratio) and 0\textendash 3 km lapse rates as compared to mixed trends in the United States. However, consistent signals for all three datasets and both domains are found for robust increases in convective inhibition (CIN), downdraft CAPE (DCAPE) and decreases in mean 0\textendash 4 km relative humidity. Despite differing trends between continents, the reanalyses capture well changes in 0\textendash 6 km wind shear and 1\textendash 3 km mean wind with modest increases in the United States and decreases in Europe. However, these changes are mostly insignificant. All datasets indicate consistent warming of almost the entire tropospheric profile, which over Europe is the fastest near-ground, while across the Great Plains generally between 2\textendash 3 km above ground level, thus contributing to increases in CIN. Results of this work show the importance of intercomparing trends between various datasets, as the limitations associated with one reanalysis or observations may lead to uncertainties and lower our confidence in how parameters are changing over time.},

The Radiative Forcing Model Intercomparison Project (RFMIP) endorsed by CMIP6 seeks to provide a foundation for answering the question through three related activities: (i) accurate characterization of the effective radiative forcing relative to a near-preindustrial baseline and careful diagnosis of the components of this forcing; (ii) assessment of the absolute accuracy of clear-sky radiative transfer parameterizations against reference models on the global scales relevant for climate modeling; and (iii) identification of robust model responses to tightly specified aerosol radiative forcing from 1850 to present. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Complete characterization of effective radiative forcing can be accomplished with 180 years (Tier 1) of atmosphere-only simulation using a sea-surface temperature and sea ice concentration climatology derived from the host model's preindustrial control simulation.

Here we use satellite observations to estimate the amount of solar energy that would be added in the worst-case scenario of a complete disappearance of Arctic sea ice throughout the sunlit part of the year. Assuming constant cloudiness, we calculate a global radiative heating of 0.71 W/m2 relative to the 1979 baseline state. This is equivalent to the effect of one trillion tons of CO2 emissions. These results suggest that the additional heating due to complete Arctic sea ice loss would hasten global warming by an estimated 25 years.},

Observations have revealed two preferred states of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water limits surface radiative cooling, and temperature inversions are weak and elevated. In the radiatively clear state, strong surface radiative cooling leads to the build-up of surface-based temperature inversions. Many large-scale models lack the cloudy state, and some substantially underestimate inversion strength in the clear state. Here, the transformation from a moist to a cold dry air mass is modeled using an idealized Lagrangian perspective. The trajectory includes both boundary layer states, and the single-column experiment is the first Lagrangian Arctic air formation experiment (Larcform 1) organized within GEWEX GASS (Global atmospheric system studies). The intercomparison reproduces the typical biases of large-scale models: some models lack the cloudy state of the boundary layer due to the representation of mixed-phase microphysics or to the interaction between micro- and macrophysics. In some models, high emissivities of ice clouds or the lack of an insulating snow layer prevent the build-up of surface-based inversions in the radiatively clear state. Models substantially disagree on the amount of cloud liquid water in the cloudy state and on turbulent heat fluxes under clear skies. Observations of air mass transformations including both boundary layer states would allow for a tighter constraint of model behavior.},

These pulses can cause substantial surface warming and trigger ice melt. Air-mass transport in the opposite direction, away from the Arctic, leads to cold-air outbreaks. The outbreaks are often associated with cold extremes over continents, and extreme surface heat fluxes and occasional polar lows over oceans. Air masses advected across the strong Arctic-to-mid-latitude temperature gradient are rapidly transformed into colder and dryer or warmer and moister air masses by clouds, radiative and turbulent processes, particularly in the boundary layer. Phase changes from liquid to ice within boundary-layer clouds are critical in these air-mass transformations. The presence of liquid water determines the radiative effects of these clouds, whereas the presence of ice is crucial for subsequent cloud decay or dissipation, processes that are poorly represented in weather and climate models. We argue that a better understanding of how air masses are transformed on their way into and out of the Arctic is essential for improved prediction of weather and climate in the Arctic and mid-latitudes. Observational and modelling exercises should take an air-mass-following Lagrangian approach to attain these goals.},

This enhanced hydrological sensitivity has been explained in terms of the Arctic moisture budget and attributed to either moisture advection or surface evaporation. Here, we show that boreal winter moisture availability is less sensitive to surface temperature change in the Arctic than at lower latitudes, questioning a central role of the moisture budget. Hydrological sensitivity, that is, precipitation change per unit temperature change, is similar in models with or without sea-ice changes, suggesting a secondary role of surface flux changes. Instead, we propose that the Arctic's larger hydrological sensitivity is energetically driven. Increases in latent heat release from precipitation locally balance increased atmospheric radiative cooling in Arctic winter, consistent with process-level understanding of radiatively driven cloud and precipitation formation.},

They have important impacts on both radiative and turbulent heat fluxes and partly determine local climate-change feedbacks. Understanding the spread in inversion strength modelled by current global climate models is therefore an important step in better understanding Arctic climate and its present and future changes. Here, we show how the formation of Arctic air masses leads to the emergence of a cloudy and a clear state of the Arctic winter boundary layer. In the cloudy state, cloud liquid water is present, little to no surface radiative cooling occurs and inversions are elevated and relatively weak, whereas surface radiative cooling leads to strong surface-based temperature inversions in the clear state. Comparing model output to observations, we find that most climate models lack a realistic representation of the cloudy state. An idealised single-column model experiment of the formation of Arctic air reveals that this bias is linked to inadequate mixed-phase cloud microphysics, whereas turbulent and conductive heat fluxes control the strength of inversions within the clear state.},

Specifically, the equilibrium temperature distribution has a local subtropical peak and is flat elsewhere, including at the equator. On the basis of inviscid steady-state theory, it is argued that the response to such forcing is one of two distinct types. Below a threshold forcing the atmosphere adopts a steady state of thermal equilibrium with no meridional flow. With supercritical forcing, this state breaks down and a strong meridional circulation is predicted. The threshold forcing value is that at which the absolute vorticity of the zonal flow (in gradient balance with the equilibrium temperatures) vanishes at the upper boundary. These inviscid predictions are tested in a zonally symmetric numerical model; while the model viscosity shifts the threshold and otherwise modifies the response, the threshold is clearly evident in the model behavior.},

If correct, this implies substantial variations in the size of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). However, most climate and ice sheet models have not been able to simulate significant EAIS retreat from continental size, given that atmospheric CO2 levels were relatively low throughout this period. Here, we use a continental ice sheet model to show that mechanisms based on recent observations and analysis have the potential to resolve this model\textendash data conflict. In response to atmospheric and ocean temperatures typical of past warm periods, floating ice shelves may be drastically reduced or removed completely by increased oceanic melting, and by hydrofracturing due to surface melt draining into crevasses. Ice at deep grounding lines may be weakened by hydrofracturing and reduced buttressing, and may fail structurally if stresses exceed the ice yield strength, producing rapid retreat. Incorporating these mechanisms in our ice-sheet model accelerates the expected collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to decadal time scales, and also causes retreat into major East Antarctic subglacial basins, producing {$\sim$}17 m global sea-level rise within a few thousand years. The mechanisms are highly parameterized and should be tested by further process studies. But if accurate, they offer one explanation for past sea-level high stands, and suggest that Antarctica may be more vulnerable to warm climates than in most previous studies.},

Mindful that the observational record is relatively short, and that internal climate variability can be large, the authors here analyze a new 10-member ensemble of integrations of a stratosphere-resolving, atmospheric general circulation model, forced with the observed evolution of sea surface temperature (SST) during 1952\textendash 2003. Previous studies are confirmed, showing that El Ni\~no conditions enhance the frequency of occurrence of stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs), whereas La Ni\~na conditions do not appear to affect it. However, large differences are noted among ensemble members, suggesting caution when interpreting the relatively short observational record. More importantly, it is emphasized that the majority of SSWs are not caused by anomalous tropical Pacific SSTs. Comparing composites of winters with and without SSWs in each ENSO phase separately, it is demonstrated that stratospheric variability gives rise to large and statistically significant anomalies in tropospheric circulation and surface conditions over the North Atlantic and Eurasia. This indicates that, for those regions, climate variability of stratospheric origin is comparable in magnitude to variability originating from tropical Pacific SSTs, so that the occurrence of a single SSW in a given winter is able to completely alter seasonal climate predictions based solely on ENSO conditions. These findings, corroborating other recent studies, highlight the importance of accurately forecasting SSWs for improved seasonal prediction of North Atlantic and Eurasian climate.},

In particular, the relative importance of ozone depletion is contrasted with that of increased greenhouse gases and accompanying sea surface temperature changes. By specifying ozone and greenhouse gas forcings independently, and performing long, time-slice integrations, it is shown that the impacts of ozone depletion are roughly 2\textendash 3 times larger than those associated with increased greenhouse gases, for the Southern Hemisphere tropospheric summer circulation. The formation of the ozone hole is shown to affect not only the polar tropopause and the latitudinal position of the midlatitude jet; it extends to the entire hemisphere, resulting in a broadening of the Hadley cell and a poleward extension of the subtropical dry zones. The CAM3 results are compared to and found to be in excellent agreement with those of the multimodel means of the recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3) and Chemistry\textendash Climate Model Validation (CCMVal2) simulations. This study, therefore, strongly suggests that most Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation changes, in austral summer over the second half of the twentieth century, have been caused by polar stratospheric ozone depletion.},

  abstract = {During the summer, vast regions of Arctic sea ice are covered by meltwater ponds that significantly lower the ice reflectivity and accelerate melting. Ponds develop over the melt season through an initial rapid growth stage followed by drainage through macroscopic holes. Recent analysis of melt pond photographs indicates that late-summer ponds exist near the critical percolation threshold, a special pond coverage fraction below which the ponds are largely disconnected and above which they are highly connected. Here, we show that the percolation threshold, a statistical property of ice topography, constrains pond evolution due to pond drainage through macroscopic holes. We show that it sets the approximate upper limit and scales pond coverage throughout its evolution after the beginning of drainage. Furthermore, we show that the rescaled pond coverage during drainage is a universal function of a single non-dimensional parameter, {$\eta$}, roughly interpreted as the number of drainage holes per characteristic area of the surface. This universal curve allows us to formulate an equation for pond coverage time-evolution during and after pond drainage that captures the dependence on environmental parameters and is supported by observations on undeformed first-year ice. This equation reveals that pond coverage is highly sensitive to environmental parameters, suggesting that modeling uncertainties could be reduced by more directly parameterizing the ponds' natural parameter, {$\eta$}. Our work uncovers previously unrecognized constraints on melt pond physics and places ponds within a broader context of phase transitions and critical phenomena. Therefore, it holds promise for improving ice-albedo parameterizations in large-scale models.},

In the summer, melt ponds form on the surface of Arctic sea ice, significantly lowering the ice reflectivity (albedo) and thereby accelerating ice melt. Pond geometry controls the details of this crucial feedback; however, a reliable model of pond geometry does not currently exist. Here we show that a simple model of voids surrounding randomly sized and placed overlapping circles reproduces the essential features of pond patterns. The only two model parameters, characteristic circle radius and coverage fraction, are chosen by comparing, between the model and the aerial photographs of the ponds, two correlation functions which determine the typical pond size and their connectedness. Using these parameters, the void model robustly reproduces the ponds' area-perimeter and area-abundance relationships over more than 6 orders of magnitude. By analyzing the correlation functions of ponds on several dates, we also find that the pond scale and the connectedness are surprisingly constant across different years and ice types. Moreover, we find that ponds resemble percolation clusters near the percolation threshold. These results demonstrate that the geometry and abundance of Arctic melt ponds can be simply described, which can be exploited in future models of Arctic melt ponds that would improve predictions of the response of sea ice to Arctic warming.},

Snow on top of the ice decreases ice's thermal conductivity, increases its reflectivity (albedo), and provides a source of meltwater for melt ponds during summer that decrease the ice's albedo. In this paper, we develop a simple model of premelt snow topography that accurately describes snow cover of flat, undeformed Arctic sea ice on several study sites for which data were available. The model considers a surface that is a sum of randomly sized and placed ``snow dunes'' represented as Gaussian mounds. This model generalizes the ``void model'' of Popovi\'c et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.148701) and, as such, accurately describes the statistics of melt pond geometry. We test this model against detailed LiDAR measurements of the premelt snow topography. We show that the model snow depth distribution is statistically indistinguishable from the measurements on flat ice, while small disagreement exists if the ice is deformed. We then use this model to determine analytic expressions for the conductive heat flux through the ice and for melt pond coverage evolution during an early stage of pond formation. We also formulate a criterion for ice to remain pond-free throughout the summer. Results from our model could be directly included in large-scale models, thereby improving our understanding of energy balance on sea ice and allowing for more reliable predictions of Arctic sea ice in a future climate.},

  abstract = {Convective clustering, the spatial organization of tropical deep convection, can manifest itself in two ways: through a decrease in the total area covered by convection and/or through a decrease in the number of convective areas. Much of our current understanding of convective clustering comes from simulations in idealized radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) configurations. In these simulations the two forms of convective clustering tend to covary, and their individual effects on the climate are thus hard to disentangle. This study shows that in aquaplanet simulations with more realistic boundary conditions, such as meridional gradients of surface temperature and rotational forces, the two aspects of convective clustering are not equivalent and are associated with different impacts on the large-scale climate. For instance, reducing the convective area in the equatorial region in the aquaplanet simulations results in broader meridional humidity and rain distributions and in lower tropospheric temperatures throughout the tropics. By contrast, the number of convective regions primarily impacts the zonal variance of humidity-related quantities in the aquaplanet simulations, as the distribution of convective regions affects the size of the subsidence regions and thereby the moistening influence of convective regions. The aquaplanet simulations confirm many other qualitative results from RCE simulations, such as a reduction of equatorial tropospheric humidity when the area covered by convection diminishes.},

  abstract = {Water-rich planets such as Earth are expected to become eventually uninhabitable, because liquid water turns unstable at the surface as temperatures increase with solar luminosity. Whether a large increase of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2 could also destroy the habitability of water-rich planets has remained unclear. Here we show with three-dimensional aqua-planet simulations that CO2-induced forcing as readily destabilizes the climate as does solar forcing. The climate instability is caused by a positive cloud feedback and leads to a new steady state with global-mean sea-surface temperatures above 330\,K. The upper atmosphere is considerably moister in this warm state than in the reference climate, implying that the planet would be subject to substantial loss of water to space. For some elevated CO2 or solar forcings, we find both cold and warm equilibrium states, implying that the climate transition cannot be reversed by removing the additional forcing.},

We investigate these issues by analyzing convective clustering, and the link between clustering and ITCZ properties in 18 climate models. We find that the links between variability in convective clustering and variability of ITCZ properties are generally weaker and less robust in models than in observations. By contrast, model biases in the climatological convective clustering explain a substantial fraction of the climatological double-ITCZ bias, though they do not explain biases in the climatological ITCZ width.},

The remaining components of the energy budget, comprising of the energy storage, horizontal convergence of energy, and the net surface flux between the atmospheric and subsurface columns, are compiled using data from the Japanese 25 Year Reanalysis Project (JRA) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) /National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Reanalysis (NRA). The annual cycles of energy budget components for the polar cap are fairly consistent between the JRA and NRA, but with some systematic differences. JRA depicts an annual mean surface flux of 14 W m-2 (upward), compared to only 5 W m-2 in NRA. Most of this disparity appears to be due to differences in sea ice and albedo. Horizontal atmospheric energy flux divergence calculated using mass-corrected flux values contains artifacts leading to unphysical results. We argue that backing out the energy flux convergence as a residual from the net surface heat flux and time change in energy storage from each reanalysis, and the TOA radiation budget from CERES, provides for more physically realistic results in the Arctic. Monthly mean anomalies of budget terms, used to examine conditions leading to the extreme seasonal sea ice extent minimum of September 2005, point to the importance of albedo feedback.},

Because the WRF model is increasingly being run over larger spatial and temporal scales, an assessment of its ability to reconstruct basic properties of regional climates, such as terms in the energy budget, is crucial. Estimates of the Arctic energy budget from WRF are compared with estimates from reanalyses and satellite observations. The WRF model was run on a large pan-Arctic domain continuously from 2000 to 2008. Apart from a few systematic shortcomings, WRF sufficiently captures the Arctic energy budget. The major deficiency, with differences from reanalyses and satellite observations as large as 40 W m-2 in summer months, is in the shortwave radiative fluxes at both the surface and top of atmosphere (TOA). WRF's positive bias in upwelling shortwave radiation is due to a specified constant sea ice albedo of 0.8, which is too high during the summer. When sea ice albedo in WRF is allowed to vary in a more realistic manner in a test simulation, both surface and TOA energy budget components improve, while showing little impact on the atmospheric energy convergence and storage. A second, similar WRF simulation was performed but with gridded nudging enabled. When the large-scale circulation is constrained to the forcing data, the two energy budget terms that are most dependent on weather patterns, the convergence of atmospheric energy transport and the tendency of column-integrated energy, closely resemble their reanalysis counterparts.},

Three simulations were completed with different continental distributions. Each simulation included a reduced solar luminosity (93\% of present-day) and low atmospheric CO2 (140 ppmv). Model results indicate that a low-latitude concentration of continents leads to lower tropical temperatures, through reduced receipt of shortwave radiation and a smaller tropical greenhouse effect, but does not significantly affect high-latitude temperatures or sea-ice extent. In contrast, the presence of snow-covered, mid- and high-latitude continents increases the sensible heat transport over the ocean, giving rise to sea-surface cooling, deep-water formation, and an advanced sea-ice margin. Nonetheless, an ice-covered Earth is not simulated in these experiments.},

These mechanisms include both local feedbacks and changes in poleward energy transport. Temperature and sea ice-related feedbacks are especially important for AA, since they are significantly more positive over the Arctic than at lower latitudes. Changes in energy transport by the atmosphere and ocean can also contribute to AA. These energy transport changes are tightly coupled with local feedbacks, and thus their respective contributions to AA should not be considered in isolation. It is here emphasized that the feedbacks and energy transport changes that give rise to AA are sensitively dependent on the state of the climate system itself. This implies that changes in the climate state will lead to changes in the strength of AA, with implications for past and future climate change.},

In previous work the representation of the extratropical storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere was found to have improved from the 5th to 6th coupled model intercomparison project. Here we investigate the remaining and persistent biases in models from the 6th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), by contrasting the atmosphere-only simulations (AMIP6) with the historical coupled simulations (CMIP6). The comparison of AMIP6 and CMIP6 simulations reveal that biases in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in the coupled simulations across the North Pacific in winter modify the atmospheric temperature gradient, which is associated with an equatorward bias of the storm track. In the North Atlantic, cyclones do not propagate poleward enough in coupled simulations, which is partly driven by cold SSTs to the south of Greenland, decreasing the latent heat fluxes. In summer, excessive heating across central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau reduces the local baroclinicity causing fewer cyclones to form and propagate from eastern China into the North Pacific in both the coupled and atmosphere-only simulations. Several of the biases described in the coupled models are reduced considerably in the atmosphere-only models when the SSTs are prescribed. For example the equatorward bias of the North Pacific storm track is reduced significantly. However, other biases are apparent in both CMIP6 and AMIP6 (e.g. persistent reduction in track density and cyclogenesis over eastern Asia in Summer), which are associated with other processes (e.g. land surface temperatures).},

Using the new CMIP6 models, we investigate changes to seasonal mean storm tracks and composite wind speeds at different levels of the troposphere for the winter and summer seasons in both the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH). Changes are assessed across four different climate scenarios. The seasonal mean storm tracks are predicted to shift polewards in the SH and also in the North Pacific, with an extension into Europe for the North Atlantic storm track. Overall, the number of cyclones will decrease by {$\sim$}5 \% by the end of the 21st century, although the number of extreme cyclones will increase by 4 \% in NH winter. Cyclone wind speeds are projected to strengthen throughout the troposphere in the winter seasons and also summer in the SH, with a weakening projected in NH summer, although there are minimal changes in the maximum wind speed in the lower troposphere. Changes in wind speeds are concentrated in the warm sector of cyclones, and the area of extreme winds may be up to 40 \% larger by the end of the century. The largest changes are seen for the SSP5-85 scenario, although a large amount of change can be mitigated by restricting warming to that seen in the SSP1-26 and 2-45 scenarios.

Results from an aquaplanet setup with localized subtropical forcing are compared with a continental case. It is found that the meridional circulation that develops is close to angular momentum conserving for cross-equatorial circulation cells, both in the aquaplanet and in the continental cases. The equator proves to be a substantial barrier to boundary layer meridional flow; flow into the summer hemisphere from the winter hemisphere tends to occur in the free troposphere rather than in the boundary layer. A theory is proposed to explain the location of the monsoon; assuming quasiequilibrium, the poleward boundary of the monsoon circulation is collocated with the maximum in subcloud moist static energy, with the monsoon rains occurring near and slightly equatorward of this maximum. The model results support this theory of monsoon location, and it is found that the subcloud moist static energy distribution is determined by a balance between surface forcing and advection by the large-scale flow.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Diurnal variations of the Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ) and vertical motions have been related to the development of summer precipitation individually, but their underlying connection and consequences for the nocturnal and afternoon precipitation peaks are less discussed. This paper examines how together they help explain the spatial pattern of the frequency of summer convective precipitation over the Great Plains. A one-layer linearized boundary layer model is used to reproduce the diurnal cycle of the GPLLJ. Its periodic rising and sinking motions compare favorably with those of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) climatology. Its development of rising motion is also consistent with the enhanced occurrence of nocturnal convective precipitation over the central and eastern Great Plains (90\textdegree\textendash 100\textdegree W) and afternoon maximum over the western Great Plains (100\textdegree\textendash 105\textdegree W). The diurnal phasing of the vertical motions can be captured by the model only if the diurnal oscillation of the jet is forced by both near surface geopotential gradients and friction with observed diurnal variability. The diurnal variation of the vertical velocity (or boundary layer convergence and divergence) is explained by local vorticity balance; that is, following the diurnal oscillation of the jet, the zonal gradient of the meridional wind oscillates and, thus, relative vorticity and its tendency. The slowing down of the jet after midnight decreases the anticyclonic (cyclonic) vorticity and consequently gives a positive (negative) vorticity tendency to the east (west) of the jet core; anomalous rising (sinking) motions occur to balance these positive (negative) vorticity tendencies. The pattern reverses when the jet is relatively weak.},

This study extends previous strengthening trend analyses of the Hadley cell to the Polar and Arctic cells in the Northern Hemisphere and explores their climate influences. Results show that the Polar cell experienced an abrupt change from a slow to a rapid strengthening trend in 1989, while the Arctic cell showed an insignificant strengthening trend and a significant weakening trend successively. The strengthening subsidence flow associated with the Polar and Arctic cells can partly explain the warming surface air temperature and declining sea ice concentration through the increasing tropospheric height and temperature trends. These results provide new insights for understanding the interdecadal relationship between atmospheric circulation and climate change in the Arctic region.},

However, two questions, why the upper level flow of Ferrel cell does not match observations and how many cells exist in the two polar regions, still exist. Using three different reanalysis datasets for the last 30~years, this paper showed that there might be an additional cell in each of two polar regions. The analyses of meridional-vertical section streamline (MSS), meridional-mass stream function (MSF), and climatic vertical velocity provide some evidences to support the existence of the new Arctic and Antarctic cells located in the troposphere. Thus, an eight-cell model in the global troposphere is proposed in this study. The maximum intensity of the Hadley cell in the boreal winter indicated by MSF in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) is stronger than that of the Ferrel cell for about 4.8 times, so the upper level northeasterly wind of Ferrel cell is too weak to be detected when compared with the stronger southwesterly wind of the Hadley cell.},

The atmosphere accounts for much more of climatological planetary albedo ({$\geq$}75\%) than the surface at all times of the year. The insignificance of the surface contribution over highly reflective cryosphere regions is attributed mostly to the damping effect of the atmosphere. The overlying atmosphere attenuates the surface's contribution to climatological planetary albedo by reducing the number of solar photons initially reaching the surface and the number of photons initially reflected by the surface that actually reach the top of the atmosphere. The ISCCP datasets were also used to determine the relative contributions of the surface and atmosphere to seasonal and interannual planetary albedo variability in cryosphere regions. Even damped by the atmosphere to the same degree as in the climatological case, the surface contribution dominates the variability in planetary albedo on seasonal and interannual time scales. The surface accounts for about 75\% of the change in climatological planetary albedo from one season to another with similar zenith angle and more than 50\% of its interannual variability at nearly all times of the year, especially during seasons with extensive snow and sea ice extent. The dominance of the surface in planetary albedo variability is because surface albedo variability associated with snow and ice fluctuations is significantly larger than atmospheric albedo variability due to cloud fluctuations. The large effect of snow and ice variations on planetary albedo variability suggests that if cloud fields do not change much in a future warmer climate, a retreat of snow cover or sea ice would lead to a significant increase in net incoming solar radiation, resulting in an enhancement of high-latitude climate sensitivity.},

In contrast, climate model simulations tend to exhibit strong negative sea-ice trends for the same period. This Antarctic sea-ice paradox leads to low confidence in 21st-century sea-ice projections. Here we present multi-resolution climate change projections that account for Southern Ocean mesoscale eddies. The high-resolution configuration simulates stable September Antarctic sea-ice extent that is not projected to decline until the mid-21st century. We argue that one reason for this finding is a more realistic ocean circulation that increases the equatorward heat transport response to global warming. As a result, the ocean becomes more efficient at moderating the anthropogenic warming around Antarctica and hence at delaying sea-ice decline. Our study suggests that explicitly simulating Southern Ocean eddies is necessary for providing Antarctic sea-ice projections with higher confidence.},

  abstract = {Global warming caused by anthropogenic CO2 emissions is expected to reduce the capability of the ocean and the land biosphere to take up carbon. This will enlarge the fraction of the CO2 emissions remaining in the atmosphere, which in turn will reinforce future climate change. Recent model studies agree in the existence of such a positive climate\textendash carbon cycle feedback, but the estimates of its amplitude differ by an order of magnitude, which considerably increases the uncertainty in future climate projections. Therefore we discuss, in how far a particular process or component of the carbon cycle can be identified, that potentially contributes most to the positive feedback. The discussion is based on simulations with a carbon cycle model, which is embedded in the atmosphere/ocean general circulation model ECHAM5/MPI-OM. Two simulations covering the period 1860\textendash 2100 are conducted to determine the impact of global warming on the carbon cycle. Forced by historical and future carbon dioxide emissions (following the scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), they reveal a noticeable positive climate\textendash carbon cycle feedback, which is mainly driven by the tropical land biosphere. The oceans contribute much less to the positive feedback and the temperate/boreal terrestrial biosphere induces a minor negative feedback. The contrasting behavior of the tropical and temperate/boreal land biosphere is mostly attributed to opposite trends in their net primary productivity (NPP) under global warming conditions. As these findings depend on the model employed they are compared with results derived from other climate\textendash carbon cycle models, which participated in the Coupled Climate\textendash Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP).},

Here we review and revise CO2 reconstructions from boron isotopes in carbonates and carbon isotopes in organic matter over the Cenozoic\textemdash the past 66 million years.

Around two-thirds of Cenozoic CO2 drawdown is explained by an increase in the ratio of ocean alkalinity to dissolved inorganic carbon, likely linked to a change in the balance of weathering to outgassing, with the remaining one-third due to changing ocean temperature and major ion composition. Earth system climate sensitivity is explored and may vary between different time intervals. The Cenozoic CO2 record highlights the truly geological scale of anthropogenic CO2 change: Current CO2 levels were last seen around 3 million years ago, and major cuts in emissions are required to prevent a return to the CO2 levels of the Miocene or Eocene in the coming century. {$\blacksquare$} CO2 reconstructions over the past 66 Myr from boron isotopes and alkenones are reviewed and re-evaluated. {$\blacksquare$} CO2 estimates from the different proxies show close agreement, yielding a consistent picture of the evolution of the ocean-atmosphere CO2 system over the Cenozoic. {$\blacksquare$} CO2 and climate are coupled throughout the past 66 Myr, providing broad constraints on Earth system climate sensitivity. {$\blacksquare$} Twenty-first-century carbon emissions have the potential to return CO2 to levels not seen since the much warmer climates of Earth's distant past.},

Although many of the best-known early climate models used prescribed clouds (e.g., Manabe and Bryan, 1969), the importance of potential changes in cloudiness for the problem of climate change has been recognized as a key factor since the 1970s (e.g., Arakawa, 1975; Charney et al., 1979). In particular, it is now widely appreciated that ``cloud feedback'' is a key source of uncertainty limiting the reliability of simulations of anthropogenic climate change (e.g., Houghton et al., 1990).Nevertheless the whole concept of cloud feedback continues to be obscure, in part because the term ``cloud feedback'' is often used without being properly defined at all, and is rarely given a definition precise enough to show how it can be quantitatively measured. Further confusion arises from the fact that there are in fact many types of cloud feedbacks (e.g., Schneider, 1972; Schlesinger, 1985; 1988; 1989; Wielicki et al., 1995). In addition, it is widely perceived that existing atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are incapable of making quantitatively realistic simulations of cloudiness.The purposes of this chapter are to give a definition of cloud feedback, to discuss some particular types of cloud feedback, and to assess the prospects for simulations of cloud feedback on anthropogenic climate change.},

Water vapor observations are from combined Halogen Occultation Experiment and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite measurements, and cold point temperatures are from high quality radiosondes and GPS satellite data. Interannual water vapor anomalies are highly correlated with TCP, and coherent patterns can be traced in space and time away from the tropical tropopause to quantify transport in the Brewer-Dobson circulation, including diagnosing seasonal changes in circulation. Lagged regressions with TCP are used to reconstruct water vapor variations directly tied to the cold point, and these reconstructions account for a majority of the observed interannual water vapor variability in the lower to middle stratosphere over most of the globe. Small systematic differences from observed water vapor can identify processes not tied to zonal average TCP, and/or possible uncertainties in the satellite measurements.},

The processes maintaining these maxima are not well understood. We analyze the variability of water vapor in the monsoon regions based on Aura Microwave Limb Sounder satellite observations during 2005\textendash 2013 and quantify links to deep convection, large-scale temperatures, and monsoonal circulations. Strong subseasonal variations in stratospheric water vapor are closely linked with deep convection in the monsoon regions, with the surprising result that stronger convection leads to a relatively dry stratosphere and weaker convection to a wetter stratosphere. This result is observed for both the Asian and NA monsoon regions. This behavior is explained by temperature changes in the stratosphere tied to deep convection: stronger convection leads to relatively cold temperatures in the subtropical lower stratosphere, which is the key region controlling large-scale dehydration within the anticyclonic monsoonal circulations. Likewise, weaker convection leads to warmer subtropical stratospheric temperatures, relatively less dehydration, and enhanced water vapor. The observed water vapor changes are in approximate agreement with those expected from the subtropical temperature variations, taking into account dilution of the dehydrated air into the larger monsoon region. These results demonstrate that stratospheric water vapor in the Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions is mainly controlled by large-scale circulation and temperatures, and overshooting deep convection plays a relatively minor role.},

  abstract = {Systematic research of polar lows began in the 1960s with Harrold and Browning (1969). Almost from the very beginning, Richard Reed (RR) contributed to the research into this ``new'' phenomenon through a number of significant papers. A perusal of RR's papers on this subject shows that he, in several cases, was the first to point out significant features of these systems, introduced new ideas, and pointed out problems related to the formation and dynamics of polar lows. Reed in this way had a big influence in introducing the relatively unknown concept of ``polar lows'' into the common meteorological vocabulary. On the other hand, he recently and quite ironically, has introduced some question marks regarding the concept, such as shown by the title of an invited paper: ``Is there such a thing as a polar low?'' (10th Cyclone Workshop, 21\textendash 27 September 1997, Val Morin, Quebec, Canada). In an attempt to answer that question the history of polar low research is briefly reviewed and illustrated mainly by the 12 RR papers listed in the reference section.},

  abstract = {Abstract The authors have empirically examined the dependence of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) on sea surface temperature (Ts), precipitable water (W), and height-mean relative humidity (RH\textasciimacron ). The OLR is obtained from 4 yr of data from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), while Ts, W, and RH\textasciimacron{} are obtained from objective analyses of rawinsonde and ship data. It is found that in the midlatitudes, the surface temperature explains over 80\% of the variability in the clear-sky OLR (Fcs) and almost half of the variability in the total OLR (Ftot). It fails badly in the tropics and subtropics, however, where (Ts explains only about 20\% of the variability in (Fcs, and is largely decoupled from Ftot. The two-dimensional contour plot of the OLR binned with respect to Ts and RH\textasciimacron{} is marked by distinct changes in the gradient that are consistent with inferences from earlier investigations. For low values of Ts ({$<$}10\textdegree C), the OLR depends mainly on Ts. For values of Ts above 10\textdegree C, the OLR depends increasingly on RH\textasciimacron. Specifically, in the tropics (Ts\texttildelow 25\textdegree C), the total and clear-sky OLR depend significantly on both Ts and RH\textasciimacron. The well-known drop in OLR in the tropics with increasing Ts correlates directly to an increase in RH\textasciimacron, and not to changes in Ts. The authors suggest that the observed dependence of the OLR on Ts and RH\textasciimacron{} be a minimum performance standard for climate models. This approach is illustrated by comparing the observed dependence with the results of a radiative transfer model and an R 15 general circulation model, and by discussing the strengths and limitations of using RH\textasciimacron{} to parameterize the OLR.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis of convective quasi-equilibrium states that moist convection reacts almost instantly to drive the atmospheric temperature profile throughout the troposphere to one of a special subset of possible profiles. In a simple case this might consist of a moist adiabat with the saturated moist entropy of the adiabat equaling the moist entropy of the boundary layer. In more complex cases the target temperature profile might depend on the moisture profile as well as boundary layer conditions. We present evidence from analytical and numerical calculations which challenge the validity of this hypothesis. These calculations involve both a simple, physically based parameterization of the effects of convection on its environment and a complex cloud-resolving model. In both cases we show that imposed temperature perturbations in the lower troposphere are rapidly eliminated, while those in the upper troposphere are not. The rapid temperature relaxation in the lower troposphere is due to the near-instantaneous change in the precipitation rate and latent heat release provoked by the temperature anomaly. Water vapor is so limited in the upper troposphere that this process cannot act there.},

  abstract = {Abstract An explosive cyclogenesis that occurred in the eastern Pacific on 13 November 1981 is described and discussed on the basis of surface and upper air analyses and satellite imagery. During one 12-h period the storm deepened by nearly 40 mb and subsequently attained a central pressure of 950 mb or less. Peak surface winds were in the 45\textendash 50 m s-1 range. The Limited Area Fine Mesh (LFM) model 24-h forecast initialized at 0000 GMT on the thirteenth completely failed to predict the storm development. The development took place within a strong baroclinic zone, as a shallow frontal wave traveled from the relatively stable environment of a long-wave ridge to the unstable environment of a long-wave trough. Winds at jet stream level exceeded 90 m s-1 prior to the explosive deepening. The lifted index in and ahead of the storm diminished and became negative prior to the rapid intensification. Measurements revealed that sensible and latent heat fluxes from the ocean contributed significantly to the reduced stability. Low-level advection of warm, moist air was perhaps an even greater cause of the reduction. Further evidence of the instability was afforded by satellite imagery, which showed outbreaks of deep convection at the leading edge of the warm frontal cloud band and along the upper part of the cold front. Very dry, ozone-rich air aloft penetrated the cyclone from the rear at the beginning of the rapid-deepening stage. The fully developed cyclone possessed a warm, hurricane-like core in the 1000\textendash 500 mb thickness. However, the spiral-shaped cloud pattern was typical of an extratropical occluded cyclone, and surface ship and buoy observations revealed an intertwining of warm and colder air within the core. A north-south cross section taken through the storm early in the deepening stage showed that the surface front was a shallow feature embedded within a zone of broad and deep baroclinity. A moist-neutral lapse rate prevailed within the frontal cloud band. The band was highly symmetrically unstable and would have remained symmetrically unstable had the lapse rate been considerably more stable. The rapid intensification is attributed to strong, deep baroclinic forcing in the presence of small effective static stability. The latter term, as used here, denotes the existence of weak or neutral static stability in the precipitating cloud mass combined with below normal dry static stability in the environment.},

Elevated convection above a surface frontal boundary is one explanation, but this study shows that many thunderstorms form at night without the presence of an elevated frontal inversion or nearby surface boundary. This study documents convection initiation (CI) events at night over the central Great Plains from 1996 to 2015 during the months of April\textendash July. Storm characteristics such as storm type, linear system orientation, initiation time and location, and others were documented. Once all of the cases were documented, surface data were examined to locate any nearby surface boundaries. The event's initiation location relative to these boundaries (if a boundary existed) was documented. Two main initiation locations relative to a surface boundary were identified: on a surface boundary and on the cold side of a surface boundary; CI events also occur without any nearby surface boundary. There are many differences among the different nocturnal CI modes. For example, there appear to be two main peaks of initiation time at night: one early at night and one later at night. The later peak is likely due to the events that form without a nearby surface boundary. Finally, a case study of three nocturnal CI events that occurred during the Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) field project when there was no nearby surface boundary is discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract We hypothesize that periods of quasi-stationary behavior in the large scales are integrally associated with an organized behavior of the synoptic scales, thus the terminology ``weather regime.'' To investigate our hypothesis, we extend the model of Charney and Straus (1980) to include an additional wave in the zonal direction which is highly baroclinically unstable and can interact directly with the externally forced large-scale wave. We find that such a model aperiodically vacillates between two distinct weather regime states which are not located near any of the stationary equilibria of the large-scale state; thus, we cannot ascertain the qualitative behavior of the large-scale flow in our model knowing only the large-scale equilibria and their respective stabilities to perturbations on the scale of the equilibria. The state of the model flow may remain in either one of the two regime states for several synoptic periods. During each of the two regimes, the net transports by the transient disturbances are found to have consistent, zonally inhomogeneous structure, the form of which depends upon the regime. This result implies that the transports appear as a net additional external forcing mechanism to the large-scale wave, accounting for the differences between the time-mean regime state and the stationary equilibria. Following the analysis procedure of Frederiksen (1979), we show that the observed structure of these net transports can be accounted for by the spatial modulation of the baroclinically most unstable eigenmodes by the large-scale wave. We then consider only the tendency equations of the large-scale variables where the effects of the transients are parameterized by solving the stability problem at each time step. We find that such a dynamical system possesses two absolutely stable ``regime-equilibria'' which are very close in phase space to the time mean states of the regimes appearing in the full model. We then demonstrate that the instantaneous component of the transients are also capable of transferring the state of the model flow from the attractor basin of one of the stable regime-equilibria to the attractor basin of the other. Our experiments thus indicate that the transients are important in determining the qualitative behavior of both the instantaneous and time-mean components of the large-scale flow in our system, and suggest that the very different short-range climates in the atmosphere can result from entirely internal processes.},

We show that when the hydrologic cycle is included in the model a subcritical bifurcation occurs, leading to 2 linearly stable solutions to the radiative-convective equilibria. In this case, when the net forcing is larger than a critical value, two equilibria are possible. Furthermore, a finite amplitude instability can lead to a runaway greenhouse regime when the solar forcing is larger than a second critical value. In general, previous climate studies with radiative-convective models did not include a hydrologic cycle. Instead, the atmosphere's water vapor mixing ratio was diagnosed based on the climatological profile of relative humidity. We show that fixing the water vapor relative humidity profile at the climatological value (in the computation of the radiation fluxes only) leads to a unique stable solution to the radiative-convective equilibria. Thus, the crucial part of the hydrologic cycle which allows multiple solutions is the relaxation of the assumption of a climatological relative humidity profile. Our results do not apply directly to any real planet because of large uncertainties in our calculation due to the absence of clouds and the use of a one-dimensional model. The 1st equilibrium corresponds to an optically thin atmosphere. In this regime, the system is nearly linear and is in a state of small dissipation. The 2nd equilibrium corresponds to an optically thick atmosphere. In this 2nd regime, the system is highly nonlinear and is in a state of large dissipation.},

Since the heat source is located at higher pressure than the heat sink, the system is capable of doing mechanical work. Atmospheric convection is a natural heat engine that might operate in this system. Based on the heat engine framework, a simple theory is presented for atmospheric convection that predicts the buoyancy, the vertical velocity, and the fractional area covered by either dry or moist convection in a state of statistical equilibrium. During one cycle of the convective heat engine, heat is taken from the surface layer (the hot source) and a portion of it is rejected to the free troposphere (the cold sink) from where it is radiated to space. The balance is transformed into mechanical work. The mechanical work is expended in the maintenance of the convective motions against mechanical dissipation. Ultimately, the energy dissipated by mechanical friction is transformed into heat. Then, a fraction of the dissipated energy is radiated to space while the remaining portion is recycled by the convecting air parcels. Increases in the fraction of energy dissipated at warmer temperature, at the expense of decreases in the fraction of energy dissipated at colder temperatures, lead to increases in the apparent efficiency of the convective heat engine. The volume integral of the work produced by the convective heat engine gives a measure of the statistical equilibrium amount of convective available potential energy (CAPE) that must be present in the planet's atmosphere so that the convective motions can be maintained against viscous dissipation. This integral is a fundamental global number qualifying the state of the planet in statistical equilibrium conditions. For the earth's present climate, the heat engine framework predicts a CAPE value of the order of 1000 J kg\textsuperscript{-1} for the tropical atmosphere. This value is in agreement with observations. It also follows from our results that the total amount of CAPE present in a convecting atmosphere should increase with increases in the global surface temperature (or the atmosphere's opacity to infrared radiation).{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {The one-dimensional radiative-connective equilibrium model with an explicit hydrologic cycle introduced in part 1 is used to study the sensitivity of the model's atmosphere to large changes in the solar forcing, when various cumulus convection parameterizations are used. As shown by Simpson [1927], by Komabayasi [1967], and by Ingersoll [1969] when the concentration of the absorbing gas in the atmosphere is temperature dependent, equilibrium is impossible for values of the solar forcing larger than a critical value. This result is referred to as a runaway greenhouse. The cumulus convection parameterization schemes currently in use in global climate models (GCMs) employ different assumptions about moistening. This causes the critical solar forcing above which a runaway greenhouse occurs to be very sensitive to the cumulus convection scheme employed. Furthermore, using the microphysically based cumulus convection scheme proposed by Emanuel [1991], we show that the sensitivity of the equilibrium temperature to changes in the solar forcing depends crucially on the microphysics of cumulus convection. For fixed cloud conditions, the critical solar forcing for a runaway greenhouse to occur is between approximately 1.22 and 1.49 times the global mean value for the Earth, and for clear sky conditions, it is a few percent lower. The runaway greenhouse in the experiments with the mass flux schemes generally occurs more rapidly than in the experiments with the adjustment schemes. In addition, the inability of the hard convective adjustment scheme to produce an efficient vertical transport of moisture, together with the saturation requirement for convection to occur, leads to the breakdown of the radiative-convective equilibria when other processes are not available to provide the necessary vertical transport of water vapor.},

The essential difference between our model and other radiative-convective models is that in our model the moisture profile (but not cloudiness) is interactively computed by the cumulus convection scheme. This has a crucial influence on the computation of the radiative fluxes throughout the atmosphere and therefore on the model's sensitivities. Using the Emanuel scheme, we show that the climate equilibrium is very sensitive to cloud microphysical processes. Clouds with high precipitation efficiency produce cold and dry climates. Clouds with low precipitation efficiency lead to moist and warm climates. Since climate equilibrium can be very sensitive to the cloud microphysical processes, any cumulus convection scheme adequate for use in general circulation models (GCMs) should be strongly based on them. The cumulus convection schemes currently in use in GCMs bypass the microphysical processes by making arbitrary moistening assumptions. We suggest that they are inadequate for climate change studies.},

In particular, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid-Pliocene Warm Period have been used in emergent constraint approaches using simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP). Despite lower uncertainties regarding geological proxy data for the LGM in comparison with the Pliocene, the robustness of the emergent constraint between LGM temperature and ECS is weaker at both global and regional scales. Here, we investigate the climate of the LGM in models through different PMIP generations, and how various factors contribute to the spread of the model ensemble. Certain factors have large impact on an emergent constraint, such as state-dependency in climate feedbacks or model-dependency on ice sheet forcing. Other factors, such as models being out of energetic balance and sea-surface temperature not responding below -1.8 \&deg;C in polar regions have a limited influence. We quantify some of the contributions and find that they mostly have extratropical origins. Contrary to what has previously been suggested, from a statistical point of view, the PMIP model generations do not differ substantially. Finally, we show that the lack of high or low ECS models in the ensembles critically limits the strength and reliability of the emergent constraints.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper describes qualitative features of the generation of jetlike concentrated circulations, wakes, and blocks by simple mountainlike orography, both from idealized laboratory experiments and shallow-water numerical simulations on a sphere. The experiments are unstratified with barotropic lee Rossby waves, and jets induced by mountain orography. A persistent pattern of lee jet formation and lee cyclogenesis owes its origins to arrested topographic Rossby waves above the mountain and potential vorticity (PV) advection through them. The wake jet occurs on the equatorward, eastern flank of the topography. A strong upstream blocking of the westerly flow occurs in a Lighthill mode of long Rossby wave propagation, which depends on {$\beta$}a2/U, the ratio of Rossby wave speed based on the scale of the mountain, to zonal advection speed, U ({$\beta$} is the meridional potential vorticity gradient, f is the Coriolis frequency, and a is the diameter of the mountain). Mountains wider (north\textendash south) than the east\textendash west length scale of stationary Rossby waves will tend to block the oncoming westerly flow. These blocks are essentially {$\beta$} plumes, which are illustrated by their linear Green function. For large {$\beta$}a2/U, upwind blocking is strong; the mountain wake can be unstable, filling the fluid with transient Rossby waves as in the numerical simulations of Polvani et al. For small values, {$\beta$}a2/U {$\ll$} 1 classic lee Rossby waves with large wavelength compared to the mountain diameter are the dominant process. The mountain height, {$\delta$}h, relative to the mean fluid depth, H, affects these transitions as well. Simple lee Rossby waves occur only for such small heights, {$\delta$}h/h {$\ll$} a{$\beta$}/f, that the f/h contours are not greatly distorted by the mountain. Nongeostrophic dynamics are seen in inertial waves generated by geostrophic shear, and ducted by it, and also in a texture of finescale, inadvertent convection. Weakly damped circulations induced in a shallow-water numerical model on a sphere by a lone mountain in an initially simple westerly wind are also described. Here, with {$\beta$}a2/U {$\sim$}1, potential vorticity stirring and transient Rossby waves dominate, and drive zonal flow acceleration. Low-latitude critical layers, when present, exert strong control on the high-latitude waves, and with no restorative damping of the mean zonal flow, they migrate poleward toward the source of waves. While these experiments with homogeneous fluid are very simplified, the baroclinic atmosphere and ocean have many tall or equivalent barotropic eddy structures owing to the barotropization process of geostrophic turbulence.},

Studies often assume that this relationship is approximately linear, but it is unclear whether the approximation always holds. Here we show that, on seasonal timescales, clear-sky OLR is a multivalued function of local surface temperature. In many places, the OLR-temperature relationship is better approximated by a loop than a line and we quantify the resulting ``OLR loopiness'', that is, how much clear-sky OLR varies between different seasons with the same surface temperature. Based on offline radiative calculations, in the tropics OLR loops are mainly caused by seasonal variations in relative humidity that are out of phase with surface temperature; in the extratropics, OLR loops are mainly due to variations in lapse rates. Our work provides a mechanism through which Earth's climate feedback can differ between seasonal and long-term time scales.},

Here, the specific question of whether there is a tipping point in the sea ice cover is investigated. The global climate model HadCM3 is used to map the trajectory of sea ice area under idealised scenarios. The atmospheric CO\textsubscript{2} is first ramped up to four times pre-industrial levels (4 \texttimes{} CO\textsubscript{2}), then ramped down to pre-industrial levels. We also examine the impact of stabilising climate at 4 \texttimes{} CO\textsubscript{2} prior to ramping CO\textsubscript{2} down to pre-industrial levels. Against global mean temperature, Arctic sea ice area is reversible, while the Antarctic sea ice shows some asymmetric behaviour \textendash{} its rate of change slower, with falling temperatures, than its rate of change with rising temperatures.

The emphasis is on the impact on the midlatitude flow downstream of the ET event. The midlatitude flow is represented by a balanced straight jet stream. As the tropical cyclone approaches the jet, a ridge\textendash trough couplet and a distinct jet streak form in the upper-level flow. A midlatitude cyclone develops rapidly downstream of the ET system and the further evolution is characterized by downstream baroclinic development. Based on Hovm\"oller diagrams, the upper-level development is interpreted as the excitation and subsequent dispersion of a Rossby wave train on the potential vorticity gradient associated with the jet. The characteristics of this wave train are sensitive to the structure of the jet and to moist processes in the midlatitudes. The tropical cyclone undergoing ET acts as a sustained forcing for the wave train and the structure of the ET system impacts the development most significantly one to two wavelengths downstream of ET. Piecewise inversion of potential vorticity, complemented by the partitioning of the flow into its rotational and divergent parts, is applied to assess the impact of the ET system quantitatively. Both the cyclonic circulation and the outflow of the tropical cyclone are important contributors to the formation and amplification of the ridge\textendash trough couplet. The outflow anomaly reduces the eastward motion of the ridge\textendash trough couplet significantly and thus promotes phase-locking between the tropical cyclone and the upper-level pattern.

Thinner ice amplifies the atmospheric temperature sensitivity in these experiments by about 15\% (to a warming of 4.8\textdegree C), because it is easier for the thinner ice to be removed as the climate warms. Thus, its impact on sensitivity is similar to that of greater sea ice extent in the control run, which provides more opportunity for sea ice reduction. An experiment with sea ice not allowed to change between the control and doubled CO2 simulations illustrates that the total effect of sea ice on surface air temperature changes, including cloud cover and water vapor feedbacks that arise in response to sea ice variations, amounts to 37\% of the temperature sensitivity to the CO2 doubling, accounting for 1.56\textdegree C of the 4.17\textdegree C global warming. This is about four times larger than the sea ice impact when no feedbacks are allowed. The different experiments produce a range of results for southern high latitudes with the hydrologic budget over Antarctica implying sea level increases of varying magnitude or no change. These results highlight the importance of properly constraining the sea ice response to climate perturbations, necessitating the use of more realistic sea ice and ocean models.},

The network provides freely available temperature and salinity data from the upper 2,000 m of the ocean with global coverage. The data are available within 24 hours of collection for use in a broad range of applications that focus on examining climate-relevant variability on seasonal to decadal timescales, multidecadal climate change, improved initialization of coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere climate models and constraining ocean analysis and forecasting systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract The role played by enhanced upper-tropospheric baroclinicity in the poleward shift of the jet streams in global warming scenarios is investigated. Major differences between the twentieth- and twenty-first-century simulations are first detailed using two coupled climate model outputs. There is a poleward shift of the eddy-driven jets, an increase in intensity and poleward shift of the storm tracks, a strengthening of the upper-tropospheric baroclinicity, and an increase in the eddy length scale. These properties are more obvious in the Southern Hemisphere. A strengthening of the poleward eddy momentum fluxes and a relative decrease in frequency of cyclonic wave breaking compared to anticyclonic wave breaking events is also observed. Then, baroclinic instability in the three-level quasigeostrophic model is studied analytically and offers a simple explanation for the increased eddy spatial scale. It is shown that if the potential vorticity gradient changes its sign below the midlevel (i.e., if the critical level is located in the lower troposphere as in the real atmosphere), long and short wavelengths become respectively more and less unstable when the upper-tropospheric baroclinicity is increased. Finally, a simple dry atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) is used to confirm the key role played by the upper-level baroclinicity by employing a normal-mode approach and long-term simulations forced by a temperature relaxation. The eddy length scale is shown to largely determine the nature of the breaking: long (short) wavelengths break more anticyclonically (cyclonically). When the upper-tropospheric baroclinicity is reinforced, long wavelengths become more unstable, break more strongly anticyclonically, and push the jet more poleward. Short wavelengths being less unstable, they are less efficient in pushing the jet equatorward. This provides an interpretation for the increased poleward eddy momentum fluxes and thus the poleward shift of the eddy-driven jets.},

This feature is largely consistent in observations from year to year and across different satellite products. The asymmetry is also broadly reproduced by comprehensive climate models across generations from CMIP3 to CMIP6, with limited impacts from internal variability. Using a range of idealized climate models of varying complexity, we show that the seasonal cycle in top-of-atmosphere incident solar radiation drives the asymmetry. Because insolation in southern high latitudes departs from a sinusoid by having a narrow peak of intense brightness in summer and a long period of low light in winter, there is rapid summer ice retreat and gradual winter ice advance. This simple physical explanation is markedly different from those proposed in previous studies.},

The physical processes driving these changes and the relative roles of external forcing versus natural variability remain under debate, partly due to lack of confidence in the simulation of Arctic sea ice by coupled climate models. Here, we nudge a widely-used CMIP5-class model (CESM1) toward observed winds above the boundary layer. These simulations reproduce observed Arctic trend patterns and Arctic-average interannual fluctuations in near-surface temperature. We find that atmospheric circulation plays a crucial role in September Arctic sea ice loss and sea ice interannual variability. Trends in the observed atmospheric circulation that are not part of the modeled forced response cause approximately 20\%\textendash 25\% of the modeled September sea ice decline, which is in close agreement with the observed trend. However, our simulations do not capture sea ice loss in other seasons, pointing to important model biases in winter and spring.},

In such simulations, mesoscale organization appears naturally, independent of the particulars of the initial condition. As the magnitude of an imposed low-level shear increases, the convection becomes increasingly organized in lines or arcs, propagating broadly downshear, as predicted by earlier work. When the shear is very strong, the convection tends to organize into lines at an angle to the shear, such that the line-normal component is not far from its theoretical optimal value. Midlevel shear favors shear-parallel lines, but if it occurs in conjunction with sufficiently strong low-level shear, the convection can become very strongly organized into lines or arcs generally orthogonal to the low-level shear. Optimal organization occurs when the depth of the shear layer is comparable to that of the cold pools associated with the convective downdrafts.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}As the vertical shear is increased, the domain-averaged convective available potential energy (CAPE) at first increases but then decreases at stronger shear values. Associated with these changes, the lower to middle troposphere becomes drier at low shear values and more humid when the shear is strong. This relationship between humidity and CAPE is broadly consistent with recently developed CAPE theories. The authors also confirm previous work that shows that the transport of momentum by the simulated convection, though usually down the gradient of the background flow, is nonlocal in character.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Finally, some simulations are performed with an imposed hodograph taken from a tropical cyclone.

The system is run into a state of statistical equilibrium for a range of imposed tropospheric radiative cooling rates. The heat budget implies that there should be a larger cloud mass flux for increasing radiative cooling; it does not exclude the possibility of more intense updrafts, but does not require it. In the numerical simulations, it is found that the increase of cloud areal coverage accounts for all the increase of the cloud mass flux required to balance an increase of the radiative cooling rate.

Surface heat flux and ocean heat content estimates are combined using a novel Kalman smoother-based method. Regional contributions from ocean heat transport convergences are inferred as a residual and the dominant drivers of Hmld and Htot are quantified for seasonal and interannual time scales. We find that non-Ekman ocean heat transport processes dominate Hmld variations in the equatorial oceans and regions of strong ocean currents and substantial eddy activity. In these locations, surface temperature anomalies generated by ocean dynamics result in turbulent flux anomalies that drive the overlying atmosphere. In addition, we find large regions of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans where heat transports combine with local air-sea fluxes to generate mixed layer temperature anomalies. In all locations, except regions of deep convection and water mass transformation, interannual variations in Htot are dominated by the internal rearrangement of heat by ocean dynamics rather than the loss or addition of heat at the surface. Our analysis suggests that, even in extratropical latitudes, initialization of ocean dynamical processes could be an important source of skill for interannual predictability of Hmld and Htot. Furthermore, we expect variations in Htot (and thus thermosteric sea level) to be more predictable than near surface temperature anomalies due to the increased importance of ocean heat transport processes for full-depth heat budgets.},

  abstract = {Abstract Current prediction of snowfall amounts is accomplished either by using empirical techniques or by using a standard modification of liquid equivalent precipitation such as the 10-to-1 rule. This rule, which supposes that the depth of the snowfall is 10 times the liquid equivalent (a snow ratio of 10:1, reflecting an assumed snow density of 100 kg m-3), is a particularly popular technique with operational forecasters, although it dates from a limited nineteenth-century study. Unfortunately, measurements of freshly fallen snow indicate that the snow ratio can vary from on the order of 3:1 to (occasionally) 100:1. Improving quantitative snowfall forecasts requires, in addition to solutions to the significant challenge of forecasting liquid precipitation amounts, a more robust method for forecasting the density of snow. A review of the microphysical literature reveals that many factors may contribute to snow density, including in-cloud (crystal habit and size, the degree of riming and aggregation of the snowflake), subcloud (melting and sublimation), and surface processes (compaction and snowpack metamorphism). Despite this complexity, the paper explores the sufficiency of surface and radiosonde data for the classification of snowfall density. A principal component analysis isolates seven factors that influence the snow ratio: solar radiation (month), low- to midlevel temperature, mid- to upper-level temperature, low- to midlevel relative humidity, midlevel relative humidity, upper-level relative humidity, and external compaction (surface wind speed and liquid equivalent). A 10-member ensemble of artificial neural networks is employed to explore the capability of determining snow ratio in one of three classes: heavy (1:1 {$<$} ratio {$<$} 9:1), average (9:1 {$\leq$} ratio {$\leq$} 15:1), and light (ratio {$>$} 15:1). The ensemble correctly diagnoses 60.4\% of the cases, which is a substantial improvement over the 41.7\% correct using the sample climatology, 45.0\% correct using the 10-to-1 ratio, and 51.7\% correct using the National Weather Service ``new snowfall to estimated meltwater conversion'' table. A key skill measure, the Heidke skill score, attains values of 0.34\textendash 0.42 using the ensemble technique, with increases of 75\%\textendash 183\% over the next most skillful approach. The critical success index shows that the ensemble technique provides the best information for all three snow-ratio classes. The most critical inputs to the ensemble are related to the month, temperature, and external compaction. Withholding relative humidity information from the neural networks leads to a loss of performance of at least 5\% in percent correct, suggesting that these inputs are useful, if nonessential. Examples of pairs of cases highlight the influence that these factors have in determining snow ratio. Given the improvement over presently used techniques for diagnosing snow ratio, this study indicates that the neural network approach can lead to advances in forecasting snowfall depth.},

  abstract = {The impact of melt ponds on Arctic sea ice is estimated from model simulations of the historical and future climate. The simulations were performed with and without the effect of melt ponds on sea ice melt, respectively. In the last thirty years of the historical simulations, melt ponds develop predominantly in the continental shelf regions and in the Canadian archipelago. Accordingly, the ice albedo in these regions is systematically smaller than in the no-pond simulations, the sea ice melt is enhanced, and both the ice concentration and ice thickness during the September minimum are reduced. Open ponds decrease the ice albedo, resulting in enhanced ice melt, less sea ice and further pond growth. This positive feedback entails a more realistic representation of the seasonal cycle of Northern Hemisphere sea ice area. Under the premise that the observed decline of Arctic sea ice over the period of modern satellite observations is mainly externally driven and, therefore, potentially predictable, both model versions underestimate the decline in Arctic sea ice. This presupposition, however, is challenged by our model simulations which show a distinct modulation of the downward Arctic sea ice trends by multidecadal variability. At longer time scales, an impact of pond activation on Arctic sea ice trends is more evident: In the Representative Concentration Pathway scenario RCP45, the September sea ice is projected to vanish by the end of the 21st century. In the active-pond simulation, this happens up to two decades earlier than in the no-pond simulations.},

  abstract = {Abstract The most recent version of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology atmospheric general circulation model, ECHAM5, is used to study the impact of changes in horizontal and vertical resolution on seasonal mean climate. In a series of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-style experiments with resolutions ranging between T21L19 and T159L31, the systematic errors and convergence properties are assessed for two vertical resolutions. At low vertical resolution (L19) there is no evidence for convergence to a more realistic climate state for horizontal resolutions higher than T42. At higher vertical resolution (L31), on the other hand, the root-mean-square errors decrease monotonically with increasing horizontal resolution. Furthermore, except for T42, the L31 versions are superior to their L19 counterparts, and the improvements become more evident at increasingly higher horizontal resolutions. This applies, in particular, to the zonal mean climate state and to the stationary wave patterns in boreal winter. As in previous studies, increasing horizontal resolution leads to a warming of the troposphere, most prominently at midlatitudes, and to a poleward shift and intensification of the midlatitude westerlies. Increasing the vertical resolution has the opposite effect, almost independent of horizontal resolution. Whereas the atmosphere is colder at low and middle latitudes, it is warmer at high latitudes and close to the surface. In addition, increased vertical resolution results in a pronounced warming in the polar upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, where the cold bias is reduced by up to 50\% compared to L19 simulations. Consistent with these temperature changes is a decrease and equatorward shift of the midlatitude westerlies. The substantial benefits in refining both horizontal and vertical resolution give some support to scaling arguments deduced from quasigeostrophic theory implying that horizontal and vertical resolution ought to be chosen consistently.},

The nonlinearity of climate feedbacks is calculated from a range of studies and is shown also to have very little impact on the asymmetry. The intrinsic relationship between uncertainties in the observed climate forcing and the climate's radiative response to that forcing (i.e., the feedbacks) is emphasized. We also demonstrate that because the pdf of climate forcing is approximately symmetric, there is a strong expectation that the pdf of climate feedbacks should be symmetric as well.},

The analysis can also be used to illustrate some fundamental properties of climate feedbacks: how feedback strength changes as a function of mean climate state; how small changes in individual feedbacks can cause large changes in the system sensitivity; and last, how the strength and even the sign of the feedback is dependent on the climate variable in question.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Recent studies have suggested that simple mathematical models incorporating a radiative response which is related to upper- and deep-ocean disequilibrium (ocean heat uptake efficacy), inhomogeneous patterns of surface warming and radiative feedbacks (pattern effect), or an explicit dependence of the strength of radiative feedbacks on surface temperature change (feedback temperature dependence) may explain the climate response in atmosphere-ocean coupled general circulation models (AOGCMs) or can be useful for interpreting the instrumental record. We analyze a two-layer model with an ocean heat transport efficacy, a two-region model with region specific heat capacities and radiative responses; a one-layer model with a temperature dependent feedback; and a model which combines elements of the two-layer/region models and the state-dependent feedback parameter. We show that, from the perspective of the globally averaged surface temperature and radiative imbalance, the two-region and two-layer models are equivalent. State-dependence of the feedback parameter introduces a nonlinearity in the system which makes the adjustment timescales forcing-dependent. Neither the linear two-region/layer models, nor the state-dependent feedback model adequately describes the behavior of complex climate models. The model which combines elements of both can adequately describe the response of more comprehensive models but may require more experimental input than is available from single forcing realizations.},

Present-to-future multimodel mean changes in storm risk are analyzed, with special attention to robust patterns (in terms of consensus among individual models) and privileging in each case the subset of models exhibiting the highest agreement with the results yielded by two reanalyses. A reduction of about 10\%\textendash 15\% in the overall frequency of NA polar lows that would uniformly affect the full spectrum of storm intensities is expected. In addition, a very robust regional redistribution of cases is obtained, namely a tendency to shift part of the polar low activity from the south Greenland\textendash Icelandic sector toward the Nordic seas closer to Scandinavia. In contrast, the future change in the number of medicanes is unclear (on average the total frequency of storms does not vary), but a profound reshaping of the spectrum of lifetime maximum winds is found; the results project a higher number of moderate and violent medicanes at the expense of weak storms. Spatially, the method projects an increased occurrence of medicanes in the western Mediterranean and Black Sea that is balanced by a reduction of storm tracks in contiguous areas, particularly in the central Mediterranean; however, future extreme events (winds \&gt; 60 kt; 1 kt = 0.51 m s\textsuperscript{-1}) become more probable in all Mediterranean subbasins.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This theory is constructed for radiative\textendash convective equilibrium and compared against a cloud-resolving model. With some reinterpretation of variables, it can be applied more generally to the entire tropics.             Given four variables\textemdash pressure, temperature, and the fractional entrainment and detrainment rates\textemdash the equations predict the relative humidity (RH) and the temperature lapse rate analytically. The RH is a simple ratio involving the fractional detrainment rate and the water-vapor lapse rate. When integrated upward in height, the equations give profiles of RH and temperature for a convecting atmosphere.             The theory explains the magnitude of RH and the ``C'' shape of the tropospheric RH profile. It also predicts that RH is an invariant function of temperature as the atmosphere warms, and this behavior matches what has been seen in global climate models and what is demonstrated here with cloud-resolving simulations. Extending the theory to include the evaporation of hydrometeors, a lower bound is derived for the precipitation efficiency (PE) at each height: PE \&gt; 1 - RH. In a cloud-resolving simulation, this constraint is obeyed with the PE profile taking the shape of an inverted C shape.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The entropy budget has been a popular starting point for theories of the work, or dissipation, performed by moist atmospheres. For a dry atmosphere, the entropy budget provides a theory for the dissipation in terms of the imposed diabatic heat sources. For a moist atmosphere, the difficulties in quantifying irreversible moist processes or the value of the condensation temperature have so far frustrated efforts to construct a theory of dissipation. With this complication in mind, one of the goals here is to investigate the predictive power of the budget of dry entropy (i.e., the heat capacity times the logarithm of potential temperature).             Toward this end, the dry-entropy budget is derived for an atmosphere with realistic heat capacities and a solid-water phase, features that were absent from some previous studies of atmospheric entropy. It is shown that the dry-entropy budget may be interpreted as the sum of sources and sinks from six processes, which are, in order of decreasing magnitude, radiative cooling, condensation heating, sensible heating at the surface, wind-generated frictional dissipation, lifting of water, and transport of heat from the melting line to the upper troposphere. This picture leads to an alternative explanation for the low efficiency of the moist atmospheric engine.             Numerical simulations are presented from a new cloud-resolving model, Das Atmosph\"arische Modell, which was designed to conserve energy and close the dry-entropy budget. Simulations with and without subgrid diffusion of heat and water are compared to investigate the impact of subgrid parameterizations on the terms in the dry-entropy budget. The numerical results suggest a particularly simple parameterization of wind-generated dissipation that appears to be valid for changes in sea surface temperature and mean wind. The dry-entropy budget also points to various changes in forcings and parameterizations that could be expected to increase or decrease the wind-generated dissipation.},

Unlike previous analytic expressions, some of which can have errors as high as hundreds or thousands of meters, this exact expression is accurate to within the uncertainty of empirical vapor pressure measurements: this translates into an uncertainty of around 5 m for all temperatures and relative humidities. An exact, explicit, analytic expression for the lifting deposition level (LDL) is also derived, and its behavior is compared to the LCL. At sufficiently cold temperatures, aerosols freeze homogeneously below the LCL; an approximate, implicit, analytic expression is given for this lifting freezing level (LFL). By comparing the LCL, LDL, and LFL, it is found that a well-mixed boundary layer can have an ice-supersaturated layer that is no thicker than 400 m.},

There are many properties of convection that can change as the atmosphere warms, each of which could produce deviations from CC scaling.

Convection in the cloud-resolving simulations is found to change as predicted by this theory, leading to an {$\sim$}20\% increase in local precipitation fluxes when the CO2 concentration is doubled.

Using a streamfunction to define natural boundaries for these thermals, the dominant balance in the vertical momentum equation is revealed. Cloud thermals rise with a nearly constant speed determined by their buoyancy and the standard drag law with a drag coefficient of 0.6. Contrary to suggestions that cloud thermals might be slippery, with a dominant balance between buoyancy and acceleration, cloud thermals are found here to be sticky, with a dominant balance between buoyancy and drag.},

It is found that the convective flux of undiluted parcels decays with height exponentially, indicating a constant probability per vertical distance of mixing with environmental air. This probability per distance is sufficiently large that undiluted updrafts are negligible above a height of 4\textendash 5 km and virtually absent above 10 km. These results are shown to be independent of the horizontal grid size within the range of 3.2 km to 100 m. Plumes that do reach the tropopause are found to be highly diluted.             An equivalent potential temperature is defined that is exactly conserved for all reversible adiabatic transformations, including those with ice. Using this conserved variable, it is shown that the latent heat of fusion (from both freezing and deposition) causes only a small increase in the level of neutral buoyancy near the tropopause. In fact, when taken to sufficiently low pressures, a parcel with an ice phase ends up colder than it would without an ice phase. Nevertheless, the contribution from fusion to a parcel's kinetic energy is quite large.             Using an ensemble of tracers, information is encoded in parcels at the cloud base and decoded where the parcel is observed in the free troposphere. Using this technique, clouds at the tropopause are diagnosed for their cloud-base temperature, specific humidity, and vertical velocity. Using these as the initial values for a Lagrangian parcel model, it is shown that fusion provides the kinetic energy required for diluted parcels to reach the tropopause.},

It is found that neither method is able to capture the two different time scales present in the full 3D equations. Nevertheless, WPG is argued to have several advantages over WTG. First, WPG correctly predicts the magnitude of the steady-state buoyancy anomalies generated by an applied heating, but WTG underestimates these buoyancy anomalies. It is conjectured that this underestimation may short-circuit the natural feedbacks between convective mass fluxes and local temperature anomalies. Second, WPG correctly predicts the adiabatic lifting of air below an initial buoyancy perturbation; WTG is unable to capture this nonlocal effect. It is hypothesized that this may be relevant to moist convection, where adiabatic lifting can reduce convective inhibition. Third, WPG agrees with the full 3D equations on the counterintuitive fact that an isolated heating applied to a column of Boussinesq fluid leads to a steady ascent with zero column-integrated buoyancy. This falsifies the premise of the relaxed form of WTG, which assumes that vertical velocity is proportional to buoyancy.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations and numerical model simulations associate rising motions below the right-entrance and left-exit quadrants of an upper-level straight jet streak with the development of convection and severe weather. The occurrence of tornadoes in relation to the jet quadrants is investigated for the continental United States for the spring months of 1990\textendash 99. Tornadoes occurred primarily within the two exit quadrants, with the left-exit quadrant favored over the right-exit quadrant. While fewer tornadoes were located below the two entrance quadrants, the right-entrance quadrant was favored over the left-entrance quadrant. For those days on which many tornadoes occurred (``outbreak'' days), a greater percentage of tornadoes occurred below the left-exit and right-entrance quadrants than for those days on which only a few tornadoes were reported. Composite diagrams are presented to clarify the relationship between the quadrants of a jet streak, severe weather, and synoptic features such as low pressure centers and frontal boundaries.},

Simple heat sinks are prescribed in shallow aquaplanet ocean mixed layers underlying atmospheric general circulation models independently and combined with CO2 forcing. Sinks are localized to either tropical or high latitudes, representing distinct modes of OHU found in coupled simulations. Tropical OHU produces modest cooling at all latitudes, offsetting only a fraction of CO2 warming. High-latitude OHU produces three times more global mean cooling in a strongly polar-amplified pattern. Global sensitivities in each scenario are set primarily by large differences in local shortwave cloud feedbacks, robust across models. Differences in atmospheric energy transport set the pattern of temperature change. Results imply that global and regional warming rates depend sensitively on regional ocean processes setting the OHU pattern, and that equilibrium climate sensitivity cannot be reliably estimated from transient observations.},

The interdependence of radiative and ocean heat uptake processes governing this increase are reviewed. Heat uptake tends to be spatially localized to the subpolar oceans, and this pattern emerges rapidly from an initially uniform distribution. Global climatic impact of heat uptake is studied through the lens of the efficacy concept and a linear systems perspective in which responses to individual climate forcing agents are additive. Heat uptake can be treated as a slowly varying forcing on the atmosphere and surface, whose efficacy is strongly determined by its geographical pattern. An illustrative linear model driven by simple prescribed uptake patterns demonstrates the emergence of increasing climate sensitivity as a consequence of the slow decay of high-efficacy subpolar heat uptake. Evidence is reviewed for the key role of shortwave cloud feedbacks in setting the high efficacy of ocean heat uptake and thus in increasing climate sensitivity. A causal physical mechanism is proposed, linking subpolar heat uptake to a global-scale increase in lower-tropospheric stability. It is shown that the rate of increase in estimated inversion strength systematically slows as heat uptake decays. Variations in heat uptake should therefore manifest themselves as differences in low cloud feedbacks.},

Stable partial snow and ice cover on such a planet would be in the form of a belt about the equator rather than polar caps. An analytical model of planetary climate is used to investigate the stability of ice caps and ice belts over the widest possible range of parameters. The model is a non-dimensional diffusive Energy Balance Model, representing insolation, heat transport, and ice-albedo feedback on a spherical planet. A complete analytical solution for any obliquity is given and validated against numerical solutions of a seasonal model in the ``deep-water'' regime of weak seasonal ice line migration. Multiple equilibria and unstable transitions between climate states (ice-free, Snowball, or ice cap/belt) are found over wide swaths of parameter space, including a ``Large Ice-Belt Instability'' and ``Small Ice-Belt Instability'' at high obliquity. The Snowball catastrophe is avoided at weak radiative forcing in two different scenarios: weak albedo feedback and inefficient heat transport (favoring stable partial ice cover), or efficient transport at high obliquity (favoring ice-free conditions). From speculative assumptions about distributions of planetary parameters, three-fourths to four-fifths of all planets with stable partial ice cover should be in the form of Earth-like polar caps.},

  abstract = {Abstract The downward trend in Arctic sea ice extent is one of the most dramatic signals of climate change during recent decades. Comprehensive climate models have struggled to reproduce this trend, typically simulating a slower rate of sea ice retreat than has been observed. However, this bias has been widely noted to have decreased in models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) compared with the previous generation of models (CMIP3). Here simulations are examined from both CMIP3 and CMIP5. It is found that simulated historical sea ice trends are influenced by volcanic forcing, which was included in all of the CMIP5 models but in only about half of the CMIP3 models. The volcanic forcing causes temporary simulated cooling in the 1980s and 1990s, which contributes to raising the simulated 1979\textendash 2013 global-mean surface temperature trends to values substantially larger than observed. It is shown that this warming bias is accompanied by an enhanced rate of Arctic sea ice retreat and hence a simulated sea ice trend that is closer to the observed value, which is consistent with previous findings of an approximately linear relationship between sea ice extent and global-mean surface temperature. Both generations of climate models are found to simulate Arctic sea ice that is substantially less sensitive to global warming than has been observed. The results imply that much of the difference in Arctic sea ice trends between CMIP3 and CMIP5 occurred because of the inclusion of volcanic forcing, rather than improved sea ice physics or model resolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observations indicate that the Arctic sea ice cover is rapidly retreating while the Antarctic sea ice cover is steadily expanding. State-of-the-art climate models, by contrast, typically simulate a moderate decrease in both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice covers. However, in each hemisphere there is a small subset of model simulations that have sea ice trends similar to the observations. Based on this, a number of recent studies have suggested that the models are consistent with the observations in each hemisphere when simulated internal climate variability is taken into account. Here sea ice changes during 1979\textendash 2013 are examined in simulations from the most recent Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) as well as the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), drawing on previous work that found a close relationship in climate models between global-mean surface temperature and sea ice extent. All of the simulations with 1979\textendash 2013 Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observations are found to have considerably more global warming than observations during this time period. Using two separate methods to estimate the sea ice retreat that would occur under the observed level of global warming in each simulation in both ensembles, it is found that simulated Arctic sea ice retreat as fast as observations would occur less than 1\% of the time. This implies that the models are not consistent with the observations. In the Antarctic, simulated sea ice expansion as fast as observations is found to typically correspond with too little global warming, although these results are more equivocal. As a result, the simulations do not capture the observed asymmetry between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice trends. This suggests that the models may be getting the right sea ice trends for the wrong reasons in both polar regions.},

Whereas the emphasis in most previous studies with these models has been placed on the temperature and precipitation changes expected from a doubled-CO2 scenario, the intent here is to investigate some of the dynamical consequences predicted by them models, especially within the tropics where the zonal-wind and temperature changes are less tightly coupled than elsewhere. Comparisons among the three models of the difference in zonal-mean zonal winds between 2\texttimes C02 and 1\texttimes C02 simulations indicate a common tendency when C02 is doubled for winds to become more easterly in much of the tropics during June-July-August. Less of a consensus for the tropics emerges for December-January-February, perhaps as a result of differences among the models' basic climatologies for the zonal-wind field. In general, however, changes predicted for the zonal winds in the tropics and elsewhere are comparable to the interannual variability currently observed, suggesting that these changes ought to become detectable eventually. Largely because of the tropical wind changes, decreases in the troposphere's relative angular momentum accompany a doubling of C02 in all the model runs. The amplitude of the decrease is typically a considerable fraction of a model's seasonal cycle and, in some cases, is large enough that a measurable change in the length of day could result. Although the possibility of an anthropogenic effect on earth's rotation is noteworthy, such a prediction must be regarded as tentative in light of the shortcomings found in the models' zonal-wind climatologies and the differences in their zonal-mean responses.},

The simulations span a wide range of warming and moistening patterns due to the spatial structures of the imposed OHU. Fractional changes in Q per degree of surface warming range from 0\% to 20\% K-1 locally and from 3.6\% to 11\% K-1 globally. A new diagnostic technique decomposes these changes into relative humidity (RH), surface temperature, and lapse rate contributions. Single-column calculations demonstrate substantial departures from apparent (surface temperature based) Clausius\textendash Clapeyron (CC) scaling due to lapse rates changes; a moist-adiabatic column with fixed, uniform RH exceeds the CC rate by 2.5\% K-1. The RH contribution is very small in most simulations. The various Q scalings are thus all consistent CC, but result from different patterns of polar amplification and lapse rate change. Lapse rates are sensitive to location and magnitude of OHU, with implications for Q under transient climate change. CO2 with subpolar (tropical) OHU results in higher (lower) Q scalings than CO2 alone. The weakest Q scaling (and largest RH effects) is found for increased poleward ocean heat transport, which causes strongly polar-amplified warming and near-zero tropical temperature change. Despite weak RH changes and fidelity to the CC relation, Q is expected to vary widely on different time scales in nature due to sensitivity of lapse rates to OHU along with the nonlinearity of the diagnostics.},

This science has recognized that the exact characterof the forces controlling the motion of a turbulent fluid is not known and thatconsequently there is very little justification for a purely theoretical attack on problems of a practical character. For this reason fluid mechanics has been forced to develop a research technique all of its own, in which the theory is developed on the basis of experiments and then used to predict the behavior of fluids in cases which are not accessibleto experimentation. In oceanography it has long been regarded as an axiom that the movements of thewater are controlled by three forces, the horizontal pressure gradient, the deflecting force,and the frictional force resulting from the relative motion of superimposed strata. It issignificant that thirty-five years of intensive theoretical work on this basis have failedto produce a theory capable of explaining the major features of the observed oceaniccirculation below the pure drift current layer. The present investigation considers a force which has been completely disregardedby theoretical investigators although its existence has been admitted implicitly bypractically everyone who has approached physical oceanography from the descriptiveside, namely the frictional force resulting from large-scale horizontal mixing. The intro-. duction of this force permits us to see how motion generated in the surface layers may bediffused and finally dissipated without recourse to doubtful frictional forces at the bottomof the ocean.}

  abstract = {Abstract In this paper the energy and frequency propagation in certain types of plane waves in the atmosphere and in the ocean are investigated, these wave trains being characterized by the property that frequency and wave number are slowly varying functions of the space coordinate and time. The assumption is made that wave crests are conserved, and on this basis a simple kinematic relationship between frequency and wave number is established. Wave trains for which the physical theory results in a frequency equation of such a character that phase velocity and wave length uniquely determine each other are then found to possess a characteristic group velocity, and it is shown that frequencies (and hence group velocities) are propagated with this characteristic group velocity. In the more general case the frequency equation resulting from the physical theory is found to contain a correction term which is an explicit function of the space coordinate and time. In that case observers travelling with the conventionally defined group velocity (obtained by disregarding the correction term) will observe gradual changes in frequency, but it is shown that these changes, at least in the wave types here investigated, are insignificant except in the leading and trailing boundaries of the wave trains. Energy propagation equations are derived for three different types of wave motion. It is found that the relative flow of energy across planes which move with the conventionally defined group velocity (hereafter referred to as group-velocity planes), is nondivergent in those regions where the frequencies associated with individual group velocity planes remain constant. The particular limited wave trains analyzed in this paper possess the property that the boundary regions of the wave trains, where frequencies no longer are conserved, serve as sources and sinks for the energy. These results indicate that the classical energy propagation equation, which is found to be valid in the central portion of the wave trains, must not be interpreted to mean that energy is propagated with group velocity, but rather that the energy transport relative to the group-velocity planes is nondivergent. This conclusion is verified through a computation of the accumulation of energy in the extreme forerunner of a train of surface waves in deep water. The main portion of this wave train is characterized by a non-divergent relative flux of energy across the group-velocity planes. It is shown that the equations which determine the propagation of group-velocity and the nondivergent propagation of energy together form a closed system, the form of which is independent of the special dynamic characteristics of the wave train under consideration. If the distributions of energy and group velocity for one particular time are known, it is possible to compute the distribution of these elements for any subsequent time, provided the relative flux of energy remains nondivergent. As a test of the theory for frequency and energy propagation developed in this paper, exact solutions are given for the train of long gravitational waves following a limited progressive perturbation in a sheet of water on a rotating disc and for a spreading ``forerunner'' wave train of horizontal, plane, nondivergent shear waves generated by a limited progressive perturbation in the belt of west winds in middle latitudes. These exact solutions are compared with indications furnished by energy and group-velocity considerations. The analysis of wave trains in the westerlies suggests a simple explanation for the rapid-moving isallobaric waves which seem to emanate from the principal cyclonic centers of action in the Northern Hemisphere. Such isallobaric waves normally spread quite rapidly eastward, at the same time losing their intensity, and breaking up into ever more irregular patterns. These observed characteristics appear to be in good accord with the characteristics of theoretical ``forerunner'' wave trains obtained from the theoretical analysis of waves in the westerlies. It is finally suggested that the well-known retrograde ``blocking'' action observed in the west wind belt of middle latitudes might be interpreted as the effect of a convergent distribution of the group velocity in the long, quasistationary waves in the westerlies.},

A brief report on this work was published in October 1930. It was thenshown that by plotting against each other two meteorological elements, which undercertain well defined conditions are recognized as conservative, namely, specific humidityand potential temperature, curves are obtained which, in winter time, to a high extentremain unchanged and characteristic of the individual air masses. In view of this propertythe curves were named "invariant curves." Since the invariance is restricted to thewinter season, but the curves always may be advantageously used to determine the verticalstructure and life history of air masses, they shall, in the following, be referred to as"characteristic curves."The report also stated that by means of characteristic curves a new method hadbeen created of indicating certain differences in stability between the principal Americanair masses. These differences may be expressed in terms of the variation with elevationof specific entropy, and it was therefore decided to continue the investigation and toinclude in it a study of the equivalent-potential temperature, which, in an easily comprehensibleform, measures the specific entropy of moist air. The excellent results obtainedby Robitzsch through the introduction of equivalent-potential temperature into practicalmeteorological work lent additional support to this decision.}

As a first step a search is made for the factors which might give rise to the striking vertical concentration of momentum observed in many well-defined atmospheric and oceanic jet streams. A straight, parallel, heteorogeneous and incompressible current with a free surface, hydrostatic pressure distribution and a continuous density field is analyzed theoretically to determine the particular distribution of velocity with depth which, for a prescribed volume transport within each isopycnic layer, leads to a minimum value for the transfer of momentum. This requirement leads to a certain ``critical'' relationship between the velocity and density distribution which in the case of a two-layer system reduces to the well-known critical relative speed at an internal fluid boundary. In the general case of a continuous density distribution it is found that currents which are subjected to momentum losses and hence tend to approach the ``critical'' velocity distribution in many cases must shrink vertically and develop a sharp velocity maximum at or below the free surface. The nature of the structural changes to be anticipated depends ultimately upon the numerical value of a certain ``internal'' Froude Number which is a function of the initial velocity distribution as well as of the total density range.},

Although trends in jet waviness are still under discussion, it is crucial to better understand the mechanisms through which jet waviness affects weather extremes. Here we show that variations in jet waviness on regional scales effectively modulate the occurrence of daily weather extremes but in regionally different ways. The jet waviness over the North Atlantic and the North Pacific mainly affects where wind, precipitation and cold extremes occur, while a wavy jet over Eurasia strongly favors the occurrence of hot extremes in summer. This is because regional variations of jet waviness are intrinsically linked to the occurrence and tracks of synoptic-scale weather systems, which can trigger the extremes. We conclude that potential jet waviness changes would affect the occurrence of weather extremes differently depending on where these changes occur.},

  abstract = {Abstract In Part I of this study an analytical model for a steady-state tropical cyclone is constructed on the assumption that boundary-layer air parcels are conditionally neutral to displacements along the angular momentum surfaces of the hurricane vortex. The reversible thermodynamics implied by this assumption allows the mature storm to be thought of as a simple Carnot engine, acquiring heat at the high-temperature ocean surface and losing heat near the low-temperature tropopause. Although the oceanic heat source is universally recognized as the sine qua non for the mature hurricane, there is also wide acceptance of conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) (which makes no specific reference to surface heat fluxes) as the formative mechanism. This ambivalence is seen in that all numerical-simulation studies find it essential to have transfer from the ocean surface yet all start from a conditionally unstable atmosphere. The hypothesis put forward in Part I, based on the steady-state theory, is that the truly important thermodynamic interaction, even in the developing star, is between vortex and ocean (as distinct from vortex and convection sustained by preexisting conditional instability as in the CISK theory) with cumulus convection rapidly redistributing heat acquired at the oceanic source upward and outward to the upper tropospheric sink. On this view, it is not the organization of convection that is needed per se, but the organization of surface heat flux. We have constructed a time-dependent nonhydrostatic axisymmetric numerical model with convection explicitly accounted for to examine this idea. The numerical experiments show that as a result of a finite-amplitude air-sea interaction instability a hurricane-like vortex may indeed amplify in an atmosphere which is neutral to cumulus convection and attain an intensity and structure which are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions of Part I. We examine in detail the model's heat budget which confirms the crucial importance of boundary-layer processes in controlling the structure and evolution of the vortex. We also confirm the conjecture made in Part I that, within a large-scale limit, the horizontal size of the mature tropical cyclone is determined by that of the initial disturbance.},

The formula, PI+2 = EPI2 + {$\alpha$}rmwm{$\eta$}m, where EPI is the maximum potential intensity of the gradient wind and {$\alpha$}rmwm{$\eta$}m represents the supergradient winds. The latter term is the product of the radius rm, the vertical velocity wm, the azimuthal vorticity {$\eta$}m at the radius and height of the maximum tangential wind (rm, zm) and the (nearly constant) {$\alpha$}. Examination of a series of simulations of idealized tropical cyclones indicate an increasing contribution from the supergradient-wind term to PI+ as the radius of maximum wind increases. In the present paper, the physical content of the supergradient-wind term is developed showing how it is directly related to tropical-cyclone boundary-layer dynamics. It is found that rmwm{$\eta$}m {$\propto$} u2minZm(rm)/lv(zm) {$\propto$} rm where -umin is the maximum boundary-layer radial inflow velocity and lv(z) is the vertical mixing length.},

  abstract = {Abstract We study herein the mechanics of long-lived, line-oriented, precipitating cumulus convection (squall lines) using two- and three-dimensional numerical models of moist convection. These models, used in juxtaposition, enable us to address the important theoretical issue of whether a squall line is a system of special, long-lived cells, or whether it is a long-lived system of ordinary, short-lived cells. Our review of the observational literature indicates that the latter is the most consistent paradigm for the vast majority of cases but, on occasion, a squall line may be composed of essentially steady, supercell thunderstorms. The numerical experiments presented herein show that either type of squall line may develop from an initial line-like disturbance depending on the magnitude and orientation of the environmental shear with respect to the line. With shallow shear, oriented perpendicular to the line, a long-lived line evolves containing individually short-lived cells. Our analysis of this type of simulated squall line suggests that the interaction of a storm cell's cold surface. outflow with the low-level shear produces much-deeper and less-inhibited lifting than is possible without the low-level shear, making it easier for new cells to form and grow as old cells decay. Through interecomparsion of two- and three-dimensional squall-line simulations, we conclude that the essential physics of this type of squall line is contained in the two- dimensional framework. We argue that these results describe the physics of both midlatitude and tropical squall lines. Under conditions of deep strong shear at an angle to the supposed line, a line of supercells develops in which their respective three-dimensional circulations do not interfere with one another.},

We quantify the evolution of the gradient and of mid-latitude moisture both in a new compilation of Holocene palaeoclimate records spanning from 10\textdegree ~S to 90\textdegree ~N and in an ensemble of mid-Holocene climate model simulations. The observed pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that a weaker temperature gradient led to weaker mid-latitude westerly flow, weaker cyclones and decreased net terrestrial mid-latitude precipitation. Currently, the northern high latitudes are warming at rates nearly double the global average4, decreasing the Equator-to-pole temperature gradient to values comparable with those in the early to middle Holocene. If the patterns observed during the Holocene hold for current anthropogenically forced warming, the weaker latitudinal temperature gradient will lead to considerable reductions in mid-latitude water resources.},

CMIP6 provides a unique opportunity to facilitate a two-way dialog between climate modelers and VIACS experts who are looking to apply CMIP6 results for a wide array of research and climate services objectives. The VIACS Advisory Board convenes leaders of major impact sectors, international programs, and climate services to solicit community feedback that increases the applications relevance of the CMIP6-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs). As an illustration of its potential, the VIACS community provided CMIP6 leadership with a list of prioritized climate model variables and MIP experiments of the greatest interest to the climate model applications community, indicating the applicability and societal relevance of climate model simulation outputs. The VIACS Advisory Board also recommended an impacts version of Obs4MIPs and indicated user needs for the gridding and processing of model output.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The industrial view holds that most significant impacts have occurred since the early industrial era ({$\sim$}1850), whereas the early-anthropogenic view recognizes large impacts thousands of years earlier. This review focuses on three indices of global-scale human influence: forest clearance (and related land use), emissions of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4), and effects on global temperature. Because reliable, systematic land-use surveys are rare prior to 1950, most reconstructions for early-industrial centuries and prior millennia are hind casts that assume humans have used roughly the same amount of land per person for 7,000 years. But this assumption is incorrect. Historical data and new archeological databases reveal much greater per-capita land use in preindustrial than in recent centuries. This early forest clearance caused much greater preindustrial greenhouse-gas emissions and global temperature changes than those proposed within the industrial paradigm.},

Standard model simulations are generally only a few hundred years long. However, modeling the long-term equilibration in response to radiative forcing perturbation is important for understanding many climate phenomena, such as the evolution of ocean circulation, time- and temperature-dependent feedbacks, and the differentiation of forced signal and internal variability. The aim of LongRunMIP is to facilitate research into these questions by serving as an archive for simulations that capture as much of this equilibration as possible. The only requirement to participate in LongRunMIP is to contribute a simulation with elevated, constant CO2 forcing that lasts at least 1,000 years. LongRunMIP is an MIP of opportunity in that the simulations were mostly performed prior to the conception of the archive without an agreed-upon set of experiments. For most models, the archive contains a preindustrial control simulation and simulations with an idealized (typically abrupt) CO2 forcing. We collect 2D surface and top-of-atmosphere fields and 3D ocean temperature and salinity fields. Here, we document the collection of simulations and discuss initial results, including the evolution of surface and deep ocean temperature and cloud radiative effects. As of October 2019, the collection includes 50 simulations of 15 models by 10 modeling centers. The data of LongRunMIP are publicly available. We encourage submissions of more simulations in the future.},

This study investigates the evolution of large-scale temperature inversions (between 925~hPa and 2~m) in the context of a changing climate. To this end, two five-member regional climate model (RCM) ensembles, driven by the Canadian Earth System Model, spanning the 1950\textendash 2099 period, corresponding to two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), are considered. An ERA-Interim driven simulation for the 1979\textendash 2005 period is also considered to assess model performance. A comparison of observed atmospheric soundings with the boundary layer variations in the reanalysis-driven simulation indicates that the model captures the temperature inversion characteristics reasonably well, with some positive biases in the temperature inversion strength and frequency. The transient regional climate change simulations suggest substantial decreases in both temperature inversion strength and frequency in winter in future climate for both emission scenarios. These changes are consistent with the reduced sea ice cover and the associated increase in cloud cover that reduce the surface radiative cooling necessary for the formation of strong temperature inversions. Some increases in the frequency and strength of temperature inversions are projected for summer over the Arctic Ocean, possibly linked with increased poleward moisture transport.},

From 8 to 32 times, the 1950 CO2, climate sensitivity for doubling CO2 reaches 8\textdegree C due to increases in water vapor absorption and cloud top height and to reductions in low level cloud cover. As CO2 amount increases further, sensitivity drops as cloud cover and planetary albedo stabilize. No water vapor-induced runaway greenhouse caused by increased CO2 was found for the range of CO2 examined. With CO2 at or below 1/8 of the 1950 value, runaway sea ice does occur as the planet cascades to a snowball Earth climate with fully ice covered oceans and global mean surface temperatures near -30\textdegree C.},

Several observations and theoretical arguments seem to support the idea that winter planetary waves indicator obey a non-Gaussian statistics and may present a multimodal probability density function, thus characterizing the low-frequency portion of the climate system. We show that the upper tropospheric jet strength is a critical parameter in determining whether the planetary waves indicator exhibits a uni- or bimodal behavior, and we determine the relevant threshold value of the jet. These results are obtained by considering the data of the NCEP-NCAR and ECMWF reanalyses for the overlapping period.

The global-mean surface temperature decreases with increasing \$\$\{\textbackslash rm P\}\_\{rot\}\$\$and sea ice expands equatorwards. The cooling of the mean climate with increasing \$\$\{\textbackslash rm P\}\_\{rot\}\$\$is caused partly by the high surface albedo of sea ice on the dayside and partly by the high albedo of the deep convective clouds over the substellar region. The cooling caused by these deep convective clouds is weak for non-synchronous rotations compared to synchronous rotation. Sensitivity simulations with the sea-ice model switched off show that the global-mean surface temperature is up to 27 K higher than in our main simulations with sea ice and thus highlight the large influence of sea ice on the climate. We present the first estimates of the influence of the rotation period on the transition of an Earth-like climate to global glaciation. Our results suggest that global glaciation of planets with synchronous rotation occurs at substantially lower incoming solar irradiation than for planets with slow but non-synchronous rotation.},

Analysis of the turbulence model suggests that the most energetic wavenumbers equilibrate from scattering of the temperature perturbations into higher wavenumbers by the barotropic adverting field.

Here, the role of the Antarctic surface height for meridional heat transport and local radiative feedbacks, including the surface albedo feedback, was investigated based on CO\textsubscript{2}-doubling experiments in a low-resolution coupled climate model. When Antarctica was assumed to be flat, the north\textendash south asymmetry of the zonal mean top of the atmosphere radiation budget was notably reduced. Doubling CO\textsubscript{2} in a flat Antarctica (flat AA) model setup led to a stronger increase in southern hemispheric poleward atmospheric and oceanic heat transport compared to the base model setup. Based on partial radiative perturbation (PRP) computations, it was shown that local radiative feedbacks and an increase in the CO\textsubscript{2} forcing in the deeper atmospheric column also contributed to stronger Antarctic warming in the flat AA model setup, and the roles of the individual radiative feedbacks are discussed in some detail. A considerable fraction (between 24 and 80 \% for three consecutive 25-year time slices starting in year 51 and ending in year 126 after CO\textsubscript{2} doubling) of the polar amplification asymmetry was explained by the difference in surface height, but the fraction was subject to transient changes and might to some extent also depend on model uncertainties. In order to arrive at a more reliable estimate of the role of land height for the observed polar amplification asymmetry, additional studies based on ensemble runs from higher-resolution models and an improved model setup with a more realistic gradual increase in the CO\textsubscript{2} concentration are required.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Because the atmosphere and ocean are interacting systems, it is inappropriate to specify sea surface temperature when dealing with the atmosphere, or atmospheric anemometer level temperature and moisture when dealing with the ocean. All of these quantities should be determined interactively in terms of the external forcing: the solar constant. In the tropics, it is shown that the (cumulus) convective processes may be described by a one-dimensional cloud model. The near-surface ocean may similarly be described by a one-dimensional mixed-layer model. The coupling is achieved through a sea surface flux budget combined with the flux parameterizations implied by Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. The coupled one-dimensional atmosphere-ocean model is applied to the equilibrium situation in which all temperatures reach a steady state. Since the ocean, lacking an internal heating or cooling mechanism, can only be heated or cooled through sensibleheat fluxes through the sea surface, in equilibrium these fluxes must vanish. The atmosphere, however, maintains a stable lapse rate by balancing cumulonimbus heating against net radiative cooling. All water precipitated from cumulonimbus clouds must have evaporated from sea surface. It is shown that this equilibrium system is closed and determinable solely in terms of the solar constant. For various values of the solar constant, the sea surface temperature, the flux of latent and sensible heat from the surface, the height of the tropopause, mixed layer, and trade inversion layer, and generally, the entire vertical structure of the tropical atmosphere and near-surface ocean can be determined. The equilibrium sea surface temperature is shown to be relatively insensitive to changes in the solar constant, additional solar flux being compensated mainly by additional evaporation. Finally, the usefulness and limitations of the model are pointed out.},

  abstract = {Abstract Suarez and Duffy have noted an interesting bifurcation in a two-level gridpoint general circulation model when strong tropical heating is imposed. This bifurcation results in a model climatology with strong upper-level westerlies in the tropics. In this paper, it is argued that this bifurcation is essentially due to the dominant role played by extratropical baroclinic transients in the tropical angular momentum budget. A series of numerical experiments is analyzed with a global two-level primitive equation model, using spectral truncation in the horizontal. The model climatologies in these experiments fall into two categories: 1) conventional, that is, weak upper-level easterlies/westerlies in the tropics; and 2) superrotating, that is, strong upper-level westerlies in the tropics. An attempt is made to explain the maintenance of the general circulation in these two radically different climatologies by studying the properties of unstable normal modes for the two different time-mean states. The spectral characteristics of angular momentum transport due to transient eddies in these two climatologies are also discussed. To understand the meridional propagation of transient eddies, the notion of a ``modal'' refractive index in the quasigeostrophic approximation is introduced. From this analysis it is concluded that the conventional climatology is stable to weak perturbations, with the ``restoring'' force being provided primarily by extratropical baroclinic eddies. Strong perturbations completely change the propagation characteristics of these eddies, leading to a bifurcation of the general circulation. This has interesting implications for the range of validity of two-level models and the transitivity of tropospheric general circulation.},

Horizontal resolution is often cited as the main culprit for blocking errors due to poorly resolved small-scale variability, the upscale effects of which help to maintain blocks. Although these processes are important for blocking, the authors show that much of the blocking error diagnosed using common methods of analysis and current climate models is directly attributable to the climatological bias of the model. This explains a large proportion of diagnosed blocking error in models used in the recent Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change report. Furthermore, greatly improved statistics are obtained by diagnosing blocking using climate model data corrected to account for mean model biases. To the extent that mean biases may be corrected in low-resolution models, this suggests that such models may be able to generate greatly improved levels of atmospheric blocking.},

Integrating lessons from other genres of writing with those from the author's years of experience as author, reviewer, and editor, the book shows scientists and students how to present their research in a way that is clear and that will maximize reader comprehension.The book takes an integrated approach, using the principles of story structure to discuss every aspect of successful science writing, from the overall structure of a paper or proposal to individual sections, paragraphs, sentences, and words. It begins by building core arguments, analyzing why some stories are engaging and memorable while others are quickly forgotten, and proceeds to the elements of story structure, showing how the structures scientists and researchers use in papers and proposals fit into classical models. The book targets the internal structure of a paper, explaining how to write clear and professional sections, paragraphs, and sentences in a way that is clear and compelling. The ideas within a paper should flow seamlessly, drawing readers along. The final section of the book deals with special challenges, such as how to discuss research limitations and how to write for the public. Writing Science is a much-needed guide to succeeding in modern science. Its insights and strategies will equip science students, scientists, and professionals across a wide range of scientific and technical fields with the tools needed to communicate effectively.},

The framework is used to study the feedbacks among soil, boundary layer, and diurnal convection. It includes a setup with explicit convection and a full set of parameterizations. Predicted variables are constantly relaxed toward prescribed atmospheric profiles and soil conditions. The relaxation is weak in the lower troposphere and upper soil to allow the development of a realistic diurnal planetary boundary layer. The model is run to its own equilibrium (30 days).             The framework is able to produce a realistic timing of the diurnal cycle of convection. It also confirms the development of deeper convection in a more unstably stratified atmosphere.             With this relaxation method, the simulated ``diurnal equilibrium convection'' determines the humidity profile of the lower atmosphere, and the simulation becomes insensitive to the reference humidity profile. However, if a faster relaxation time is used in the lower troposphere, the convection and rainfall become much more sensitive to the reference humidity, consistent with previous studies.},

This underestimate is most pronounced in regions of persistent cloud cover and high surface albedos\textemdash the snow- and ice-covered regions of the high latitude zone, for example. Since the rate of snow melt (and thus snow albedo) depends upon the downward flux, neglect of multiple reflection is most serious in climatic models that predict snow and ice cover. Two simple algebraic expressions to account for multiple reflections in climate models are given and are shown to be limiting cases of a more general formula. Since this more general formula depends on the spatial distribution of subgrid-scale cloud cover amounts, an unambiguous definition of cloud amount over a GCM-scale grid square cannot be given, even if perfect knowledge of the optical properties of the subgrid-scale clouds were in hand. However, the uncertainties in downward solar flux at the earth's surface (or the albedo of the combined cloudiness-surface system) introduced by lack of knowledge of the two-dimensional geometric distribution of fractional cloud cover are shown to be generally less than 10\%, most likely less than the errors in predicting cloud cover amounts or from the neglect of three-dimensional effects of finite-sized clouds.},

The warming is significantly reduced when sea surface temperatures in the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue region between latitudes 2.25\textdegree N and 2.25\textdegree S are held at the control simulation values. Warming of the global mean temperature outside of the cold tongue region is reduced from 2.4\textdegree C in the unconstrained case to 1.9\textdegree C when the sea surface temperature constraint is applied. The decrease in the warming results from a positive net heat flux into the ocean cold tongue region and implicit heat storage in the subsurface ocean, induced by horizontal atmospheric heat fluxes. The reduced surface temperature warming outside of the cold tongue region is due to reduction in the downward longwave radiative flux at the surface, caused in turn by reduced atmospheric temperature and moisture. The global mean surface temperature responds to the heat storage in the ocean as if the global mean radiative forcing due to the doubled CO\textsubscript{2} (approximately 4 W m\textsuperscript{-2}) was reduced by the value of the global mean heat flux into the ocean. This mechanism also provides a possible explanation for the observed high correlation on interannual timescales between the global mean tropospheric temperature and sea surface temperature in the eastern tropical Pacific. The results emphasize the importance of correctly modeling the dynamical processes in the ocean and atmosphere that help determine the sea surface temperature in the equatorial eastern Pacific, in addition to the thermodynamical processes, in projecting global warming.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This study extends the global analysis of the transient response to zonal averages, using a hierarchy of simple energy balance models and vertical mixing assumptions for water exchange between upper and deeper oceanic layers. It is found that because of the latitudinal dependence of both thermal inertia and radiative and dynamic energy exchange mechanisms, the approach toward equilibrium of the surface temperature of various regions of the earth will be significantly different from the global average approach. This suggests that the actual time evolution of the horizontal surface temperature gradients\textemdash{} and any associated regional climatic anomalies\textemdash may well be significantly different from that suggested by equilibrium climatic modeling simulations (or those computed with a highly unrealistic geographic distribution of ocean thermal capacity). Also, the transient response as a function of latitude is significantly different between globally equivalent CO2 and solar constant forcing runs. It is suggested that the nature of the transient response is a major uncertainty in characterizing the CO2 problem and that study of this topic should become a major priority for future research. An appendix puts this issue in the context of the overall CO2 problem.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting climate change have recently acquired a sense of urgency with the advent of serious climate-related food shortages and with the realization that human activities may have an influence on climate. Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive theory of climate to explain its variability, nor are there physical models that can adequately simulate the climate system. Hence there is a serious need for the development of quantitative mathematical models of climate, first to derive better understanding and ultimately to allow some degree of predictive capability. Many modeling approaches are available, ranging from simple one-dimensional representation of the vertical radiative processes in the atmosphere up to very complex mathematical systems that describe the three-dimensional behavior of the circulation of the atmosphere and ocean along with the chemical and thermodynamical processes that control the hydrological cycle and the existence of sea ice. Since the simpler models isolate the important physical processes that determine the climate, we weigh our discussion more heavily toward these but also discuss many aspects of the more complex models. We try to stress the fundamental physical basis of each kind of model and its contribution to the understanding of the simultaneous interactions (or feedbacks) of the many coupled processes that determine the climate. One difficulty in predicting climate change is the large degree of cancellation that occurs between many of the climatic feedback mechanisms. Considerable discussion is included of the applications of theories of baroclinic disturbances to the parameterization of eddy heat fluxes. Also stressed are basic energy balance approaches to the calculation of the surface temperature. Finally, we give our view of the future of climate modeling and argue that a flexible plan that vigorously pursues many avenues of approach is preferable. Although this review is often critical, we hope that it serves (1) to illustrate the multidisciplinary nature of climate simulation modeling and (2) to clarify the relative importance of individual contributions to the broader problems of understanding and (ultimately) predicting climate change.},

The center of the summer and equinox Hadley cell lies in a latitude zone of upper-level westerlies and significant eddy momentum flux divergence; the influence of eddy momentum fluxes on the strength of the cell is strong. The center of the cross-equatorial winter Hadley cell lies in a latitude zone of upper-level easterlies and is shielded from the energy-containing midlatitude eddies; the influence of eddy momentum fluxes on the strength of the cell is weak. Mediated by feedbacks between eddy fluxes, mean zonal winds at upper levels, and the mean meridional circulation, the dominant balance in the zonal momentum equation at the center of a Hadley cell shifts at the transitions between the regimes, from eddies dominating the momentum flux divergence in the summer and equinox cell to the mean meridional circulation dominating in the winter cell. At the transitions, a feedback involving changes in the strength of the lower-level temperature advection and in the latitude of the boundary between the winter and summer cell is responsible for changes in the strength of the cross-equatorial winter cell. The transitions resemble the onset and end of monsoons, for example, in the shift in the dominant zonal momentum balance, rapid shifts in the latitudes of maximum meridional mass flux and of maximum convergence at lower levels, rapid changes in strength of the upward mass flux, and changes in direction and strength of the zonal wind at upper and lower levels. In the monsoonal regime, the maximum upward mass flux occurs in an off-equatorial convergence zone located where the balance of the meridional geopotential gradient in the planetary boundary layer shifts from nonlinear frictional to geostrophic. Similar dynamic mechanisms as at the regime transitions in the simulation\textemdash mechanisms that can act irrespective of land\textendash sea contrasts and other inhomogeneities in lower boundary conditions\textemdash may be implicated in large-scale monsoon dynamics in Earth's atmosphere.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Variations of the lapse rate toward which the parameterized moist convection in the model relaxes atmospheric temperature profiles demonstrate that the convective lapse rate only marginally affects the extratropical thermal stratification in Earth-like and colder climates. In warmer climates, the convective lapse rate does affect the extratropical thermal stratification, but the effect is still smaller than would be expected if moist convection alone controlled the thermal stratification. A theory for how large-scale eddies modify the thermal stratification of dry atmospheres is consistent with the simulation results for colder climates. For warmer and moister climates, however, theories and heuristics that have been proposed to account for the extratropical thermal stratification are not consistent with the simulation results. Theories for the extratropical thermal stratification will generally have to take transport of sensible and latent heat by large-scale eddies into account, but moist convection may only need to be taken into account regionally and in sufficiently warm climates.},

However, as their dynamical scales are too small to be resolvable in global climate models, predictions of their response to greenhouse warming have remained uncertain. Here we report how stratocumulus decks respond to greenhouse warming in large-eddy simulations that explicitly resolve cloud dynamics in a representative subtropical region. In the simulations, stratocumulus decks become unstable and break up into scattered clouds when CO2 levels rise above 1,200\,ppm. In addition to the warming from rising CO2 levels, this instability triggers a surface warming of about 8\,K globally and 10\,K in the subtropics. Once the stratocumulus decks have broken up, they only re-form once CO2 concentrations drop substantially below the level at which the instability first occurred. Climate transitions that arise from this instability may have contributed importantly to hothouse climates and abrupt climate changes in the geological past. Such transitions to a much warmer climate may also occur in the future if CO2 levels continue to rise.},

Yet weakly nonlinear models successfully account for scales and structures of baroclinic eddies in Earth's atmosphere. Here a theory and simulations with an idealized GCM are presented that suggest weakly nonlinear models are so successful because atmospheric macroturbulence organizes itself into critical states of weak nonlinear eddy\textendash eddy interactions. By modifying the thermal structure of the extratropical atmosphere such that its supercriticality remains limited, macroturbulence inhibits nonlinear eddy\textendash eddy interactions and the concomitant inverse energy cascade from the length scales of baroclinic instability to larger scales. For small meridional surface temperature gradients, the extratropical thermal stratification and tropopause height are set by radiation and convection, and the supercriticality is less than one; for sufficiently large meridional surface temperature gradients, the extratropical thermal stratification and tropopause height are modified by baroclinic eddies such that the supercriticality does not significantly exceed one. In either case, the scale of the energy-containing eddies is similar to the scale of the linearly most unstable baroclinic waves, and eddy kinetic and available potential energies are equipartitioned. The theory and simulations point to fundamental constraints on the thermal structures and global circulations of the atmospheres of Earth and other planets, for example, by providing limits on the tropopause height and estimates for eddy scales, eddy energies, and jet separation scales.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Discussions of countering global warming with solar geoengineering assume that warming owing to rising greenhouse-gas concentrations can be compensated by artificially reducing the amount of sunlight Earth absorbs. However, solar geoengineering may not be fail-safe to prevent global warming because CO2 can directly affect cloud cover: It reduces cloud cover by modulating the longwave radiative cooling within the atmosphere. This effect is not mitigated by solar geoengineering. Here, we use idealized high-resolution simulations of clouds to show that, even under a sustained solar geoengineering scenario with initially only modest warming, subtropical stratocumulus clouds gradually thin and may eventually break up into scattered cumulus clouds, at concentrations exceeding 1,700 parts per million (ppm). Because stratocumulus clouds cover large swaths of subtropical oceans and cool Earth by reflecting incident sunlight, their loss would trigger strong (about 5 K) global warming. Thus, the results highlight that, at least in this extreme and idealized scenario, solar geoengineering may not suffice to counter greenhouse-gas-driven global warming.},

Through the release of latent heat when it condenses, it also plays an active role in dynamic processes that shape the global circulation of the atmosphere and thus climate. Here we present an overview of how latent heat release affects atmosphere dynamics in a broad range of climates, ranging from extremely cold to extremely warm. Contrary to widely held beliefs, atmospheric circulation statistics can change nonmonotonically with global-mean surface temperature, in part because of dynamic effects of water vapor. For example, the strengths of the tropical Hadley circulation and of zonally asymmetric tropical circulations, as well as the kinetic energy of extratropical baroclinic eddies, can be lower than they presently are both in much warmer climates and in much colder climates. We discuss how latent heat release is implicated in such circulation changes, particularly through its effect on the atmospheric static stability, and we illustrate the circulation changes through simulations with an idealized general circulation model. This allows us to explore a continuum of climates, to constrain macroscopic laws governing this climatic continuum, and to place past and possible future climate changes in a broader context.},

Together with accumulation, this outflow is the main control on the mass balance of the grounded sheet. In this paper, we verify the results of a boundary layer theory for ice flux in the transition zone against numerical solutions that are able to resolve the transition zone. Very close agreement is obtained, and grid refinement in the transition zone is identified as a critical component in obtaining reliable numerical results. The boundary layer theory confirms that ice flux through the grounding line in a two-dimensional sheet-shelf system increases sharply with ice thickness at the grounding line. This result is then applied to the large-scale dynamics of a marine ice sheet. Our principal results are that (1) marine ice sheets do not exhibit neutral equilibrium but have well-defined, discrete equilibrium profiles; (2) steady grounding lines cannot be stable on reverse bed slopes; and (3) marine ice sheets with overdeepened beds can undergo hysteresis under variations in sea level, accumulation rate, basal slipperiness, and ice viscosity. This hysteretic behavior can in principle explain the retreat of the West Antarctic ice sheet following the Last Glacial Maximum and may play a role in the dynamics of Heinrich events.},

  abstract = {Abstract Observational and modeling studies documented in the literature indicate that the large-scale flow has an important effect on the structure and evolution of low-level fronts in midlatitude cyclones. The purpose of this paper is to address the role of the large-scale flow on low-level cyclone/frontal structure and evolution through a combined observational and idealized modeling approach. Analyses of two observed cyclone cases embedded in large-scale diffluence and confluence, respectively, are presented to illustrate two possible cyclone/frontal structures and evolutions. Specifically, the cyclone moving into a diffluent, high-amplitude ridge becomes meridionally elongated and possesses a strong meridionally oriented cold front and a weak warm front. The cold front rotates into the warm front, forming an occluded front in the manner of the Norwegian cyclone model, as indicated by the narrowing of the thermal ridge connecting the warm sector to the cyclone center. In contrast, the cyclone moving into confluent, low-amplitude zonal flow becomes zonally elongated and possesses strong zonally oriented warm and bent-back fronts and a weak cold front. The frontal structure in this case is reminiscent of the Shapiro\textendash Keyser cyclone model, exhibiting a fracture between perpendicularly oriented cold and warm fronts (i.e., the so-called frontal T-bone structure). The idealized simulations employ a nondivergent barotropic model in which potential temperature is treated as a passive tracer. When a circular vortex acts on an initially zonally oriented baroclinic zone, cold and warm fronts, a frontal fracture, a bent-back front, and eventually a Norwegian-like occlusion develop. When a circular vortex is placed in a diffluent background flow, the vortex and frontal zones become meridionally elongated, and the evolution resembles the Norwegian occlusion with a narrowing thermal ridge. When a circular vortex is placed in a confluent background flow, the vortex and frontal zones become zonally elongated, and the evolution resembles the Shapiro\textendash Keyser model with a frontal fracture, frontal T-bone, and bent-back front. Although the idealized model qualitatively reproduces many of the frontal features found in the observed cyclones analyzed in the present study, one significant difference is that the maximum potential temperature gradient and frontogenesis along the cold and warm fronts may differ by a factor of 2 or more in the observed cases, but remain equal along the cold and warm fronts throughout the idealized model simulations. Possible reasons for this asymmetry in the strength of the observed cold and warm fronts are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract In response to Sherwood's comments and in an attempt to restore proper usage of terminology associated with moist instability, the early history of moist instability is reviewed. This review shows that many of Sherwood's concerns about the terminology were understood at the time of their origination. Definitions of conditional instability include both the lapse-rate definition (i.e., the environmental lapse rate lies between the dry- and the moist-adiabatic lapse rates) and the available-energy definition (i.e., a parcel possesses positive buoyant energy; also called latent instability), neither of which can be considered an instability in the classic sense. Furthermore, the lapse-rate definition is really a statement of uncertainty about instability. The uncertainty can be resolved by including the effects of moisture through a consideration of the available-energy definition (i.e., convective available potential energy) or potential instability. It is shown that such misunderstandings about conditional instability were likely due to the simplifications resulting from the substitution of lapse rates for buoyancy in the vertical acceleration equation. Despite these valid concerns about the value of the lapse-rate definition of conditional instability, consideration of the lapse rate and moisture separately can be useful in some contexts (e.g., the ingredients-based methodology for forecasting deep, moist convection). It is argued that the release of potential (or convective) instability through layer lifting may occur in association with fronts, rather than with isolated convection, the terminology ``convective'' being an unfortunate modifier. The merits and demerits of slantwise convective available potential energy are discussed, with the hope of improving diagnostic methodologies for assessing slantwise convection. Finally, it is argued that, when assessing precipitation events, undue emphasis may appear to be placed on instability, rather than the forcing for ascent, which should be of primary importance.},

In January 1873, the U.S. War Department's Army Signal Service began producing this monthly report summarizing weather across the United States. Its first issue consisted of a one-page narrative of weather conditions and storms and one chart depicting tracks of low pressure centers during that month. In 1891, Monthly Weather Review continued as a government publication with the transfer of the nation's weather service from the military to the newly established U.S. Weather Bureau. Over time and sometimes erratically, it grew into a scientific journal. In 1974, Monthly Weather Review was transferred to the American Meteorological Society, who continues to publish it to this day (although a 2003 proposal might have ended it). This Historical Review discusses some of the journal's history and impact, as well as its legacy. This review also compiles for the first time a complete list of Monthly Weather Review editors. The research published within Monthly Weather Review has included highly cited, ground-breaking articles on weather and climate phenomena (e.g., extratropical and tropical cyclones, El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation, Madden\textendash Julian oscillation), general circulation modeling, and numerical weather prediction.

  abstract = {Traditionally, the formation of an occluded front during the occlusion process in extratropical cyclones has been viewed as the catch-up of a faster-moving cold front to a slower-moving warm front separating the warm-sector air from the low center, as first described in the Norwegian cyclone model over 90 yr ago. In this article, the conventional wisdom, or the commonly held beliefs originating from the Norwegian cyclone model, about occluded fronts and the occlusion process are critically examined. The following four tenets of this conventional wisdom are addressed. First, the occlusion process is better described not by catch-up, but by the wrapping up and lengthening of the warm-air tongue as a result of deformation and rotation around the low center. Second, the merger of the cold front and warm front does not result in the frontal zone with the warmer air ascending over the other frontal zone. Instead, the occluded frontal zone tilts over the more statically stable frontal zone. Because a warmfrontal zone tends to be more stable than a cold-frontal zone, this process usually produces a warm-type occlusion, confirming that cold-type occlusions are less common than warm-type occlusions. Third, occlusion does not mean that the cyclone has stopped deepening, because many cyclones continue to deepen 10\textendash 30 mb for 12\textendash 36 h after the formation of the occluded front. Fourth, clouds and precipitation associated with occluded fronts differ from their widespread stratiform depiction in textbooks. Embedded precipitation bands may be parallel to the front, and little relationship may exist between the fronts and the cloud mass. These four tenets help to explain anomalies in the Norwegian cyclone model, such as how occluded fronts that spiral around the low center do not require catch-up to form, how Shapiro\textendash Keyser cyclones undergo occlusion, why some cyclones do not form occluded fronts, how some cyclones deepen after occlusion, why few cold-type occlusions have been observed, and why occluded cyclones are often associated with heavy precipitation. This reexamination of conventional wisdom leads to a new paradigm for occluded fronts and occluded cyclones. A supplement to this article is available online: DOI: 10.1175/2010BAMS3057.2},

  abstract = {Abstract Despite the popularity of the conveyor-belt model for portraying the airflow through midlatitude cyclones, questions arise as to the path of the cold conveyor belt, the lower-tropospheric airflow poleward of and underneath the warm front. Some studies, beginning with Carlson's analysis of the eastern U.S. cyclone of 5 December 1977, depict the cold conveyor belt moving westward, reaching the northwest quadrant of the storm, turning abruptly anticyclonically, rising to jet level, and departing the cyclone downstream (hereafter, the anticyclonic path). Other studies depict the cold conveyor belt reaching the northwest quadrant, turning cyclonically around the low center, and remaining in the lower troposphere (the cyclonic path). To clarify the path of the cold conveyor belt, the present study reexamines Carlson's analysis of the cold conveyor belt using an observational and mesoscale numerical modeling study of the 5 December 1977 cyclone. This reexamination raises several previously unappreciated and underappreciated issues. First, airflow in the vicinity of the warm front is shown to be composed of three different airstreams: air-parcel trajectories belonging to the ascending warm conveyor belt, air-parcel trajectories belonging to the cyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt that originate from the lower troposphere, and air-parcel trajectories belonging to the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt that originate within the midtroposphere. Thus, the 5 December 1977 storm consists of a cold conveyor belt with both cyclonic and anticyclonic paths. Second, the anticyclonic path represents a transition between the warm conveyor belt and the cyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt, which widens with height. Third, the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt is related to the depth of the closed circulation associated with the cyclone, which increases as the cyclone deepens and evolves. When the closed circulation is strong and deep, the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt is not apparent and the cyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt dominates. Fourth, Carlson's analysis of the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt was fortuitous because his selection of isentropic surface occurred within the transition zone, whereas, if a slightly colder isentropic surface were selected, the much broader lower-tropospheric cyclonic path would have been evident in his analysis instead. Finally, whereas Carlson concludes that the clouds and precipitation in the cloud head were associated with the anticyclonic path of the cold conveyor belt, results from the model simulation suggest that the clouds and precipitation originated within the ascending warm conveyor belt. As a consequence of the reexamination of the 5 December 1977 storm using air-parcel trajectories, this paper clarifies the structure of and terminology associated with the cold conveyor belt. It is speculated that cyclones with well-defined warm fronts will have a sharp demarcation between the cyclonic and anticyclonic paths of the cold conveyor belt. In contrast, cyclones with weaker warm fronts will have a broad transition zone between the two paths. Finally, the implications of this research for forecasting warm-frontal precipitation amount and type are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract The conceptual model of a classical surface-based cold front consists of a sharp temperature decrease coincident with a pressure trough and a distinct wind shift at the surface. Many cold fronts, however, do not conform to this model\textemdash time series at a single surface station may possess a pressure trough and wind shift in the warm air preceding the cold front (hereafter called a prefrontal trough and prefrontal wind shift, respectively). Although many authors have recognized these prefrontal features previously, a review of the responsible mechanisms has not been performed to date. This paper presents such a review. Ten disparate mechanisms with different frontal structures have been identified from the previous literature. These mechanisms include those external to the front (i.e., those not directly associated with the cold front itself): synoptic-scale forcing, interaction with lee troughs/drylines, interaction with fronts in the mid- and upper troposphere, and frontogenesis associated with inhomogeneities in the prefrontal air. Mechanisms internal to the front (i.e., those directly associated with the structure and dynamics of the front) include the following: surface friction, frontogenesis acting on alongfront temperature gradients, moist processes, descent of air, ascent of air at the front, and generation of prefrontal bores/gravity waves. Given the gaps in our knowledge of the structure, evolution, and dynamics of surface cold fronts, this paper closes with an admonition for improving the links between theory, observations, and modeling to advance understanding and develop better conceptual models of cold fronts, with the goal of improving both scientific understanding and operational forecasting.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study examines the characteristics of a large number of extreme rain events over the eastern two-thirds of the United States. Over a 5-yr period, 184 events are identified where the 24-h precipitation total at one or more stations exceeds the 50-yr recurrence amount for that location. Over the entire region of study, these events are most common in July. In the northern United States, extreme rain events are confined almost exclusively to the warm season; in the southern part of the country, these events are distributed more evenly throughout the year. National composite radar reflectivity data are used to classify each event as a mesoscale convective system (MCS), a synoptic system, or a tropical system, and then to classify the MCS and synoptic events into subclassifications based on their organizational structures. This analysis shows that 66\% of all the events and 74\% of the warm-season events are associated with MCSs; nearly all of the cool-season events are caused by storms with strong synoptic forcing. Similarly, nearly all of the extreme rain events in the northern part of the country are caused by MCSs; synoptic and tropical systems play a larger role in the South and East. MCS-related events are found to most commonly begin at around 1800 local standard time (LST), produce their peak rainfall between 2100 and 2300 LST, and dissipate or move out of the affected area by 0300 LST.},

Recent studies have suggested that in future climate projections, precipitation variability rises more steeply than does its mean, leading to concerns about societal impacts. This work evaluates changes in mean precipitation over a broad range of spatial and temporal scales using a range of models from high-resolution regional simulations to millennial-scale global simulations. Results show that changes depend on the scale of aggregation and involve strong regional differences. On local scales that resolve individual rainfall events (hours and tens of kilometers), changes in precipitation distributions are complex and variances rise substantially more than means, as is required given the well-known disproportionate rise in precipitation intensity. On scales that aggregate across many events, distributional changes become simpler and variability changes smaller. At regional scale, future precipitation distributions can be largely reproduced by a simple transformation of present-day precipitation involving a multiplicative shift and a small additive term. The ``extra'' broadening is negatively correlated with changes in mean precipitation: in strongly ``wetting'' areas, distributions broaden less than expected from a simple multiplicative mean change; in ``drying'' areas, distributions narrow less. Precipitation variability changes are therefore of especial concern in the subtropics, which tend to dry under climate change. Outside the tropics, variability changes are similar on timescales from days to decades, i.e. show little frequency dependence. This behavior is highly robust across models, suggesting it may stem from some fundamental constraint.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

To reconcile this, previous studies have hypothesized that fall/winter Arctic warming has been enhanced by increased oceanic heat loss but have not presented quantitative evidence. Here we show increases in heat transfer from the Arctic Ocean to the overlying atmosphere during October\textendash January, 1989\textendash 2009. The trends in surface air temperature, sea ice concentration and the surface heat fluxes display remarkable spatial correspondence. The increased oceanic heat loss is likely a combination of the direct response to fall/winter sea ice loss, and the indirect response to summer sea ice loss and increased summer ocean heating.},

To understand better the atmospheric changes that may have occurred in response to Arctic sea ice loss, this study presents results from atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments in which the only time-varying forcings prescribed were observed variations in Arctic sea ice and accompanying changes in Arctic sea surface temperatures from 1979 to 2009. Two independent AGCMs are utilized in order to assess the robustness of the response across different models. The results suggest that the atmospheric impacts of Arctic sea ice loss have been manifested most strongly within the maritime and coastal Arctic and in the lowermost atmosphere. Sea ice loss has driven increased energy transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, enhanced warming and moistening of the lower troposphere, decreased the strength of the surface temperature inversion, and increased lower-tropospheric thickness; all of these changes are most pronounced in autumn and early winter (September\textendash December). The early winter (November\textendash December) atmospheric circulation response resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); however, the NAO-type response is quite weak and is often masked by intrinsic (unforced) atmospheric variability. Some evidence of a late winter (March\textendash April) polar stratospheric cooling response to sea ice loss is also found, which may have important implications for polar stratospheric ozone concentrations. The attribution and quantification of other aspects of the possible atmospheric response are hindered by model sensitivities and large intrinsic variability. The potential remote responses to Arctic sea ice change are currently hard to confirm and remain uncertain.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

An emerging and highly uncertain area of scientific research, however, is whether such Arctic change has a tangible effect on weather and climate at lower latitudes. Of particular societal relevance is the open question: will continued Arctic sea ice loss make mid-latitude weather more extreme? Here we analyse idealized atmospheric general circulation model simulations, using two independent models, both forced by projected Arctic sea ice loss in the late twenty-first century. We identify robust projected changes in regional temperature and precipitation extremes arising solely due to Arctic sea ice loss. The likelihood and duration of cold extremes are projected to decrease over high latitudes and over central and eastern North America, but to increase over central Asia. Hot extremes are projected to increase in frequency and duration over high latitudes. The likelihood and severity of wet extremes are projected to increase over high latitudes, the Mediterranean and central Asia; and their intensity is projected to increase over high latitudes and central and eastern Asia. The number of dry days over mid-latitude Eurasia and dry spell duration over high latitudes are both projected to decrease. There is closer model agreement for projected changes in temperature extremes than for precipitation extremes. Overall, we find that extreme weather over central and eastern North America is more sensitive to Arctic sea ice loss than over other mid-latitude regions. Our results are useful for constraining the role of Arctic sea ice loss in shifting the odds of extreme weather, but must not be viewed as deterministic projections, as they do not account for drivers other than Arctic sea ice loss.},

The media extensively reported the cold snap, including debate on whether human-induced climate change was partly responsible. Related to this, one particular hypothesis garnered considerable attention: that rapid Arctic sea ice loss may be increasing the risk of cold extremes in the midlatitudes. Here we use large ensembles of model simulations to explore how the risk of North American daily cold extremes is anticipated to change in the future, in response to increases in greenhouse gases and the component of that response solely due to Arctic sea ice loss. Specifically, we examine the changing probability of daily cold extremes as (un)common as the 7 January 2014 event. Projected increases in greenhouse gases decrease the likelihood of North American cold extremes in the future. Days as cold or colder than 7 January 2014 are still projected to occur in the mid-twenty-first century (2030\textendash 49), albeit less frequently than in the late twentieth century (1980\textendash 99). However, such events will cease to occur by the late twenty-first century (2080\textendash 99), assuming greenhouse gas emissions continue unabated. Continued Arctic sea ice loss is a major driver of decreased\textemdash not increased\textemdash North America cold extremes. Projected Arctic sea ice loss alone reduces the odds of such an event by one-quarter to one-third by the mid-twenty-first century, and to zero (or near zero) by the late twenty-first century.},

Theremote impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss can only be properly represented using modelsthat simulate interactions among the ocean, sea ice, land and atmosphere. Asynthesis of six such experiments with different models shows consistenthemispheric-wide atmospheric warming, strongest in the mid-to-high-latitude lowertroposphere; an intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low and, in most cases,the Siberian High; a weakening of the Icelandic Low; and a reduction in strength andsouthward shift of the mid-latitude westerly winds in winter. The atmosphericcirculation response seems to be sensitive to the magnitude and geographic patternof sea-ice loss and, in some cases, to the background climate state. However, it isunclear whether current-generation climate models respond too weakly to sea-icechange.

It has been argued that NAO-related variability can be used an as analogue to predict the effects of Arctic sea ice loss on mid-latitude weather. As NAO- events are associated with colder winters over Northern Europe, a negatively shifted NAO has been proposed as a dynamical pathway for Arctic sea ice loss to cause Northern European cooling. This study uses large-ensemble atmospheric simulations with prescribed ocean surface conditions to examine how seasonal-scale NAO- events are affected by Arctic sea ice loss. Despite an intensification of NAO- events, reflected by more prevalent easterly flow, sea ice loss does not lead to Northern European winter cooling and daily cold extremes actually decrease. The dynamical cooling from the changed NAO is `missing', because it is offset (or exceeded) by a thermodynamical effect owing to advection of warmer air masses.},

  abstract = {Is the transport of heat northward by the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, and its subsequent release into the midlatitude westerlies, the reason why Europe's winters are so much milder than those of eastern North America and other places at the same latitude? Here, it is shown that the principal cause of this temperature difference is advection by the mean winds. South-westerlies bring warm maritime air into Europe and north-westerlies bring frigid continental air into north-eastern North America. Further, analysis of the ocean surface heat budget shows that the majority of the heat released during winter from the ocean to the atmosphere is accounted for by the seasonal release of heat previously absorbed and not by ocean heat-flux convergence. Therefore, the existence of the winter temperature contrast between western Europe and eastern North America does not require a dynamical ocean. Two experiments with an atmospheric general-circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer confirm this conclusion. The difference in winter temperatures across the North Atlantic, and the difference between western Europe and western North America, is essentially the same in these models whether or not the movement of heat by the ocean is accounted for. In an additional experiment with no mountains, the flow across the ocean is more zonal, western Europe is cooled, the trough east of the Rockies is weakened and the cold of north-eastern North America is ameliorated. In all experiments the west coast of Europe is warmer than the west coast of North America at the same latitude whether or not ocean heat transport is accounted for. In summary the deviations from zonal symmetry of winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere are fundamentally caused by the atmospheric circulation interacting with the oceanic mixed layer.

The contributions to changes in precipitation minus evaporation, P - E, caused thermodynamically by changes in specific humidity, dynamically by changes in circulation, and by changes in moisture transports by transient eddies are evaluated. The thermodynamic and dynamic contributions are further separated into advective and divergent components. The nonthermodynamic contributions are then related to changes in the mean and transient circulation. The projected change in P - E involves an intensification of the existing pattern of P - E with wet areas [the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and mid- to high latitudes] getting wetter and arid and semiarid regions of the subtropics getting drier. In addition, the subtropical dry zones expand poleward. The accentuation of the twentieth-century pattern of P - E is in part explained by increases in specific humidity via both advection and divergence terms. Weakening of the tropical divergent circulation partially opposes the thermodynamic contribution by creating a tendency to decreased P - E in the ITCZ and to increased P - E in the descending branches of the Walker and Hadley cells. The changing mean circulation also causes decreased P - E on the poleward flanks of the subtropics because the descending branch of the Hadley Cell expands and the midlatitude meridional circulation cell shifts poleward. Subtropical drying and poleward moistening are also contributed to by an increase in poleward moisture transport by transient eddies. The thermodynamic contribution to changing P - E, arising from increased specific humidity, is almost entirely accounted for by atmospheric warming under fixed relative humidity.},

During events of heat and moisture advection into the Arctic, increases in tropospheric temperature and moisture impact clouds, in turn impacting longwave (LW) radiation. State-of-the-art satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis consistently reveal an enhancement of summer Arctic monthly OLR cooling ranging 1.5\textendash 4 W m-2 during months with anomalously high thermodynamic advection. This cooling anomaly is found to be of the same magnitude or slightly larger than associated downwelling LW surface warming anomalies. We identify a relationship between large-scale circulation variability and changing cloud properties permitting LW radiation at both the surface and top of the atmosphere to respond to variability in atmospheric thermodynamics. Driven by anomalous advection of warm air, the corresponding enhanced OLR cooling signal on monthly time scales represents an important buffer to regional Arctic warming.},

Thus, if SRM were used to offset all CO2-induced mean warming, global-mean precipitation would be less than in an unperturbed climate. Here, we show that the mismatch between the mean hydrological effects of CO2 and SRM may partly be alleviated by spectrally tuning the SRM intervention (reducing insolation at some wavelengths more than others). By concentrating solar dimming at near-infrared wavelengths, where H2O has strong absorption bands, the direct effect of CO2 on the tropospheric energy budget can be offset, which minimizes perturbations to the mean hydrological cycle. Idealized cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium confirm that spectrally tuned SRM can simultaneously maintain mean surface temperature and precipitation at their unperturbed values even as large quantities of CO2 are added to the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract             How will warming temperatures influence thunderstorm severity? This question can be explored by using climate models to diagnose changes in large-scale convective instability (CAPE) and wind shear, conditions that are known to be conducive to the formation of severe thunderstorms. First, an ensemble of climate models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) is evaluated on its ability to reproduce a radiosonde climatology of such storm-favorable conditions in the current climate's spring and summer seasons, focusing on the contiguous United States (CONUS). Of the 11 climate models evaluated, a high-performing subset of four (GFDL CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, MRI-CGCM3, and NorESM1-M) is identified. Second, the twenty-first-century changes in the frequency of environments favorable to severe thunderstorms are calculated in these high-performing models as they are forced by the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emissions pathways. For the RCP8.5 scenario, the models predict consistent CONUS-mean fractional springtime increases in the range of 50\%\textendash 180\% by the end of the twenty-first century; for the summer, three of the four models predict increases in the range of 40\%\textendash 120\% and one model predicts a small decrease. This disagreement between the models is traced to divergent projections for future CAPE and boundary layer humidity in the Great Plains. This paper also explores the sensitivity of the results to the relative weight given to wind shear in determining how ``favorable'' a large-scale environment is for the development of severe thunderstorms, and it is found that this weighting is not the dominant source of uncertainty in projections of future thunderstorm severity.},

It has been argued that a FAT should result from simple ingredients: Clausius-Clapeyron, longwave emission from water vapor, and tropospheric energy and mass balance. Here the first cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium designed to contain only these basic ingredients are presented. This setup does not produce a FAT: the anvil temperature varies by about 40\% of the surface temperature range. However, the tropopause temperature varies by only 4\% of the surface temperature range, which supports the existence of a Fixed Tropopause Temperature (FiTT). In full-complexity radiative-convective equilibrium simulations, the spread in anvil temperature is smaller by about a factor of 2, but the tropopause temperature remains more invariant than the anvil temperature by an order of magnitude. In other words, our simulations have a FiTT, not a FAT.},

The conventional paradigm for these clouds attributes their existence to the rapidly declining convective mass flux below the tropopause, which implies a large source of detraining cloudy air there. Here we test this paradigm by manipulating the sources and sinks of cloudy air in cloud-resolving simulations. We find that anvils form in our simulations because of the long lifetime of upper-tropospheric cloud condensates, not because of an enhanced source of cloudy air below the tropopause. We further show that cloud lifetimes are long in the cold upper troposphere because the saturation specific humidity is much smaller there than the condensed water loading of cloudy updrafts, which causes evaporative cloud decay to act very slowly. Our results highlight the need for novel cloud-fraction schemes that align with this decay-centric framework for anvil clouds.},

Here, we propose an explanation for this ECS peak using a novel spectrally resolved decomposition of clear-sky longwave feedbacks. We show that the interplay between spectral feedbacks in H2O-dominated and CO2-dominated portions of the longwave spectrum, along with moist-adiabatic amplification of upper-tropospheric warming, conspire to produce a minimum in the feedback parameter, and a corresponding peak in ECS, at a surface temperature of 310 K. Mechanism-denial tests highlight three key ingredients for the ECS peak: (1) H2O continuum absorption to quickly close spectral windows at high surface temperature; (2) moist-adiabatic tropospheric temperatures to enhance upper-tropospheric warming; and (3) energetically consistent increases of CO2 with surface temperature.},

Most importantly, poleward movement of large-scale atmospheric circulation systems, such as jet streams and storm tracks, could result in shifts in precipitation patterns affecting natural ecosystems, agriculture, and water resources. The implications of the expansion for stratospheric circulation and the distribution of ozone in the atmosphere are as yet poorly understood. The observed recent rate of expansion is greater than climate model projections of expansion over the twenty-first century, which suggests that there is still much to be learned about this aspect of global climate change.},

Benchmark solutions of the kinetic collection equations are performed using a Monte Carlo superdroplet algorithm. The superdroplet method provides reliable but noisy estimates of the warm-rain process rates. For each process rate, a neural network is trained using standard machine learning techniques. The resulting models make skillful predictions for the process rates when compared to the testing data. However, when solving the ordinary differential equations, the solutions are not as good as those of an established warm-rain parameterization. This deficiency can be seen as a limitation of the machine learning methods that are applied, but at the same time, it points toward a fundamental ill-posedness of the commonly used two-moment warm-rain schemes.

This study evaluates how well the most recent generation of climate models reproduces extratropical explosive cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere for the period 1980\textendash 2005. An objective-feature tracking algorithm is used to identify and track cyclones from 25 climate models and three reanalysis products. Model biases are compared to biases in the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, the polar jet stream, the Eady growth rate, and model resolution. Most models accurately reproduce the spatial distribution of explosive cyclones when compared to reanalysis data (R = 0.94), with high frequencies along the Kuroshio Current and the Gulf Stream. Three quarters of the models however significantly underpredict explosive cyclone frequencies, by a third on average and by two thirds in the worst case. This frequency bias is significantly correlated with jet stream speed in the inter-model spread (R \$\$\textbackslash ge\$\$0.51), which in the Atlantic is correlated with a negative meridional SST gradient (R = -0.56). The importance of the jet stream versus other variables considered in this study also applies to the interannual variability of explosive cyclone frequency. Furthermore, models with fewer explosive cyclones tend to underpredict the corresponding deepening rates (R \$\$\textbackslash ge\$\$0.88).

A time step of one month is used. The vertical variations of temperature, specific humidity, and the zonal and meridional components of the wind velocity are parameterized. The surface velocity components are obtained from modified forms of the first two equations of motion. The model includes variable snow and ice cover, meridional transport of heat and water vapor by mean and eddy atmospheric circulations, storage and transport of heat by the oceans, the effect of aerosols on atmospheric turbidity, and the contribution of H\textsubscript{2}O, CO\textsubscript{2}, O\textsubscript{3}, and clouds to the infrared balance.

  abstract = {In which direction is the influence larger: from the Arctic to the mid-latitudes or vice versa? To answer this question, CO2 concentrations have been regionally increased in different latitudinal belts, namely in the Arctic, in the northern mid-latitudes, everywhere outside of the Arctic and globally, in a series of 150~year coupled model experiments with the AWI Climate Model. This method is applied to allow a decomposition of the response to increasing CO2 concentrations in different regions. It turns out that CO2 increase applied in the Arctic only is very efficient in heating the Arctic and that the energy largely remains in the Arctic. In the first 30~years after switching on the CO2 forcing some robust atmospheric circulation changes, which are associated with the surface temperature anomalies including local cooling of up to 1~\textdegree C in parts of North America, are simulated. The synoptic activity is decreased in the mid-latitudes. Further into the simulation, surface temperature and atmospheric circulation anomalies become less robust. When quadrupling the CO2 concentration south of 60\textdegree{} N, the March Arctic sea ice volume is reduced by about two thirds in the 150~years of simulation time. When quadrupling the CO2 concentration between 30 and 60\textdegree{} N, the March Arctic sea ice volume is reduced by around one third, the same amount as if quadrupling CO2 north of 60\textdegree{} N. Both atmospheric and oceanic northward energy transport across 60\textdegree{} N are enhanced by up to 0.1 PW and 0.03 PW, respectively, and winter synoptic activity is increased over the Greenland, Norwegian, Iceland (GIN) seas. To a lesser extent the same happens when the CO2 concentration between 30 and 60\textdegree{} N is only increased to 1.65 times the reference value in order to consider the different size of the forcing areas. The increased northward energy transport, leads to Arctic sea ice reduction, and consequently Arctic amplification is present without Arctic CO2 forcing in all seasons but summer, independent of where the forcing is applied south of 60\textdegree{} N. South of the forcing area, both in the Arctic and northern mid-latitude forcing simulations, the warming is generally limited to less than 0.5~\textdegree C. In contrast, north of the forcing area in the northern mid-latitude forcing experiments, the warming amounts to generally more than 1~\textdegree C close to the surface, except for summer. This is a strong indication that the influence of warming outside of the Arctic on the Arctic is substantial, while forcing applied only in the Arctic mainly materializes in a warming Arctic, with relatively small implications for non-Arctic regions.},

In the Northern Hemisphere, effects on mean and heavy precipitation are also found in most models, but the results are less consistent than for temperature.

However, there is currently no consensus on estimates of the future mass balance of the ice sheet, primarily because of differences in the representation of physical processes, forcings employed and initial states of ice sheet models. This study presents results from ice flow model simulations from 13 international groups focusing on the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the period 2015\textendash 2100 as part of the Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison for CMIP6 (ISMIP6). They are forced with outputs from a subset of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), representative of the spread in climate model results. Simulations of the Antarctic ice sheet contribution to sea level rise in response to increased warming during this period varies between -7.8 and 30.0\&thinsp;cm of sea level equivalent (SLE) under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario forcing. These numbers are relative to a control experiment with constant climate conditions and should therefore be added to the mass loss contribution under climate conditions similar to present-day conditions over the same period. The simulated evolution of the West Antarctic ice sheet varies widely among models, with an overall mass loss, up to 18.0\&thinsp;cm\&thinsp;SLE, in response to changes in oceanic conditions. East Antarctica mass change varies between -6.1 and 8.3\&thinsp;cm\&thinsp;SLE in the simulations, with a significant increase in surface mass balance outweighing the increased ice discharge under most RCP 8.5 scenario forcings. The inclusion of ice shelf collapse, here assumed to be caused by large amounts of liquid water ponding at the surface of ice shelves, yields an additional simulated mass loss of 28\&thinsp;mm compared to simulations without ice shelf collapse. The largest sources of uncertainty come from the climate forcing, the ocean-induced melt rates, the calibration of these melt rates based on oceanic conditions taken outside of ice shelf cavities and the ice sheet dynamic response to these oceanic changes. Results under RCP 2.6 scenario based on two CMIP5 climate models show an additional mass loss of 0 and 3\&thinsp;cm of SLE on average compared to simulations done under present-day conditions for the two CMIP5 forcings used and display limited mass gain in East Antarctica.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Geographical and seasonal variations in cyclone and anticyclone frequencies, mean cyclone pressures and other cyclone characteristics are determined. Results, in general, compare favorably with those from earlier studies. The atmospheric circulation of the Arctic is characterized by strong seasonality, but with considerable year-to-year variability, evidenced through large-scale seasonal shifts in the position and intensity of cyclone and anticyclone frequency maxima, the types of systems comprising these pattern, and major cyclone tracks. In winter and spring, cyclonic activity is largely restricted to the eastern Arctic. Local frequency maxima are found near Svalbard, the northern tip of Novaya Zemlya, and, in winter, also near the Pole at about 90\textdegree E. The systems comprising these patterns are migratory, the majority entering store the North Atlantic and Barents Sea. Corresponding anticyclone frequency maxima occur within the Canada basin, in a broad zone from about 160\textdegree E to 140\textdegree W, extending up to 85\textdegree N. By contrast, the Canada basin in summer is the region of highest cyclone frequencies. Systems migrate into this region primarily from along the Siberian coast and subsequently stall, resulting in a persistent persistent of low pressure analogous to the Ieclandic low. This summer cyclone pattern is detailed in a case study. The summer anticyclone pattern consists of four distinct cells at about 78\textdegree N from 60\textdegree E to 150\textdegree W. Autumn is a transitional season, with cyclone frequency patterns similar to summer and winter, and anticyclone patterns similar to winter and spring.},

Results rely on output from a system detection and tracking algorithm applied to twice-daily National Meteorological Center sea level pressure fields. Winter peaks in cyclonic activity off the east coast of southern Greenland, over the Norwegian and Kara seas, Baffin Bay/Davis Strait, and south of Baffin Island are in general associated with frequent cyclogenesis and cyclolysis. The Atlantic side of the Arctic is the most synoptically active, characterized by a more frequent occurrence of deepening and larger mean latitude-adjusted maximum deepening rates, peaking at -6.8 mb (12 h-1) for the Greenland Sea/N. Atlantic sector. Average adjusted maximum deepening rates over continental areas and the ice-covered Arctic Ocean are less than -2 mb (12 h-1). The synoptically-active Atlantic Arctic is reflected in positive departures from zonal symmetry of mean 500-mb cyclonic vorticity advection, illustrating the stronger dynamical support along the North Atlantic cyclone track. Although mean maximum deepening rates for summer over continental regions and the Arctic Ocean are slightly greater than for winter, they decline elsewhere, with this change most pronounced for the Greenland Sea/N. Atlantic. This is reflected aloft in a decrease in the magnitude of 500-mb cyclonic vorticity advection. Cyclolysis now dominates the Atlantic side of the Arctic. By contrast, events of cyclogenesis and cyclolysis increase sharply over land, especially over Eurasia, contributing to local cyclone frequency maxima. A distinct summer cyclone maximum over the Arctic Ocean is confirmed as a region of essentially cyclolysis only, associated with the decay of systems migrating from the Eurasian coast as well as along the weaker North Atlantic track.},

The improved climatology is used to examine the accuracy of mean precipitation forecasts from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and European Reanalysis Agency (ERA) reanalysis models, based on data for the period 1979\textendash 88. Both models capture the major spatial features of annual mean precipitation and general aspects of the seasonal cycle but with some notable errors. Both underestimate precipitation over the Atlantic side of the Arctic. NCEP overestimates annual totals over land areas and to a somewhat lesser extent over the central Arctic Ocean. Except for the North Atlantic\textendash Scandinavia sector, the NCEP model also depicts the seasonal precipitation maximum consistently one month early in July. Overall, the ERA predictions are better. Both models perform best during winter and worst during summer.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The most significant problem with the NCEP model is a severe oversimulation of summer precipitation over land areas, due to excessive convective precipitation. Further investigation for July reveals that both the NCEP analyses and 12-h forecasts are too wet below about 850 mb and have more negative low-level temperature gradients as compared to available rawinsonde profiles. This suggests that low-level observations are not being effectively incorporated in the analyses. Given this finding, the high humidities are consistent with excessive surface evaporation rates. This problem may in turn relate to soil moisture, which NCEP updates by the modeled precipitation. If soil moisture is too high, this would favor excessive evaporation and high low-level humidities, fostering excessive precipitation, in turn keeping soil moisture and evaporation rates high. The NCEP downwelling shortwave fluxes are also much too high, contributing to excessive evaporation and possibly influencing the low-level temperature gradients. By comparison, soil moisture in the ERA model is adjusted using the difference between the model first guess and analysis value (the analysis increment) of low-level humidity, which prevents model drift. The ERA downwelling shortwave fluxes are also closer to observations. These attributes are consistent with the superior ERA precipitation forecasts in summer and suggest avenues for improving the performance of the NCEP model.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This disparity, combined with varying model projections of SAT change, and large variability in observed SAT over the 20th century, may lead one to question the concept of Arctic amplification. Disparity is greatly reduced, however, if one compares observed trajectories to near-future simulations (2010\textendash 2029), rather than to the doubled-CO2 or late 21st century conditions that are typically cited. These near-future simulations document a preconditioning phase of Arctic amplification, characterized by the initial retreat and thinning of sea ice, with imprints of low-frequency variability. Observations show these same basic features, but with SATs over the Arctic Ocean still largely constrained by the insulating effects of the ice cover and thermal inertia of the upper ocean. Given the general consistency with model projections, we are likely near the threshold when absorption of solar radiation during summer limits ice growth the following autumn and winter, initiating a feedback leading to a substantial increase in Arctic Ocean SATs.},

Assessment of the atmospheric budget relies primarily on the ERA-40 reanalysis. The seasonal cycles of vertically integrated atmospheric energy storage and the convergence of energy transport from ERA-40, as evaluated for the polar cap (defined by the 70\textdegree N latitude circle), in general compare well with realizations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis over the period 1979\textendash 2001. However, shortcomings in top of atmosphere radiation, as compared to satellite data, and the net surface flux, contribute to large energy budget residuals in ERA-40. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric energy storage is strongly modulated by the net surface flux, which is also the primary driver of seasonal changes in heat storage within the Arctic Ocean. Averaged for an Arctic Ocean domain, the July net surface flux from ERA-40 of -100 W m-2 (i.e., into the ocean), associated with sea ice melt and oceanic sensible heat gain, exceeds the atmospheric energy transport convergence of 91 W m-2. During winter (for which budget residuals are large), oceanic sensible heat loss and sea ice growth yield an upward surface flux of 50\textendash 60 W m-2, complemented with an atmospheric energy convergence of 80\textendash 90 W m-2 to provide a net radiation loss to space of 175\textendash 180 W m-2.},

Concurrently, detailed analyses for several individual monsoons indicate a redistribution of rainfall from early to late in the rainy season. This analysis examines CMIP5 projected changes in the annual cycle of precipitation in monsoon regions, using a moist static energy framework to evaluate competing mechanisms identified to be important in precipitation changes over land. In the presence of sufficient surface moisture, the local response to the increase in downwelling energy is characterized by increased evaporation, increased low-level moist static energy, and decreased stability with consequent increases in precipitation. A remote mechanism begins with warmer oceans and operates on land regions via a warmer tropical troposphere, increased stability, and decreased precipitation. The remote mechanism controls the projected changes during winter, and the local mechanism controls the switch to increased precipitation during summer in most monsoon regions. During the early summer transition, regions where boundary layer moisture availability is reduced owing to decreases in evaporation and moisture convergence experience an enhanced convective barrier. Regions characterized by adequate evaporation and moisture convergence do not experience reductions in early summer precipitation.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}This enhanced convective barrier leads to a redistribution of rainfall from early to late summer, and is robust in the American and African monsoons but muddled in Asia.

Contrary to the long-term SPG warming trend evidenced by most of the models, 17.5\% of the models (7/40) project a rapid SPG cooling, consistent with a collapse of the local deep-ocean convection. Uncertainty in projections is associated with the models' varying capability in simulating the present-day SPG stratification, whose realistic reproduction appears a necessary condition for the onset of a convection collapse. This event occurs in 45.5\% of the 11 models best able to simulate the observed SPG stratification. Thus, due to systematic model biases, the CMIP5 ensemble as a whole underestimates the chance of future abrupt SPG cooling, entailing crucial implications for observation and adaptation policy.},

The weak storm track is consistent with the decreased meridional gradient of evaporation and atmospheric shortwave absorption and can be predicted following global mean cooling and the Clausius-Clapeyron relation. The weak storm track is also consistent with decreased latent heat release aloft in the tropics, which decreases upper tropospheric baroclinicity and mean available potential energy.

Consistent with previous work, ocean direct radiative forcing decreases ocean-averaged outgoing longwave radiation, precipitation, and tropical circulation intensity; however, it cannot explain the regional response to direct radiative forcing. Increased CO2 over land dominates the regional response via energy input over land, e.g., over deserts where there is no cloud and water vapor masking and a Rossby wave teleconnection.

The mechanisms are grouped according to their thermodynamic starting point, which are thought to arise from processes independent of the zonal mean mid-latitude circulation response.

Imposed sea ice loss (difference without and with sea ice with historical CO2 concentration) leads to global warming, polar amplified warming, and a weakening of poleward atmospheric energy transport and the midlatitude storm-track intensity. The simulations confirm an energetic mechanism that predicts a weakening of storm-track intensity in response to sea ice loss, given the change of surface albedo and assuming a passive ocean. Namely, sea ice loss increases the absorption of shortwave radiation by the surface (following the decrease of surface albedo), which increases surface turbulent fluxes into the atmosphere thereby weakening poleward atmospheric energy transport. The storm-track intensity weakens because it dominates poleward energy transport. The quantitative prediction underlying the mechanism captures the weakening but underestimates its amplitude. The weakening is also consistent with weaker mean available potential energy (polar amplified warming) and scales with sea ice extent, which is controlled by the slab-ocean depth. The energetic mechanism also operates in response to sea ice loss due to melting (difference of the response to quadrupled CO2 with and without sea ice). Finally, the midlatitude response to sea ice loss in the aquaplanet agrees qualitatively with the response in more complex climate models. Namely, the storm-track intensity weakens and the energetic mechanism operates, but the method used to impose sea ice loss in coupled models impacts the surface response.},

In reanalysis data, the winter-to-summer transition involves the growth of planetary-scale wave latent heat and momentum transports in the region of monsoons and anticyclones that dominate over the zonal-mean transport beginning in midspring. The wave-dominated regime coincides with an abrupt northward expansion of the cross-equatorial circulation and reversal of the trade winds. In the upper troposphere, the transition coincides with the growth of cross-equatorial planetary-scale wave momentum transport and a poleward shift of subplanetary-scale wave transport and jet stream.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The dynamics of the seasonal transition are captured by idealized aquaplanet model simulations with a prescribed subtropical planetary-scale wave sea surface temperature (SST) perturbation. The SST perturbation generates subtropical planetary-scale wave streamfunction variance and transport in the lower and upper troposphere consistent with quasigeostrophic theory. Beyond a threshold SST, a transition of the zonal-mean circulation occurs, which coincides with a localized reversal of absolute vorticity in the NH tropical upper troposphere. The transition is abrupt in the lower troposphere because of the quadratic dependence of the wave transport on the SST perturbation and involves seasonal-time-scale feedbacks between the wave and zonal-mean flow in the upper troposphere, including cross-equatorial wave propagation. The zonal-mean vertical and meridional flows associated with the circulation response are in balance with the planetary-scale wave momentum and latent heat meridional flux divergences. The results highlight the leading-order role of monsoon\textendash anticyclone transport in the seasonal transition, including its impact on the meridional extent of the Hadley and Ferrel cells.

Here we test latitudinally dependent explanations of the circulation response to increased CO2 using slab ocean aquaplanet models with latitudinally dependent CO2 concentration. Quadrupling CO2 in the tropics (0\textendash 20\textdegree ) accounts for the strengthening and upward shift of the subtropical jet but does not account for the poleward shift of the Hadley cell edge or extratropical circulation. The tropical response is dominated by regions of descent. When CO2 is quadrupled in high latitudes (60\textendash 90\textdegree ), there is a negligible circulation response. The response to latitudinally dependent increased CO2 is mostly linear and increased CO2 in the midlatitudes (20\textendash 60\textdegree ) dominates. Within the midlatitudes, the subtropics (20\textendash 40\textdegree ) dominate.

In state-of-the-art climate models, the average response of the Asian monsoon cyclone, Pacific ocean anticyclone and jet stream to global warming is weak and responses of different models are diverse. Here we use a suite of simulations with atmospheric general circulation models with prescribed sea surface temperatures to separate the circulation responses to direct radiative forcing and indirect sea surface temperature warming. We find that the two contributions oppose each other. Using idealized aquaplanet simulations, we show that the different circulation responses are directly connected to the opposite responses of land\textendash sea thermal contrast to the two forcing components. This tug of war on the circulation response to global warming is analogous to the seasonal response to insolation, which involves opposite land\textendash sea thermal contrasts and circulation patterns governed by quasi-equilibrium thermodynamics and stationary-wave dynamics. We conclude that it is important to distinguish weak circulation responses to global warming that arise owing to compensating effects that are robust and physically understood from those that are associated with genuine uncertainty. We note that compensation places fundamental limits on the detection and attribution of circulation responses to global warming.},

Here moist thermodynamic and dynamic frameworks are combined to make predictions of circulation responses to warming. We show Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) scaling of specific humidity with warming predicts an expansion of the Hadley circulation according to convective quasi-equilibrium dynamics. A poleward jet shift follows from the control-climate relationship between the Hadley cell edge and jet stream position. CC scaling of specific humidity with warming also predicts decreased diffusivity and a poleward shift of the latitude of maximum latent and dry static energy transport according to mixing-length theory. Finally, atmospheric cloud radiative changes shift the latitude of maximum energy transport poleward in most models. Our results show moist thermodynamics can predict meridional shifts of the circulation when combined with dynamical frameworks; however, additional feedbacks are important for the simulated response.},

  abstract = {Abstract Lateral stirring is a basic oceanographic phenomenon affecting the distribution of physical, chemical, and biological fields. Eddy stirring at scales on the order of 100 km (the mesoscale) is fairly well understood and explicitly represented in modern eddy-resolving numerical models of global ocean circulation. The same cannot be said for smaller-scale stirring processes. Here, the authors describe a major oceanographic field experiment aimed at observing and understanding the processes responsible for stirring at scales of 0.1\textendash 10 km. Stirring processes of varying intensity were studied in the Sargasso Sea eddy field approximately 250 km southeast of Cape Hatteras. Lateral variability of water-mass properties, the distribution of microscale turbulence, and the evolution of several patches of inert dye were studied with an array of shipboard, autonomous, and airborne instruments. Observations were made at two sites, characterized by weak and moderate background mesoscale straining, to contrast different regimes of lateral stirring. Analyses to date suggest that, in both cases, the lateral dispersion of natural and deliberately released tracers was O(1) m2 s\textendash 1 as found elsewhere, which is faster than might be expected from traditional shear dispersion by persistent mesoscale flow and linear internal waves. These findings point to the possible importance of kilometer-scale stirring by submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal-wave processes or the need to modify the traditional shear-dispersion paradigm to include higher-order effects. A unique aspect of the Scalable Lateral Mixing and Coherent Turbulence (LatMix) field experiment is the combination of direct measurements of dye dispersion with the concurrent multiscale hydrographic and turbulence observations, enabling evaluation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed dispersion at a new level.},

  abstract = {Abstract Two theoretical frameworks have been widely used to understand the response of monsoons to local and remote forcings: the vertically integrated atmospheric energy budget and convective quasi-equilibrium (CQE). Existing forms of these frameworks neglect some of the complexities of monsoons, such as the shallow meridional circulations that advect dry air from adjacent deserts into the middle and lower troposphere of monsoon regions. Here the fidelity of energy budget and CQE theories for monsoon location is assessed in a three-dimensional beta-plane model with boundary conditions representative of an off-equatorial continent with a tropical grassland and an adjacent subtropical desert. Energy budget theories show mixed success for various SST and land surface albedo forcings, with the ITCZ being collocated with the energy flux equator but a nonmonotonic relationship existing between ITCZ latitude and cross-equatorial energy transport. Accounting for the off-equatorial position of the unperturbed energy flux equator is shown to be important when a linearization of meridional energy transports is used to quantitatively diagnose ITCZ location. CQE theories that diagnose ITCZ location based on the subcloud moist static energy maximum are shown to have large biases; accounting for convective entrainment of dry air by using a lower-tropospheric mean moist static energy provides a more correct diagnosis of ITCZ location. Finally, it is shown that although ITCZ shifts can be diagnosed by modified CQE and energy budget frameworks, neither can be used in a quantitatively prognostic capacity because of unpredictable feedbacks that are often larger than the imposed forcing.},

TW never exceeds 31 \textdegree C. Any exceedence of 35 \textdegree C for extended periods should induce hyperthermia in humans and other mammals, as dissipation of metabolic heat becomes impossible. While this never happens now, it would begin to occur with global-mean warming of about 7 \textdegree C, calling the habitability of some regions into question. With 11\textendash 12 \textdegree C warming, such regions would spread to encompass the majority of the human population as currently distributed. Eventual warmings of 12 \textdegree C are possible from fossil fuel burning. One implication is that recent estimates of the costs of unmitigated climate change are too low unless the range of possible warming can somehow be narrowed. Heat stress also may help explain trends in the mammalian fossil record.},

  abstract = {We assess evidence relevant to Earth's equilibrium climate sensitivity per doubling of atmospheric CO2, characterized by an effective sensitivity S. This evidence includes feedback process understanding, the historical climate record, and the paleoclimate record. An S value lower than 2 K is difficult to reconcile with any of the three lines of evidence. The amount of cooling during the Last Glacial Maximum provides strong evidence against values of S greater than 4.5 K. Other lines of evidence in combination also show that this is relatively unlikely. We use a Bayesian approach to produce a probability density function (PDF) for S given all the evidence, including tests of robustness to difficult-to-quantify uncertainties and different priors. The 66\% range is 2.6\textendash 3.9 K for our Baseline calculation and remains within 2.3\textendash 4.5 K under the robustness tests; corresponding 5\textendash 95\% ranges are 2.3\textendash 4.7 K, bounded by 2.0\textendash 5.7 K (although such high-confidence ranges should be regarded more cautiously). This indicates a stronger constraint on S than reported in past assessments, by lifting the low end of the range. This narrowing occurs because the three lines of evidence agree and are judged to be largely independent and because of greater confidence in understanding feedback processes and in combining evidence. We identify promising avenues for further narrowing the range in S, in particular using comprehensive models and process understanding to address limitations in the traditional forcing-feedback paradigm for interpreting past changes.},

Clim. 21 5336\textendash 52). This method, in effect, performs a multiple linear regression of the data onto a structural model that includes both natural variability, trends, and time-changing instrument biases, thereby avoiding estimation biases inherent in traditional homogenization methods. One modification now enables homogenized winds to be provided for the first time. This, and several other small modifications made to the original method sometimes affect results at individual stations, but do not strongly affect broad-scale temperature trends. Temperature trends in the updated data show three noteworthy features. First, tropical warming is equally strong over both the 1959\textendash 2012 and 1979\textendash 2012 periods, increasing smoothly and almost moist-adiabatically from the surface (where it is roughly 0.14 K/decade) to 300 hPa (where it is about 0.25 K/decade over both periods), a pattern very close to that in climate model predictions. This contradicts suggestions that atmospheric warming has slowed in recent decades or that it has not kept up with that at the surface. Second, as shown in previous studies, tropospheric warming does not reach quite as high in the tropics and subtropics as predicted in typical models. Third, cooling has slackened in the stratosphere such that linear trends since 1979 are about half as strong as reported earlier for shorter periods. Wind trends over the period 1979\textendash 2012 confirm a strengthening, lifting and poleward shift of both subtropical westerly jets; the Northern one shows more displacement and the southern more intensification, but these details appear sensitive to the time period analysed. There is also a trend toward more easterly winds in the middle and upper troposphere of the deep tropics.},

In this model overshooting convective turrets inject dehydrated tropospheric air into a tropical ``tropopause layer'' (TTL) bounded approximately by the 50- and 150-hPa surfaces, a layer similar to the ``entrainment zone'' at the top of the planetary boundary layer. The overshooting process occurs only in limited regions. In the TTL, mixtures of overshooting and ambient air undergo buoyancy-driven settling, then slowly loft through the TTL and eventually enter the main stratosphere throughout the Tropics. It is found that for reasonable parameter settings the combined action of convection, isentropic mixing, and advection by the large-scale circulation in the model can produce realistic water vapor and ozone profiles while balancing the energy budget. Some of the observed peculiarities that can be simulated are (i) the widespread absence of vapor saturation at the tropopause despite tropical mean upward motion, (ii) an ozone minimum below the mean tropopause, and (iii) the typical location of stratiform cloud tops below the mean tropopause. In contrast to inferences from typical ``cold trap'' models, the relative humidity of air crossing the tropopause is found to be sensitive to ice microphysics.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Key climate feedback due to water vapor and clouds rest largely on how relative humidity {$\mathscr{R}$} changes in a warmer climate, yet this has not been extensively analyzed in models. General circulation models (GCMs) from the CMIP3 archive and several higher-resolution atmospheric GCMs examined here generally predict a characteristic pattern of {$\mathscr{R}$} trend with global temperature that has been reported previously in individual models, including increase around the tropopause, decrease in the tropical upper troposphere, and decrease in midlatitudes. This pattern is very similar to that previously reported for cloud cover in the same GCMs, confirming the role of {$\mathscr{R}$} in controlling changes in simulated cloud. Comparing different models, the trend in each part of the troposphere is approximately proportional to the upward and/or poleward gradient of {$\mathscr{R}$} in the present climate. While this suggests that the changes simply reflect a shift of the {$\mathscr{R}$} pattern upward with the tropopause and poleward with the zonal jets, the drying trend in the subtropics is roughly 3 times too large to be attributable to shifts of subtropical features, and the subtropical {$\mathscr{R}$} minima deepen in most models. {$\mathscr{R}$} trends are correlated with horizontal model resolution, especially outside the tropics, where they show signs of convergence and latitudinal gradients become close to available observations for GCM resolutions near T85 and higher. We argue that much of the systematic change in {$\mathscr{R}$} can be explained by the local specific humidity having been set (by condensation) in remote regions with different temperature changes, hence the gradients and trends each depend on a model's ability to resolve moisture transport. Finally, subtropical drying trends predicted from the warming alone fall well short of those observed in recent decades. While this discrepancy supports previous reports of GCMs underestimating Hadley cell expansion, our results imply that shifts alone are not a sufficient interpretation of changes.},

Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

A theory appears to be in place to predict humidity in the free troposphere if winds are known at large scales, providing a crucial link between small-scale behavior and large-scale mass and energy constraints. This, along with observations, supports the anticipated water vapor feedback on climate, though key uncertainties remain connected to atmospheric dynamics and the hydrological consequences of a moister atmosphere. More work is called for to understand how circulations on all scales are governed and what role water vapor plays. Suggestions are given for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ocean uptake of anthropogenic heat over the past 15 years has mostly occurred in the Southern Ocean, based on Argo float observations. This agrees with historical simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), where the Southern Ocean (south of 30\textdegree S) accounts for 72\% {$\pm$} 28\% of global heat uptake, while the contribution from the North Atlantic north of 30\textdegree N is only 6\%. Aerosols preferentially cool the Northern Hemisphere, and the effect on surface heat flux over the subpolar North Atlantic opposes the greenhouse gas (GHG) effect in nearly equal magnitude. This heat uptake compensation is associated with weakening (strengthening) of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in response to GHG (aerosol) radiative forcing. Aerosols are projected to decline in the near future, reinforcing the greenhouse effect on the North Atlantic heat uptake. As a result, the Southern Ocean, which will continue to take up anthropogenic heat largely through the mean upwelling of water from depth, will be joined by increased relative contribution from the North Atlantic because of substantial AMOC slowdown in the twenty-first century. In the RCP8.5 scenario, the percentage contribution to global uptake is projected to decrease to 48\% {$\pm$} 8\% in the Southern Ocean and increase to 26\% {$\pm$} 6\% in the northern North Atlantic. Despite the large uncertainty in the magnitude of projected aerosol forcing, our results suggest that anthropogenic aerosols, given their geographic distributions and temporal trajectories, strongly influence the high-latitude ocean heat uptake and interhemispheric asymmetry through AMOC change.},

  abstract = {Previous studies suggest large uncertainties in the stationary wave response under global warming. Here, we investigate how the Arctic climate responds to changes in the latitudinal position of stationary waves, and to high-latitudes surface warming that mimics the effect of Arctic sea ice loss under global warming. To generate stationary waves in an atmospheric model coupled to slab ocean, a series of experiments is performed where the thermal forcing with a zonal wavenumber-2 (with zero zonal-mean) is prescribed at the surface at different latitude bands in the Northern Hemisphere. When the stationary waves are generated in the subtropics, the cooling response dominates over the warming response in the lower troposphere due to cloud radiative effects. Then, the low-level baroclinicity is reduced in the subtropics, which gives rise to a poleward shift of the eddy driven jet, thereby inducing substantial cooling in the northern high latitudes. As the stationary waves are progressively generated at higher latitudes, the zonal-mean climate state gradually becomes more similar to the integration with no stationary waves. These differences in the mean climate affect the Arctic climate response to high-latitudes surface warming. Additional surface heating over the Arctic is imposed to the reference climates in which the stationary waves are located at different latitude bands. When the stationary waves are positioned at lower latitudes, the eddy driven jet is located at higher latitude, closer to the prescribed Arctic heating. As baroclinicity is more effectively perturbed, the jet shifts more equatorward that accompanies a larger reduction in the poleward eddy transport of heat and momentum. A stronger eddy-induced descending motion creates greater warming over the Arctic. Our study calls for a more accurate simulation of the present-day stationary wave pattern to enhance the predictability of the Arctic warming response in a changing climate.},

Explicit account is taken of the effect of cloud optical thickness and multiple reflections between the surface and cloud base. Using simple two-stream theory, a theoretical form for the flux is proposed, and then results from a detailed radiative transfer scheme are used to determine the values of a number of empirical coefficients. Over a range of cosines of the solar zenith angle from 0.1 to 0.7, of cloud optical thickness from 1.8 to 20 and of surface albedo from 0.0 to 0.9, the empirical equation reproduces results from the radiative transfer scheme to within 2.7\%, and is shown to perform well outside the range of fit. The method was derived with high latitudes in mind but is applicable generally. It is shown that the spectral properties of snow and ice surfaces play an important role in surface net flux prediction. For totally overcast skies the influence of cloud height and atmospheric water vapour content are shown to be minor. Finally, for clear skies, an empirical equation due to J. W. Zillman is investigated and by adjustments to his coefficients, is brought into good agreement with the detailed calculations described here.},

The main emphasis of the paper is on the testing of the model sensitivity to changes in surface albedo parameterization. Climatologies of turbulent and long-wave fluxes in the Arctic are scarce, and those that exist are shown to generate significant differences in the predicted ice thickness. There is considerable disagreement in the literature on albedo values, and in particular, proposed albedos of bare, puddled ice range from 0.4 to 0.66. The differences among published model simulations are shown to be potentially explicable in terms of this range in bare ice albedo. A new ice albedo parameterization is proposed, and its sensitivity is tested. It is shown that the increase in surface albedo with cloud cover can cause a doubling of the ice thickness, and the need to include melting snow as an albedo class distinct from dry snow is demonstrated. The value of bare-ice albedo is shown to be important in determining whether the ice is in a multiyear or a seasonal ice zone, and the need for more observational data on the extent and role of melt puddles is emphasized.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study examines the temporal evolution of the extratropically forced tropical response in an idealized aquaplanet model under equinox condition. We apply a surface thermal forcing in the northern extratropics that oscillates periodically in time. It is shown that tropical precipitation is unaltered by sufficiently high-frequency extratropical forcing. This sensitivity to the extratropical forcing periodicity arises from the critical time required for sea surface temperature (SST) adjustment. Low-frequency extratropical forcing grants sufficient time for atmospheric transient eddies to diffuse moist static energy to perturb the mid-latitude SSTs outside the forcing region, as demonstrated by a one-dimensional energy balance model with a fixed diffusivity. As the transient eddies weaken in the subtropics, a further equatorward advection is accomplished by the Hadley circulation. The essential role of Hadley cell advection in connecting the subtropical signal to the equatorial region is supported by an idealized thermodynamical-advective model. Associated with the SST changes in the tropics is a meridional shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. Since the time needed for SST adjustment increases with increasing mixed layer depth, the critical forcing period at which the extratropical forcing can affect the tropics scales linearly with the mixed layer depth. Our results highlight the important role of decadal-and-longer extratropical climate variability in shaping the tropical climate system. We also raise the possibility that the transient behavior of a tropical response forced by extratropical variability may be strongly dependent on cloud radiative effects.},

Here, we show that the classic, shallow-water Matsuno-Gill solutions do not exhibit equatorial superrotation: although the flow converges westerly momentum from high latitudes to the equator\textemdash promoting superrotation\textemdash they also contain an artificial source of easterly momentum at the equator that cancels the latitudinal momentum convergence and prevents superrotation from emerging. This artificial momentum source results from a physically inconsistent representation of vertical momentum transport in the model. We show that if the Matsuno-Gill model is modified to properly account for momentum exchange with an underlying quiescent layer, the solutions naturally exhibit equatorial superrotation, at any forcing amplitude.},

A brief review of the energy and potential vorticity arguments that form the basis of the eddy straining hypothesis is presented. It was suggested that traveling cyclone-scale eddies approaching a split-jetstream flow pattern suffer a greater rate of deformation than when in a more typical flow field and that this provides an enhanced energy cascade. It is found that from a potential vorticity viewpoint, the east\textendash west scale compression corresponds to an irreversible cascade of potential entropy to smaller scales and ultimately dissipation. It is found that when the meridional wavelength is long, the time spent by a parcel of air in any phase of the eddy is inversely proportional to its zonal wavelength according to the classical Rossby formula.

This change is often interpreted through the lens of the atmospheric energy budget, in which the increase in global precipitation is mostly offset by an increase in net radiative cooling. Other studies have provided different interpretations from the perspective of the surface, where evaporation represents the turbulent transfer of latent heat to the atmosphere. Expanding on this surface perspective, here we derive a version of the Penman\textendash Monteith equation that allows the change in ocean evaporation to be partitioned into a thermodynamic response to surface warming, and additional diagnostic contributions from changes in surface radiation, ocean heat uptake, and boundary-layer dynamics/relative humidity. In this framework, temperature is found to be the primary control on the rate of increase in global precipitation within model simulations of greenhouse gas warming, while the contributions from changes in surface radiation and ocean heat uptake are found to be secondary. The temperature contribution also dominates the spatial pattern of global evaporation change, leading to the largest fractional increases at high latitudes. In the surface energy budget, the thermodynamic increase in evaporation comes at the expense of the sensible heat flux, while radiative changes cause the sensible heat flux to increase. These tendencies on the sensible heat flux partly offset each other, resulting in a relatively small change in the global mean, and contributing to an impression that global precipitation is radiatively constrained.},

The climate model simulations agree reasonably with ERA-40 in the present climate (1961\textendash 2000). Under the influence of atmospheric blocking, a decrease in the 0.95th quantiles of extreme minimum temperatures can be distinguished.

In a climatological sense, Arctic cyclone behaviour is linked to the distributions of lower troposphere temperature and sea ice, and hence the monitoring of storms can be seen as an important component of the analysis of Arctic climate. The analysis of cyclone behaviour, however, is not without ambiguity, and different cyclone identification algorithms can lead to divergent conclusions. Here we analyse a subset of Arctic cyclones with 10 state-of-the-art cyclone identification schemes applied to the ERA-Interim reanalysis. The subset is comprised of the five most intense (defined in terms of central pressure) Arctic cyclones for each of the 12 calendar months over the 30-yr period from 1 January 1979 to 31 March 2009. There is a considerable difference between the central pressures diagnosed by the algorithms of typically 5\textendash 10 hPa. By contrast, there is substantial agreement as to the location of the centre of these extreme storms. The cyclone tracking algorithms also display some differences in the evolution and life cycle of these storms, while overall finding them to be quite long-lived. For all but six of the 60 storms an intense tropopause polar vortex is identified within 555 km of the surface system. The results presented here highlight some significant differences between the outputs of the algorithms, and hence point to the value using multiple identification schemes in the study of cyclone behaviour. Overall, however, the algorithms reached a very robust consensus on most aspects of the behaviour of these very extreme cyclones in the Arctic basin.},

  abstract = {Abstract An emergent constraint (EC) is a statistical relationship, across a model ensemble, between a measurable aspect of the present-day climate (the predictor) and an aspect of future projected climate change (the predictand). If such a relationship is robust and understood, it may provide constrained projections for the real world. Here, models from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) are used to revisit several ECs that were proposed in prior model intercomparisons with two aims: 1) to assess whether these ECs survive the partial out-of-sample test of CMIP6 and 2) to more rigorously quantify the constrained projected change than previous studies. To achieve the latter, methods are proposed whereby uncertainties can be appropriately accounted for, including the influence of internal variability, uncertainty on the linear relationship, and the uncertainty associated with model structural differences, aside from those described by the EC. Both least squares regression and a Bayesian hierarchical model are used. Three ECs are assessed: (i) the relationship between Southern Hemisphere jet latitude and projected jet shift, which is found to be a robust and quantitatively useful constraint on future projections; (ii) the relationship between stationary wave amplitude in the Pacific\textendash North American sector and meridional wind changes over North America (with extensions to hydroclimate), which is found to be robust but improvements in the predictor in CMIP6 result in it no longer substantially constraining projected change in either circulation or hydroclimate; and (iii) the relationship between ENSO teleconnections to California and California precipitation change, which does not appear to be robust when using historical ENSO teleconnections as the predictor.},

Here, CESM2's representation of the large-scale atmospheric circulation and its variability is assessed. Further context is providedthrough comparison to the CESM1 large ensemble and other models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). This includes an assessment of the representation of jet streams and storm tracks, stationary waves, the global divergent circulation, the annular modes, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and blocking. Compared to CESM1, CESM2 is substantially improved in the representation of the storm tracks, Northern Hemisphere (NH) stationary waves, NH winter blocking and the global divergent circulation. It ranks within the top 10\% of CMIP class models in many of these features. Some features of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) circulation have degraded, such as the SH jet strength, stationary waves, and blocking, although the SH jet stream is placed at approximately the correct location. This analysis also highlights systematic deficiencies in these features across the new CMIP6 archive, such as the continued tendency for the SH jet stream to be placed too far equatorward, the North Atlantic westerlies to be too strong over Europe, the storm tracks as measured by low-level meridional wind variance to be too weak and a lack of blocking in the North Atlantic sector.},

It is found that almost all models exhibit multidecadal jet stream variability that is entirely consistent with the sampling of white noise year-to-year atmospheric fluctuations. In the observed record, the variability displays a pronounced seasonality within the winter months, with greatly enhanced variability toward the late winter. This late winter variability exceeds that found in any GCM and greatly exceeds expectations from the sampling of atmospheric noise, motivating the need for an underlying explanation. The potential roles of both external forcings and internal coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere processes are considered. While the late winter variability is not found to be closely connected with external forcing, it is found to be strongly related to the internally generated component of Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). In fact, consideration of the seasonality of the jet stream variability within the winter months reveals that the AMV is far more strongly connected to jet stream variability during March than the early winter months or the winter season as a whole. Reasoning is put forward for why this connection likely represents a driving of the jet stream variability by the SSTs, although the dynamics involved remain to be understood. This analysis reveals a fundamental mismatch between late winter jet stream variability in observations and GCMs and a potential source of long-term predictability of the late winter Atlantic atmospheric circulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract A simplified general circulation model has been used to investigate the chain of causality whereby changes in tropospheric circulation and temperature are produced in response to stratospheric heating perturbations. Spinup ensemble experiments have been performed to examine the evolution of the tropospheric circulation in response to such perturbations. The primary aim of these experiments is to investigate the possible mechanisms whereby a tropospheric response to changing solar activity over the 11-yr solar cycle could be produced in response to heating of the equatorial lower stratosphere. This study therefore focuses on a stratospheric heating perturbation in which the heating is largest in the tropics. For comparison, experiments are also performed in which the stratosphere is heated uniformly at all latitudes and in which it is heated preferentially in the polar region. Thus, the mechanisms discussed have a wider relevance for the impact of stratospheric perturbations on the troposphere. The results demonstrate the importance of changing eddy momentum fluxes in driving the tropospheric response. This is confirmed by the lack of a similar response in a zonally symmetric model with fixed eddy forcing. Furthermore, it is apparent that feedback between the tropospheric eddy fluxes and tropospheric circulation changes is required to produce the full model response. The quasigeostrophic index of refraction is used to diagnose the cause of the changes in eddy behavior. It is demonstrated that the latitudinal extent of stratospheric heating is important in determining the direction of displacement of the tropospheric jet and storm track.},

From the results of upper air observations approximate values of the temperature and water content of the atmosphere at all heights and in all latitudes are adopted. Knowing the amount of water vapour and the temperature, it is possible to calculate the outgoing radiation if the absorption coefficient of water vapour is known. From consideration of the temperature of the upper stratosphere it is found that one millimetre of precipitable water in vapour form absorbs 30 per cent of the incident long wave radiation. With this value for the absorption coefficient the total outgoing radiation is calculated for each latitude from the equator to the pole, and it is found that over three-quarters of the earth's surface\textemdash from the equator to latitude 50\textdegree\textemdash the outgoing radiation is uniform and independent of the temperature of the surface. This result is due to the fact that it is only the layers of the atmosphere whose temperature lies between 220d and 286d which contribute to the outgoing radiation. As these layers are well within the troposphere between the equator and latitude 50\textdegree, the outgoing radiation is uniform from 50\textdegree S to 50\textdegree N. At higher latitudes the radiation falls off slightly, and at the pole itself it is 20 per cent below its value-at the equator. As the outgoing radiation is practically independent of the temperature of the surface, the problem arises as to how the temperature of the atmosphere readjusts itself to changes in solar radiation. This problem is considered in detail, but no solution is found.},

  abstract = {Abstract Clouds cover on average nearly 70\% of Earth's surface and regulate the global albedo. The magnitude of the shortwave reflection by clouds depends on their location, optical properties, and three-dimensional (3D) structure. Due to computational limitations, Earth system models are unable to perform 3D radiative transfer calculations. Instead they make assumptions, including the independent column approximation (ICA), that neglect effects of 3D cloud morphology on albedo. We show how the resulting radiative flux bias (ICA-3D) depends on cloud morphology and solar zenith angle. We use high-resolution (20\textendash 100-m horizontal resolution) large-eddy simulations to produce realistic 3D cloud fields covering three dominant regimes of low-latitude clouds: shallow cumulus, marine stratocumulus, and deep convective cumulonimbus. A Monte Carlo code is used to run 3D and ICA broadband radiative transfer calculations; we calculate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflected flux and surface irradiance biases as functions of solar zenith angle for these three cloud regimes. Finally, we use satellite observations of cloud water path (CWP) climatology, and the robust correlation between CWP and TOA flux bias in our LES sample, to roughly estimate the impact of neglecting 3D cloud radiative effects on a global scale. We find that the flux bias is largest at small zenith angles and for deeper clouds, while the albedo bias is most prominent for large zenith angles. In the tropics, the annual-mean shortwave radiative flux bias is estimated to be 3.1 {$\pm$} 1.6 W m-2, reaching as much as 6.5 W m-2 locally.},

The polar climate impact of this evolving ocean response to CO2 forcing is then isolated using slab ocean experiments in a state-of-the-art climate model. Overall, feedbacks over the Southern Hemisphere more effectively dissipate top-of-atmosphere anomalies than those over the Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, a poleward shift in ocean heat convergence in both hemispheres amplifies destabilizing ice albedo and lapse rate feedbacks over the Arctic much more so than over the Antarctic. These results suggest that the Arctic is intrinsically more sensitive to both CO2 and oceanic forcings than the Antarctic and that ocean-driven climate sensitivity asymmetry arises from feedback destabilization over the Arctic rather than feedback stabilization over the Antarctic.},

A plume model approximately reproduces the increases in updraught velocities if the plume environment is prescribed as the mean profile in each simulation while holding the entrainment and microphysical assumptions fixed. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) also increases with warming in the simulations but at a much faster fractional rate when compared with the square of the updraught velocities. This discrepancy is investigated with a two-plume model in which a weakly entraining plume represents the most intense updraughts, and the environment is assumed to adjust so that a more strongly entraining plume has negligible buoyancy. The two-plume model suggests that updraught velocities increase with warming at a lower fractional rate than implied by the CAPE because of the influence of entrainment on both the mean stratification and the updraughts themselves.},

The model is based on a bulk-plume representation of convection, and it is coupled to the large-scale circulation using methods developed for limited-area numerical models that are consistent with the weak temperature gradient approximation. Given the mid-tropospheric temperature anomaly in the ascent region, the model solves for the profiles of temperature, relative humidity, and large-scale vertical velocity in this region, as well as the tropical-mean profiles of temperature and relative humidity, as a function of two parameters representing the importance of entrainment and condensate reevaporation in moist convection. According to the simple model, the ascent region is characterized by an anomalously moist and stable free troposphere with a top-heavy vertical velocity profile that peaks in the upper troposphere. These results are shown to be consistent with simulations using a cloud-system resolving model in which the large-scale circulation is parameterized. Furthermore, it is shown that, due to the effect of entrainment on the tropospheric lapse rate, the predicted vertical velocity profile is more top heavy than the first-baroclinic mode profile used in previous reduced-complexity models of tropical dynamics. The simple model therefore provides a framework to link mixing and microphysical processes in moist convection to the large-scale structure of the tropical overturning circulation.},

In this paper, we investigate whether the high orography of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) has helped delay warming over the continent. To that end, we contrast the Antarctic climate response to CO2-doubling with present-day orography to the response with a flattened AIS. To corroborate our findings, we perform this exercise with two different climate models. We find that, with a flattened AIS, CO2-doubling induces more latent heat transport toward the Antarctic continent, greater moisture convergence over the continent and, as a result, more surface-amplified condensational heating. Greater moisture convergence over the continent is made possible by flattening of moist isentropic surfaces, which decreases humidity gradients along the trajectories on which extratropical poleward moisture transport predominantly occurs, thereby enabling more moisture to reach the pole. Furthermore, the polar meridional cell disappears when the AIS is flattened, permitting greater CO2-forced warm temperature advection toward the Antarctic continent. Our results suggest that the high elevation of the present AIS plays a significant role in decreasing the susceptibility of the Antarctic continent to CO2-forced warming.},

Although remote moisture sources contribute substantially more to polar precipitation year-round in the mean state, an increase in locally sourced moisture is crucial to the winter season polar precipitation response to greenhouse gas forcing. In general, the polar hydroclimate response to CO\textsubscript{2}-induced warming is strongly seasonal: over both the Arctic and Antarctic, locally sourced moisture constitutes a larger fraction of the precipitation in winter, while remote sources become even more dominant in summer. Increased local evaporation in fall and winter is coincident with sea ice retreat, which greatly augments local moisture sources in these seasons. In summer, however, larger contributions from more remote moisture source regions are consistent with an increase in moisture residence times and a longer moisture transport length scale, which produces a robust hydrologic cycle response to CO\textsubscript{2}-induced warming globally. The critical role of locally sourced moisture in the hydrologic cycle response of both the Arctic and Antarctic is distinct from controlling factors elsewhere on the globe; for this reason, great care should be taken in interpreting polar isotopic proxy records from climate states unlike the present.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {A simple steady-state model for the thermodynamic structure of a convecting atmosphere under the influence of large-scale dynamics is derived based on a bulk-plume representation of convection. Given profiles of the large-scale vertical velocity and convective mass flux, the model predicts the steady-state temperature and environmental relative humidity profiles as a function of the convective entrainment rate and a parameter representing the importance of condensate reevaporation. The bulk-plume model determines the environmental relative humidity through a balance between the moistening effect of convective detrainment and the drying effect of subsidence in the cloud environment. As the convective mass flux is increased, the importance of detrainment moistening increases, leading to a higher environmental relative humidity. Since the precipitation rate also increases with the convective mass flux, this leads to a steady state in which the precipitation is a strongly increasing function of environmental relative humidity. The bulk-plume model also predicts that the atmospheric stability increases with large-scale upward motion, with the tropospheric lapse rate being most unstable under large-scale descent, when the environmental relative humidity is low. The above relationships are reproduced in a set of simulations with a cloud-system resolving model (CRM) run to equilibrium with imposed large-scale vertical velocity profiles. The results provide insight to the steady-state limit of the well-known problem of determining the relationships between large-scale conditions and the convective state of the atmosphere.},

The importance of the upward shift is well known, but its physical basis and the extent to which it occurs coherently across variables are not well understood. A transformation is derived here that shows how an upward shift of a solution to the moist primitive equations gives a new approximate solution with higher tropospheric temperatures. According to the transformation, all variables shift upward with warming but with an additional modification to the temperature and a general weakening of the pressure velocity. The applicability of the vertical-shift transformation is explored using a hierarchy of models from adiabatic parcel ascents to comprehensive GCMs. The transformation is found to capture many features of the response to climate change in simulations with an idealized GCM, including the mid- and upper-tropospheric changes in lapse rate, relative humidity, and meridional wind. The transformation is less accurate when applied to simulations with more realistic GCMs, but it nonetheless captures some important features. Deviations from the simulated response are primarily due to the surface boundary conditions, which do not necessarily conform to the transformation, especially in the case of the zonal winds. The results allow for a physical interpretation of the upward shift in terms of the governing equations and suggest that it may be thought of as a coherent response of the general circulation of the mid- and upper troposphere.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The twenty-first-century simulation incorporates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 scenario for CO\textsubscript{2} and sulfate emissions. Modeled and observed [from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40)] sea level pressure (SLP) fields are classified using a neural network technique called self-organizing maps to distill a set of characteristic atmospheric circulation patterns over the region north of 60\textdegree N. Model performance is validated for the twentieth century by comparing the frequencies of occurrence of particular circulation regimes in the model to those from the ERA-40. The model successfully captures dominant SLP patterns, but differs from observations in the frequency with which certain patterns occur. The model's twentieth-century vertical mean moisture transport profile across 70\textdegree N compares well in terms of structure but exceeds the observations by about 12\% overall. By relating moisture transport to a particular circulation regime, future changes in moisture transport across 70\textdegree N are assessed and attributed to changes in frequency with which the atmosphere resides in particular SLP patterns and/or to other factors, such as changes in the meridional moisture gradient. By the late twenty-first century, the transport is projected to increase by about 21\% in this model realization, with the largest contribution (32\%) to the total change occurring in summer. Only about one-quarter of the annual increase is due to changes in pattern occupancy, suggesting that the majority is related to mainly thermodynamic factors. A larger poleward moisture transport likely constitutes a positive feedback on the system through related increases in latent heat release and the emission of longwave radiation to the surface.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Results from 360-day integrations with perpetual January conditions are used to describe the model's tropical time-mean climate and its variability. Both convection schemes give reasonable simulations of the time-mean climate, but the representation of the main modes of tropical variability is markedly different.

In contrast, the convective-adjustment scheme has much more transient activity at ail time-scales. The various aspects of the two schemes which might explain this difference are discussed.

  abstract = {A major challenge in paleoclimate modeling studies is reproducing the ``equable'' climate conditions recorded by proxy climate data. This challenge has long been a focus in studies of Eocene paleoclimate. Climate models consistently overestimate mean annual temperature range (MATR) relative to proxy data interpretations and produce minimum temperatures that are far lower than proxy estimates. We hypothesize that the lack of accurate sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a complete annual cycle definition is responsible for some of these model-data discrepancies in Eocene comparisons. To test this hypothesis, we developed two Eocene annual cycle SST data sets as boundary conditions for model experiments and ran full annual cycle and abbreviated cycle (perpetual) cases. When a perpetual case is replaced by a full annual cycle of SST values, the January 0\textdegree C isotherm (freezeline) over North America shifts poleward by {$\sim$}5\textdegree{} latitude and (MATR is reduced by {$\sim$}5\textdegree C. A change from one annual SST cycle to another, equally plausible, annual SST cycle results in a further latitudinal migration ({$\sim$}5\textdegree ) of the freezeline and another {$\sim$}5\textdegree C change in continental interior MATR. Overall, the global mean annual and cold month mean temperatures show little sensitivity to the forcing, while MATR shows larger sensitivity in some continental regions. Our results suggest that the annual cycle of SSTs and the actual SST values incorporated into experiments are major sources of the model-data continental temperature discrepancies reported in past paleoclimate modeling studies. We also find that the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the topography incorporated into paleoclimate models is an additional source of the discrepancy.},

These (type II) polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) form only in regions of very low temperature and as a result the clouds only exist in winter stratospheric polar regions. The formation of Type II PSCs may be linked to tropospheric methane concentrations because oxidation of tropospheric methane is a significant source of stratospheric water vapor. It has been proposed that substantial tropospheric methane existed during the early Eocene, derived from extensive wetland regions and enhanced by global warmth. Increased tropospheric methane concentrations may have led to greater amounts of stratospheric water vapor, creating greater areal extents of PSCs, and/or higher emissitivity values of the clouds. To explore this idea, we have included an extreme case of noninteractive PSCs in a climate modeling sensitivity study of the early Eocene. Results show that the clouds can cause up to 20\textdegree C of surface warming in winter high latitudes. The warming is caused by direct radiative responses to the clouds and by indirect seaice/albedo feedback mechanisms. The temperature response is concentrated at high latitudes, and tropical temperatures are not significantly affected. The temperature pattern produced by the PSCs corresponds more closely to proxy records of high latitude Eocene temperatures than results from other modeling studies to date. Wind patterns, wind-driven oceanic upwelling, and inferred surface salinity also show a response to the PSC forcing. PSCs may have been a significant climate forcing factor for past time intervals associated with high concentrations of atmospheric methane.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ``primitive equations of motion'' are adopted for this study. The nine levels of the model are distributed so as to resolve surface boundary layer fluxes as well as radiative transfer by ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor. The lower boundary is a kinematically uniform land surface without any heat capacity. The stabilizing effect of moist convection is implicitly incorporated into the model by requiring an adjustment of the lapse rate whenever it exceeds the moist adiabatic value. The numerical integrations are performed for the mean annual conditions over a hemisphere starting with an isothermal atmosphere at rest. The spatial distribution of gaseous absorbers is assumed to have the annual mean value of the actual atmosphere and to be constant with time. A quasi-equilibrium is attained about which a cyclic energy variation occurs with an irregular period of about 2 weeks. The dominant wave number of the meridional component of the wind is 5 to 6 in the troposphere but is reduced to about 3 in the stratosphere. The gross structure and behavior of the tropopause and stratosphere below 30 km. agree reasonably well with observation. The meridional circulation obtained from the computation has a 3-cell structure in the troposphere and tends toward a 2-cell structure with increasing altitude in the stratosphere. Although the level of the jet stream as well as that of the maximum northward transport of momentum coincides with observation, the intensity of the jet stream turns out to be much stronger than the observed annual mean. In the stratosphere the temperature increases with increasing latitude because of the effect of large-scale motion. The magnitude of the increase, however, is smaller than that observed. A detailed study of the vertical distribution of the budget of kinetic energy, of available potential energy, of heat, and of angular momentum is made. The mechanism for maintaining the kinetic energy of the jet stream and of the stratosphere is discussed. It is concluded that in the model the kinetic energy in the stratosphere is maintained against its conversion into potential energy and dissipation through interaction with the troposphere, which is in qualitative agreement with the results derived from an analysis of the actual atmosphere. In the troposphere, the conversion of potential energy reaches a maximum at about the 500-mb. level. This energy is then transferred to the level of the jet stream and to the surface boundary layer by the so-called pressure interaction term, thus providing the source of kinetic energy for these two levels at which dissipation is predominant. As with the results of Phillips [27] and Smagorinsky [37], the ratio of eddy kinetic energy to zonal kinetic energy and that of eddy to zonal available potential energy are computed to be much smaller than those of the actual atmosphere.},

(2) How does the global climate system respond to changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice? These issues will be addressed with multi-model simulations that are forced with different combinations of sea ice and/or sea surface temperatures representing present-day, pre-industrial and future conditions. The use of three time periods allows the signals of interest to be diagnosed in multiple ways.

  abstract = {The possibility that Arctic sea ice loss weakens mid-latitude westerlies, promoting more severe cold winters, has sparked more than a decade of scientific debate, with apparent support from observations but inconclusive modelling evidence. Here we show that sixteen models contributing to the Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project simulate a weakening of mid-latitude westerlies in response to projected Arctic sea ice loss. We develop an emergent constraint based on eddy feedback, which is 1.2 to 3 times too weak in the models, suggesting that the real-world weakening lies towards the higher end of the model simulations. Still, the modelled response to Arctic sea ice loss is weak: the North Atlantic Oscillation response is similar in magnitude and offsets the projected response to increased greenhouse gases, but would only account for around 10\% of variations in individual years. We further find that relationships between Arctic sea ice and atmospheric circulation have weakened recently in observations and are no longer inconsistent with those in models.},

  abstract = {On 27 August 2013, during the Studies of Emissions and Atmospheric Composition, Clouds and Climate Coupling by Regional Surveys field mission, NASA's ER-2 research aircraft encountered a region of enhanced water vapor, extending over a depth of approximately 2 km and a minimum areal extent of 20,000 km2 in the stratosphere (375 K to 415 K potential temperature), south of the Great Lakes (42\textdegree N, 90\textdegree W). Water vapor mixing ratios in this plume, measured by the Harvard Water Vapor instrument, constitute the highest values recorded in situ at these potential temperatures and latitudes. An analysis of geostationary satellite imagery in combination with trajectory calculations links this water vapor enhancement to its source, a deep tropopause-penetrating convective storm system that developed over Minnesota 20 h prior to the aircraft plume encounter. High resolution, ground-based radar data reveal that this system was composed of multiple individual storms, each with convective turrets that extended to a maximum of 4 km above the tropopause level for several hours. In situ water vapor data show that this storm system irreversibly delivered between 6.6 kt and 13.5 kt of water to the stratosphere. This constitutes a 20\textendash 25\% increase in water vapor abundance in a column extending from 115 hP to 70 hPa over the plume area. Both in situ and satellite climatologies show a high frequency of localized water vapor enhancements over the central U.S. in summer, suggesting that deep convection can contribute to the stratospheric water budget over this region and season.},

The significant hail ({$\geq$}2-in. diameter), significant wind ({$\geq$}65-kt thunderstorm gusts), and tornadoes were filtered by the maximum event magnitude per hour on a 40-km Rapid Update Cycle model horizontal grid. The filtering process produced 22 901 tornado and significant severe thunderstorm events, representing 78.5\% of all such reports in the CONUS during the sample period. The convective mode scheme presented herein begins with three radar-based storm categories: 1) discrete cells, 2) clusters of cells, and 3) quasi-linear convective systems (QLCSs). Volumetric radar data were examined for right-moving supercell (RM) and left-moving supercell characteristics within the three radar reflectivity designations. Additional categories included storms with marginal supercell characteristics and linear hybrids with a mix of supercell and QLCS structures. Smoothed kernel density estimates of events per decade revealed clear geographic and seasonal patterns of convective modes with tornadoes. Discrete and cluster RMs are the favored convective mode with southern Great Plains tornadoes during the spring, while the Deep South displayed the greatest variability in tornadic convective modes in the fall, winter, and spring. The Ohio Valley favored a higher frequency of QLCS tornadoes and a lower frequency of RM compared to the Deep South and the Great Plains. Tornadoes with nonsupercellular/non-QLCS storms were more common across Florida and the high plains in the summer. Significant hail events were dominated by Great Plains supercells, while variations in convective modes were largest for significant wind events.},

  abstract = {Abstract As in the midlatitude atmosphere, midocean eddies are primarily generated by baroclinically unstable mean currents. In contrast to the atmosphere, however, oceanic currents are significantly nonzonal. Even weak nonzonal currents are linearly unstable since {$\beta$} does not suppress growing meridional waves. Theories for the nonlinear equilibration of baroclinic instability, and hence theories for the amplitudes of midocean eddies, must therefore take into account the different dynamics of nonzonal flow. It is shown here that the amplitude of fully developed baroclinic turbulence due to nonzonal shears differs from that due to zonal shears primarily in the nature of the eddy generation. Since {$\beta$} will act to create large-scale zonal jet structures regardless of the generation source, the nature of eddy fluxes of potential vorticity (the source of eddy energy) in the zonal and meridional directions are fundamentally different. The cross-jet mixing has been shown previously to obey a mixing-length scaling, and this corresponds to the generation due to unstable zonal flow. The along-jet mixing, which corresponds to the generation due to the meridional shear, is shown here to be best described by a shear dispersion model. The resulting flux is orders of magnitude higher than in the cross-jet direction, and thus eddy energies driven by baroclinically unstable mean flows with a nonzero meridional component are much larger. This provides an explanation for recently reported results. Moreover, given recent observational and modeling studies showing the ubiquitous presence of zonal jets in the oceans, the results presented here indicate a powerful source of eddy energy.},

  abstract = {We review the widely used concepts of ``buoyancy'' and ``Convective Available Potential Energy'' (CAPE) in relation to deep convection in tropical cyclones and discuss their limitations. A fact easily forgotten in applying these concepts is that the buoyancy force of an air parcel as often defined is non-unique because it depends on the arbitrary definition of a reference density field. However, when calculating CAPE, the buoyancy of a lifted air parcel is related to the specific reference density field along a vertical column passing through that parcel. Both concepts can be generalized for a vortical flow and to slantwise ascent of a lifted parcel in such a flow. In all cases, the air parcel is assumed to have infinitely small dimensions. In this paper, we explore the consequences of generalizing buoyancy and CAPE for buoyant regions of finite size, which perturb the pressure field in their immediate environment. Quantitative calculations of effective buoyancy, defined as the sum of the conventional buoyancy and the static vertical perturbation pressure gradient force induced by it, are shown for buoyant regions of finite width. For a judicious choice of reference density, the effective buoyancy per unit mass is essentially a unique force, independent of the reference density, but its distribution depends on the horizontal scale of the buoyant region. A corresponding concept of effective CAPE is introduced and its relevance to deep convection in tropical cyclones is discussed. The study is conceived as a first step in understanding the decreasing ability of inner-core deep convection in tropical cyclones to ventilate the mass of air converging in the frictional boundary layer as the vortex matures and decays.},

  abstract = {Abstract Satellite altimetric observations of the ocean reveal surface pressure patterns in the core of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) that propagate downstream (eastward) but slower than the mean surface current by about 25\%. The authors argue that these observations are suggestive of baroclinically unstable waves that have a steering level at a depth of about 1 km. Detailed linear stability calculations using a hydrographic atlas indeed reveal a steering level in the ACC near the depth implied by the altimetric observations. Calculations using a nonlinear model forced by the mean shear and stratification observed close to the core of the ACC, coinciding with a position where mooring data and direct eddy flux measurements are available, reveal a similar picture, albeit with added details. When eddy fluxes are allowed to adjust the mean state, computed eddy kinetic energy and eddy stress are close to observed magnitudes with steering levels between 1 and 1.5 km, broadly consistent with observations. An important result of this study is that the vertical structure of the potential vorticity (PV) eddy diffusivity is strongly depth dependent, implying that the diffusivity for PV and buoyancy are very different from one another. It is shown that the flow can simultaneously support a PV diffusivity peaking at 5000 m2 s-1 or so near the middepth steering level and a buoyancy diffusivity that is much smaller, of order 1000 m2 s-1, exhibiting less vertical structure. An effective diffusivity calculation, using an advected and diffused tracer transformed into area coordinates, confirms that the PV diffusivity more closely reflects the mixing properties of the flow than does the buoyancy diffusivity, and points explicitly to the need for separating tracer and buoyancy flux parameterizations in coarse-resolution general circulation models. Finally, implications for the eddy-driven circulation of the ACC are discussed.},

The models are the ``L1'' dynamics, the ``geostrophic potential vorticity'' equations, and the more familiar quasigeostrophic and planetary geostrophic equations. Multilayer shallow water equations are used as a control. The goal is to determine whether these models accurately portray linear baroclinic instability properties in various geophysically relevant parameter regimes, in a highly idealized and limited set of cases. The L1 and geostrophic potential vorticity models are properly balanced (devoid of inertio-gravity waves, except possibly at solid boundaries), valid on the {$\beta$} plane, and contain both quasigeostrophy and planetary geostrophy as limits in different parameter regimes; hence, they are appropriate models for phenomena that span the deformation and planetary scales of motion. The L1 model also includes the ``frontal geostrophic'' equations as a third limit. In fact, the choice to investigate such relatively unfamiliar models is motivated precisely by their applicability to multiple scales of motion. The models are cast in multilayer form, and the dispersion properties and eigenfunctions of wave modes and baroclinic instabilities produced are found numerically. It is found that both the L1 and geostrophic potential vorticity models have sensible linear stability properties with no artifactual instabilities or divergences. Their growth rates are very close to those of the shallow water equations in both quasigeostrophic and planetary geostrophic parameter regimes. The growth rate of baroclinic instability in the planetary geostrophic equations is shown to be generally less than the growth rate of the other models near the deformation radius. The growth rate of the planetary geostrophic equations diverges at high wavenumbers, but it is shown how this is ameliorated by the presence of the relative vorticity term in the geostrophic potential vorticity equations.},

  abstract = {Abstract An equivalent-barotropic fluid on the {$\beta$} plane, forced at small scales by random stirring and dissipated by linear heat and vorticity drag, is considered as a local model for flow in the weather layer of internally forced planetary atmospheres. The combined presence of {$\beta$}, a finite deformation scale, and large-scale dissipation produce novel dynamics with possible relevance to the giant gas planets, which are apparently driven by small-scale convective stirring. It is shown that in order for anisotropy to form, one must have {$\beta$}({$\epsilon\lambda$}5)-1/3 {$\greaterequivlnt$} 3.9, where {$\epsilon$} is the (convectively driven) energy generation rate, {$\lambda$} is the deformation wavenumber, and {$\beta$} is the Coriolis gradient. The critical value above is not equivalent to the barotropic stability criterion, and numerical simulations demonstrate that anisotropic flow with average zonal velocities that are supercritical with respect to the latter can form. The formation of jets (a different matter) is not implied by the excess of zonal kinetic energy, and is instead sensitive to the relevant stability criterion for the flow geometry at hand. When {$\beta$} is sufficiently large that anisotropy does form, the flow scale and rms zonal velocity are set by a combination of Rossby wave cascade inhibition, the total energy constraint imposed by the large-scale dissipation, and the partitioning between available potential and kinetic energies. The resulting theory demonstrates that a relatively narrow range of parameters will allow for the formation of anisotropic flow with scale larger than the deformation scale. This is consistent with observations that indicate little separation between the jet scales and deformation scales on Jupiter and Saturn.},

It is proposed here that these thermohaline filaments result from the mesoscale stirring of large-scale temperature and salinity gradients by geostrophic turbulence, resulting in a direct cascade of thermohaline variance to small scales. This hypothesis is investigated as follows: Measurements from NATRE are used to generate mean temperature, salinity, and shear profiles. The mean stratification and shear are used as the background state in a high-resolution horizontally homogeneous quasigeostrophic model. The mean state is baroclinically unstable, and the model produces a vigorous eddy field. Temperature and salinity are stirred laterally in each density layer by the geostrophic velocity and vertical advection is by the ageostrophic velocity. The simulated temperature\textendash salinity diagram exhibits fluctuations at depths just below the thermocline of similar magnitude to those found in the NATRE data. It is shown that vertical diffusion is sufficient to absorb the laterally driven cascade of tracer variance through an amplification of filamentary slopes by small-scale shear. These results suggest that there is a strong coupling between vertical mixing and horizontal stirring in the ocean at scales below the deformation radius.},

  abstract = {Abstract Quasigeostrophic turbulence theory and numerical simulation are used to study the mechanisms determining the scale, structure, and equilibration of mesoscale ocean eddies. The present work concentrates on using freely decaying geostrophic turbulence to understand and explain the vertical and horizontal flow of energy through a stratified, horizontally homogeneous geostrophic fluid. It is found that the stratification profile, in particular the presence of a pycnocline, has significant, qualitative effects on the efficiency and spectral pathways of energy flow. Specifically, with uniform stratification, energy in high baroclinic modes transfers directly, quickly (within a few eddy turnaround times), and almost completely to the barotropic mode. By contrast, in the presence of oceanlike stratification, kinetic energy in high baroclinic modes transfers intermediately to the first baroclinic mode, whence it transfers inefficiently (and incompletely) to the barotropic mode. The efficiency of transfer to the barotropic mode is reduced as the pycnocline is made increasingly thin. The {$\beta$} effect, on the other hand, improves the efficiency of barotropization, but for oceanically realistic parameters this effect is relatively unimportant compared to the effects of nonuniform stratification. Finally, the nature of turbulent cascade dynamics is such as to lead to a concentration of first baroclinic mode kinetic energy near the first radius of deformation, which, in the case of a nonuniform and oceanically realistic stratification, has a significant projection at the surface. This may in part explain recent observations of surface eddy scales by TOPEX/Poseidon satellite altimetry, which indicate a correlation of surface-height variance with the scale of the first deformation radius.},

  abstract = {Abstract The statistical dynamics of midocean eddies, generated by baroclinic instability of a zonal mean flow, are studied in the context of homogeneous stratified quasigeostrophic turbulence. Existing theory for eddy scales and energies in fully developed turbulence is generalized and applied to a system with surface-intensified stratification and arbitrary zonal shear. The theory gives a scaling for the magnitude of the eddy potential vorticity flux, and its (momentum conserving) vertical structure. The theory is tested numerically by varying the magnitude and mode of the mean shear, the Coriolis gradient, and scale thickness of the stratification and found to be partially successful. It is found that the dynamics of energy in high (m {$>$} 1) baroclinic modes typically resembles the turbulent diffusion of a passive scalar, regardless of the stratification profile, although energy in the first mode does not. It is also found that surface-intensified stratification affects the baroclinicity of flow: as thermocline thickness is decreased, the (statistically equilibrated) baroclinic energy levels remain nearly constant but the statistically equilibrated level of barotropic eddy energy falls. Eddy statistics are found to be relatively insensitive to the magnitude of linear bottom drag in the small drag limit. The theory for the magnitude and structure of the eddy potential vorticity flux is tested against a 15-layer simulation using profiles of density and shear representative of those found in the mid North Atlantic; the theory shows good skill in representing the vertical structure of the flux, and so might serve as the basis for a parameterization of eddy fluxes in the midocean. Finally, baroclinic kinetic energy is found to concentrate near the deformation scale. To the degree that surface motions represent baroclinic eddy kinetic energy, the present results are consistent with the observed correlation between surface eddy scales and the first radius of deformation.},

  abstract = {The recent annually averaged warming of the Antarctic Peninsula, and of West Antarctica, stands in stark contrast to very small trends over East Antarctica. This asymmetry arises primarily from a highly significant warming of West Antarctica in austral spring and a cooling of East Antarctica in austral autumn. Here we examine whether this East\textendash West asymmetry is a response to anthropogenic climate forcings or a manifestation of natural climate variability. We compare the observed Antarctic surface air temperature trends over two distinct time periods (1960\textendash 2005 and 1979\textendash 2005), and with those simulated by 40 models participating in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project~(CMIP5). We find that the observed East\textendash West asymmetry differs substantially between the two periods and, furthermore, that it is completely absent from the forced response seen in the CMIP5 multi-model mean, from which all natural variability is eliminated by the averaging. We also examine the relationship between the Southern Annular mode (SAM) and Antarctic temperature trends, in both models and reanalyses, and again conclude that there is little evidence of anthropogenic SAM-induced driving of the recent temperature trends. These results offer new, compelling evidence pointing to natural climate variability as a key contributor to the recent warming of West Antarctica and of the Peninsula.},

  abstract = {Abstract Recent studies indicate that altimetric observations of the ocean's mesoscale eddy field reflect the combined influence of surface buoyancy and interior potential vorticity anomalies. The former have a surface-trapped structure, while the latter are often well represented by the barotropic and first baroclinic modes. To assess the relative importance of each contribution to the signal, it is useful to project the observed field onto a set of modes that separates their influence in a natural way. However, the surface-trapped dynamics are not well represented by standard baroclinic modes; moreover, they are dependent on horizontal scale. Here the authors derive a modal decomposition that results from the simultaneous diagonalization of the energy and a generalization of potential enstrophy that includes contributions from the surface buoyancy fields. This approach yields a family of orthonormal bases that depend on two parameters; the standard baroclinic modes are recovered in a limiting case, while other choices provide modes that represent surface and interior dynamics in an efficient way. For constant stratification, these modes consist of symmetric and antisymmetric exponential modes that capture the surface dynamics and a series of oscillating modes that represent the interior dynamics. Motivated by the ocean, where shears are concentrated near the upper surface, the authors consider the special case of a quiescent lower surface. In this case, the interior modes are independent of wavenumber, and there is a single exponential surface mode that replaces the barotropic mode. The use and effectiveness of these modes is demonstrated by projecting the energy in a set of simulations of baroclinic turbulence.},

  abstract = {Motivated in part by the problem of large-scale lateral turbulent heat transport in the  Earth's atmosphere and oceans, and in part by the problem of turbulent transport  itself, we seek to better understand the transport of a passive tracer advected by  various types of fully developed two-dimensional turbulence. The types of turbulence  considered correspond to various relationships between the streamfunction and the  advected field. Each type of turbulence considered possesses two quadratic invariants  and each can develop an inverse cascade. These cascades can be modified or halted, for  example, by friction, a background vorticity gradient or a mean temperature gradient.  We focus on three physically realizable cases: classical two-dimensional turbulence,  surface quasi-geostrophic turbulence, and shallow-water quasi-geostrophic turbulence  at scales large compared to the radius of deformation. In each model we assume that  tracer variance is maintained by a large-scale mean tracer gradient while turbulent  energy is produced at small scales via random forcing, and dissipated by linear  drag. We predict the spectral shapes, eddy scales and equilibrated energies resulting  from the inverse cascades, and use the expected velocity and length scales to predict  integrated tracer fluxes.When linear drag halts the cascade, the resulting diffusivities are decreasing functions of the drag coefficient, but with different dependences for each case. When {$\beta$} is  significant, we find a clear distinction between the tracer mixing scale, which depends  on {$\beta$} but is nearly independent of drag, and the energy-containing (or jet) scale, set  by a combination of the drag coefficient and {$\beta$}. Our predictions are tested via high- resolution spectral simulations. We find in all cases that the passive scalar is diffused  down-gradient with a diffusion coefficient that is well-predicted from estimates of  mixing length and velocity scale obtained from turbulence phenomenology.},

  abstract = {Recently, a new consistent way of parametrizing simultaneously local and non-local turbulent transport for the convective atmospheric boundary layer has been proposed and tested for the clear boundary layer. This approach assumes that in the convective boundary layer the subgrid-scale fluxes result from two different mixing scales: small eddies, that are parametrized by an eddy-diffusivity approach, and thermals, which are represented by a mass-flux contribution. Since the interaction between the cloud layer and the underlying sub-cloud layer predominantly takes place through strong updraughts, this approach offers an interesting avenue of establishing a unified description of the turbulent transport in the cumulus-topped boundary layer. This paper explores the possibility of such a new approach for the cumulus-topped boundary layer. In the sub-cloud and cloud layers, the mass-flux term represents the effect of strong updraughts. These are modelled by a simple entraining parcel, which determines the mean properties of the strong updraughts, the boundary-layer height, the lifting condensation level and cloud top. The residual smaller-scale turbulent transport is parametrized with an eddy-diffusivity approach that uses a turbulent kinetic energy closure. The new scheme is implemented and tested in the research model MesoNH. Copyright \textcopyright{} 2004 Royal Meteorological Society},

  abstract = {Theories for the position and intensity of precipitation over tropical oceans on climate time scales have a perplexing disagreement between those that focus on the momentum budget of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and those that focus on thermodynamic factors. In the case of narrow intertropical convergence zones (ITCZs), there is some evidence for both classes of theories, and there are large open questions on the interpretation of the moist static energy (MSE) and momentum budgets of these regions. We develop a model in which both types of mechanisms can operate and the interaction between them can be analyzed. The model includes a mixed-layer ABL, coupled to a free troposphere whose vertical structure follows the quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation model (QTCM) of Neelin and Zeng. The case analyzed here is axisymmetric, using a fixed sea surface temperature (SST) lower boundary condition with an idealized off-equatorial SST maximum. We examine a regime with small values of the gross moist stability associated with tropospheric motions, which is realistic but poses theoretical challenges. In both rotating (equatorial {$\beta$}-plane) and nonrotating cases, the model ITCZ width and intensity are substantially controlled by the horizontal diffusion of moisture, which is hypothesized to be standing in for nonaxisymmetric transients. The inclusion of the ABL increases the amplitude and sharpness of the ITCZ, contributing to the importance of diffusion. Analytical solutions under simplifying assumptions show that the ABL contribution is not singular in the nondiffusive limit; it just features an ITCZ more intense than observed. A negative gross moist stability contribution associated with the flow component driven by ABL momentum dynamics plays a large role in this. Because of the ABL contribution, the flow imports, rather than exports, MSE in the ITCZ, but we show that this can be understood rather simply. The ABL contribution can be approximately viewed as a forcing to the tropospheric thermodynamics. The ABL forcing term is in addition to thermodynamic forcing by net flux terms in the MSE budget, which otherwise is much as in the standard QTCM. The ABL momentum budget suggests that divergent flow in the ABL is controlled to a significant extent by the pressure gradient imprinted on the ABL by the SST gradient\textemdash termed the Lindzen\textendash Nigam contribution\textemdash although we also find that the thermodynamics mediating this is nontrivial, especially in the rotating case. Nonetheless, when this component of the pressure gradient is artificially removed, the peak ITCZ precipitation is reduced by a fraction on the order of 15 to 25\%, less than might have been expected based on the diagnosis of the ABL momentum budget.},

The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor are tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, demonstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.},

Previous studies have focused on the changes of subtropical highs during their peak season (June\textendash August)6\textendash 8, but little is known about their changes in other seasons. Here, a suite of multi-model simulations are used to demonstrate the robust seasonally dependent responses of subtropical highs and tropical rainfall to anthropogenic warming. The zonal-mean subtropical highs in the Northern Hemisphere are shown to strengthen more during April\textendash June than July\textendash September, with opposite responses for the Southern Hemisphere counterparts. These responses are closely related to a southward shift of tropical rainfall in April\textendash June relative to July\textendash September, manifesting in a seasonal delay of tropical rainfall and monsoon onset in the Northern Hemisphere9,10. Such seasonality is found to occur in response to elevated latent energy demand in the hemisphere warming up seasonally, as dictated by the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relation. The interhemispheric energy contrast drives a southward shift of tropical rainfall that strengthens the Hadley cell and zonal-mean subtropical highs in the Northern Hemisphere in April\textendash June relative to July\textendash September. These changes scale linearly with warming, with increasing implications for projecting climate changes in the tropics and subtropics as warming continues.},

Measurements were taken over both ice-free and ice-covered surfaces near the ice edge, offering insight into the role of the surface state in shaping the atmospheric conditions. The initiation of the autumn freeze-up was related to a change in air mass, rather than to changes in solar radiation alone; the lower atmosphere cooled abruptly, leading to a surface heat loss. During melt season, strong surface inversions persisted over the ice, while elevated inversions were more frequent over open water. These differences disappeared during autumn freeze-up, when elevated inversions persisted over both ice-free and ice-covered conditions. These results are in contrast to previous studies that found a well-mixed boundary layer persisting in summer and an increased frequency of surface-based inversions in autumn, suggesting that knowledge derived from measurements taken within the pan-Arctic area and on the central ice pack does not necessarily apply closer to the ice edge. This study offers an insight into the atmospheric processes that occur during a crucial period of the year; understanding and accurately modeling these processes is essential for the improvement of ice-extent predictions and future Arctic climate projections.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It is found that the WMI, MGR, and other properties are more closely related to slope of the isentropes, S\texttheta, in the layer than to Richardson number, Ri, or to shear and lapse rate individually. The results for the layer positioned in the lower, middle and upper troposphere are similar but show systematic variations. The largest WMIs (3000\textendash 6000 km) are found for intermediate isentropic slopes of the order of those observed. Much smaller WMIs are found for small and very large isentropic slopes. The MGRs are of the order of 1 d-1 for small and intermediate slopes, but much larger for large slopes (S\texttheta{} {$\greaterequivlnt$}6 \texttimes{} 10-3 or Ri {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.5). The results suggest temporal and upward increases of WMI as shear and static stability develop in association with growth of the baroclinic wave. They also suggest typical WMIs somewhat larger than the 3100 km for the standard atmosphere.},

  abstract = {The distribution of radiative cooling in the vicinity of a temperature inversion in the middle troposphere is calculated for several distributions of humidity. When mixing ratios are high throughout the inversion radiative cooling acts to erode the inversion (minimum cooling at the base, maximum cooling at the top). When mixing ratio decreases rapidly upward from the inversion base most of the inversion is a region of reduced cooling, while maximum cooling amounting to several degrees per day occurs in the vicinity of the inversion base. The region immediately below the inversion base is subject to strong radiative destabilization. Verification of the theoretical cooling rates is sought in ten radiometer-sonde ascents at Tucson, Arizona. The radiometer-sonde is only marginally applicable to determining the radiative cooling distribution in the vicinity of the inversions, and random radiometer-sonde errors and consequences of slant ascent are examined in detail. The radiometer-sonde measurements, when averaged, verify that radiative cooling is so distributed as to tend to maintain the inversion, showing maximum cooling of the order of 2\textdegree C day-1 at and below the base and minimum cooling of the order of 1\textdegree C day-1 in the upper part of the inversion. No verification was found for the theoretical destabilization of the layer below the inversion base, although errors and scatter of measurements obscure the true distribution. All ten radiometer-sonde ascents also penetrated the tropopause, and warming or minimum cooling was found at or very near the tropopause in every ascent. Hence the tropopause must be maintained by processes other than radiation.},

Here, we leverage an ensemble of models of many types in an idealized configuration to investigate how and why high clouds change the way they do. We find that deep-convecting anvils, independent of how cloud fraction is defined, increase in height, increase slightly in temperature, and (generally) decrease in cloud fraction with warming sea surface temperature (SST). The controls on anvil height and temperature have well established physical reasoning, but the response of anvil cloud fraction to warming is more variable across studies and not as well understood. We test a previously published hypothesis for control of anvil coverage and find that, at least to first order, it is highly controlled by radiatively-driven divergence, in which, with warming, anvil clouds occur in a more stable environment requiring less divergence to balance radiative cooling and, therefore, decreasing cloud coverage. We also find mid-level clouds robustly decrease in coverage with warming SST and can be represented by a diagnostic scaling which attributes the robust decrease in mid-level clouds to the rapid increase in the overall convective heating of the clouds compared to the much slower increase in the integrated radiative cooling rate. The robust response of deep-convective clouds to warming and support for the underlying physical mechanisms across the spectrum of models, with both explicit and parameterized convection, increases confidence in their contribution to climate feedbacks.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric blocking represents an important aspect of the mid-latitude weather variability, but the different processes contributing to its formation and maintenance are not yet fully understood. This study investigates the role that diabatic processes, in particular the release of latent heating in strongly ascending airstreams, play in the dynamics and spatio-temporal variability of blocking in a detailed 38-year global climatological analysis. The results show that the formation and (re-)intensification of blocking are often preceded by latent heating connected to upstream baroclinic developments. While the importance of latent heating varies considerably between individual blocking events and different regions, in particular between ocean and continents, latent heating is generally most important during onset and in more intense and larger blocks. The episodic nature of latent heating during the blocking life cycle, associated with a series of transient cyclones approaching the blocking, can contribute to both the high- (fast onset and fluctuation in intensity and size) and low-frequency (maintenance and quasi-stationarity during maturation phase) properties of blocking anticyclones and provide the required flow amplification in addition to dry-dynamical interaction between synoptic eddies and blocking. This amplification results from a combination of the direct injection of anticyclonic air into the upper-troposphere within cross-isentropic ascending airstreams, setting up large-scale anticyclonic PV anomalies, and the advection of PV by the enhanced divergent outflow at the tropopause (indirect effect). This divergent outflow on the western flank of the blocking anticyclone interacts with the upper-level PV gradient and leads to a westward amplification of the ridge, diminishing the tendency for dissipation and the eastward advection by the background flow, thus contributing to blocking stationarity. Taking into account such diabatic mechanisms in blocking dynamics will be important to improve predictions of blocking and assess future changes in the extratropical large-scale circulation.},

  abstract = {Strong rivers of westerly winds, known as jet streams, are driven primarily by temperature differences between low and high latitudes as well as the rotation of the Earth. The jet streams create and impact weather systems and steer them in the midlatitudes of both hemispheres. Often, these jet streams do not flow directly from west to east, but rather meander north and south in a wave pattern of alternating high- and low-pressure regions. These meanders are Rossby waves, which influence the jet streams via baroclinic instability caused by temperature gradients. Depending on their wavelength, latitude, and the background wind speed, these waves can move to the east or to the west and under certain conditions also be (quasi)stationary. Jet streams can locally increase the gradient of vorticity (atmospheric spin), so that atmospheric wave guides may be formed. These waveguides affect the propagation pathways of Rossby waves, often leading to more zonal propagation, and potentially amplification of waves. Rossby waves, jets, and waveguides affect atmospheric eddies, such as anticyclonic blocks, and can create prolonged weather conditions that lead to extreme weather impacts. Anthropogenic climate change is weakening the north\textendash south temperature gradient. The rapid warming of the Arctic, known as Arctic amplification, is one factor affecting the poleward temperature gradient. It has been hypothesized that a weakened jet stream tends to be ``wavier,'' which may increase the probability of atmospheric blocking. On the other hand, anthropogenic climate change also cools the polar lower stratosphere and warms the tropical upper troposphere, which should act to strengthen the jet. Jet streams may therefore be experiencing a ``tug-of-war'' between these effects with opposing signs. Together, these changes tend to increase the vertical wind shear in midlatitudes, leading to increases in turbulence at the cruising altitude of aircraft. It is not yet clear which of these two effects of amplified warming will be dominant, nor how this will depend on season, region, and background state, but changes in the jet would have potential implications for the frequency of extreme weather in a future, warmer climate.},

The change in precipitation, water vapor, clouds, and radiative heating of the atmosphere evident in the 1\% increase in carbon dioxide until doubled (1pctto2x) scenario is examined. As noted in other studies, the ensemble-mean changes in water vapor as carbon dioxide is doubled occur at a rate similar to that predicted by the Clausius\textendash Clapeyron relationship. The ratio of global changes in precipitation to global changes in water vapor offers some insight on how readily increased water vapor is converted into precipitation in modeled climate change. This ratio {$\epsilon$} is introduced in this paper as a gross indicator of the global precipitation efficiency under global warming.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The main findings of this paper are threefold. First, increases in the global precipitation track increase atmospheric radiative energy loss and the ratio of precipitation sensitivity to water vapor sensitivity is primarily determined by changes to this atmospheric column energy loss. A reference limit to this ratio is introduced as the rate at which the emission of radiation from the clear-sky atmosphere increases as water vapor increases. It is shown that the derived efficiency based on the simple ratio of precipitation to water vapor sensitivities of models in fact closely matches the sensitivity derived from simple energy balance arguments involving changes to water vapor emission alone. Second, although the rate of increase of clear-sky emission is the dominant factor in the change to the energy balance of the atmosphere, there are two important and offsetting processes that contribute to {$\epsilon$} in the model simulations studied: One involves a negative feedback through cloud radiative heating that acts to reduce the efficiency; the other is the global reduction in sensible heating that counteracts the effects of the cloud feedback and increases the efficiency. These counteracting feedbacks only apply on the global scale. Third, the negative cloud radiative heating feedback occurs through reductions of cloud amount in the middle troposphere, defined as the layer between 680 and 440 hPa, and by slight global cloud decreases in the lower troposphere. These changes act in a manner to expose the warmer atmosphere below to high clouds, thus resulting in a net warming of the atmospheric column by clouds and a negative feedback on the precipitation.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

This yields a net transport of heat towards the NH composing of a northward cross-equatorial heat transport by the oceans and a southward heat flow in the atmosphere. The turbulent fluxes and hemispheric precipitation balance to about 3~Wm-2 with slightly larger total accumulation occurring in the NH. CloudSat data indicate more frequent precipitation in the SH implying more intense precipitation in the NH. Fully coupled climate model simulations show that reducing hemispheric energy balance biases does little to reduce existing biases in tropical precipitation.},

Using an asymptotic expansion in the parameter h/R{$\mu$}1 we investigate the inertial oscillations of ``large scale'' disturbances at the equator. It is found that the vertical constraints on the motion inhibit the lateral (poleward) propagation of low frequency energy. Solutions of the non-separable eigenvalue problem give standing oscillations whose longest period is (R/h){$\frac{1}{2}$} (2{$\pi$}/{$\Omega$}) and which are self-confined within a distance of order (Rh){$\frac{1}{2}$} on either side of the equator. This axial symmetric calculation is probably valid for disturbances whose east-west wave-length is large compared with the width of the ``boundary layer'' (Rh){$\frac{1}{2}$}. It is suggested that a trapped wave can transfer energy to a mean flow at the equator, as the result of the correlation between the velocity components of the eigenfunction. In the bottom water of the equatorial ocean, where, the stratification is small, there might be oscillations whose period is of the order of a month and which extended some 300 km north and south of the equator. When the static stability is appreciable the effect can only be expected if, on this time scale, the fluid dissipates temperature perturbations much more rapidly than momentum.},

Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model.

MACv2-SP provides a prescription of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated Twomey effect. It was created to provide a harmonized description of post-1850 anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing for climate modeling studies. MACv2-SP has been designed to be easy to implement, change and use, and thereby enable studies exploring the climatic effects of different patterns of aerosol radiative forcing, including a Twomey effect. MACv2-SP is formulated in terms of nine spatial plumes associated with different major anthropogenic source regions. The shape of the plumes is fit to the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, version 2, whose present-day (2005) distribution is anchored by surface-based observations. Two types of plumes are considered: one predominantly associated with biomass burning, the other with industrial emissions. These differ in the prescription of their annual cycle and in their optical properties, thereby implicitly accounting for different contributions of absorbing aerosol to the different plumes. A Twomey effect for each plume is prescribed as a change in the host model's background cloud-droplet population density using relationships derived from satellite data. Year-to-year variations in the amplitude of the plumes over the historical period (1850\textendash 2016) are derived by scaling the plumes with associated national emission sources of SO\textsubscript{2} and NH\textsubscript{3}. Experiments using MACv2-SP are performed with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. The globally and annually averaged instantaneous and effective aerosol radiative forcings are estimated to be -0.6 and -0.5 W m\textsuperscript{-2}, respectively. Forcing from aerosol\textendash cloud interactions (the Twomey effect) offsets the reduction of clear-sky forcing by clouds, so that the net effect of clouds on the aerosol forcing is small; hence, the clear-sky forcing, which is more readily measurable, provides a good estimate of the total aerosol forcing.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In order to obtain objective detection criteria, the efficacy of several parameters for separating polar lows from other cyclones has been compared. The comparison and the climatology are based on the ERA-Interim reanalysis from 1979 to 2016 and the high-resolution Arctic System Reanalysis from 2000 to 2012. The most effective parameters in separating polar lows from other extratropical cyclones were found to be the difference between the sea-level pressure at the centre of the low and its surroundings, the difference in the potential temperature between the sea surface and the 500 hPa level, and the tropopause wind speed poleward of the system. Other parameters often used to identify polar lows, such as the 10 m wind speed and the temperature difference between the sea surface and the 700 hPa level, were found to be less effective. The climatologies reveal that polar lows occur in all marine basins at high latitudes, but with high occurrence density in the vicinity of the sea-ice edge and coastal zones. The regions showing the highest degree of polar-low activity are the Denmark Strait and the Nordic Seas, especially for the most intense polar lows. In the North Atlantic and Pacific, the main polar-low season ranges from November to March. In the Southern Hemisphere, polar lows are mainly detected between 50 and 65\textdegree S from April to October, indicating that this hemisphere compared to its northern counterpart has a two months longer, but less intense, polar-low season. No significant hemispheric long-term trends are observed, although some regions, such as the Denmark Strait and the Nordic Seas, experience significant downward and upward trends in polar lows, respectively, over the last decades. For intense polar lows, a significant declining trend has been observed for the Northern Hemisphere.},

Motivated by the large variety of their proposed intensification mechanisms, cloud structure, and ambient sub-synoptic environment, we use self-organising maps to classify polar lows. The method is applied to 370 polar lows in the north-eastern Atlantic, which were obtained by matching mesoscale cyclones from the ERA-5 reanalysis to polar lows registered in the STARS dataset by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. ERA-5 reproduces most of the STARS polar lows.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}We identify five different polar-low configurations which are characterised by the vertical wind shear vector, the change in the horizontal-wind vector with height, relative to the propagation direction. Four categories feature a strong shear with different orientations of the shear vector, whereas the fifth category contains conditions with weak shear. This confirms the relevance of a previously identified categorisation into forward- and reverse-shear polar lows. We expand the categorisation with right- and left-shear polar lows that propagate towards colder and warmer environments, respectively.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}For the strong-shear categories, the shear vector organises the moist-baroclinic dynamics of the systems. This is apparent in the low-pressure anomaly tilting with height against the shear vector and the main updrafts occurring along the warm front located in the forward-left direction relative to the shear vector. These main updrafts contribute to the intensification through latent heat release and are typically associated with comma-shaped clouds.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Polar-low situations with a weak shear, which often feature spirali-form clouds, occur mainly at decaying stages of the development.

In the troposphere above the planetary boundary layer zonal mean lapse rates are within 20\% of the moist adiabatic lapse rate from the equator up to about 30\textdegree N in January and 50\textdegree N in July, but are appreciably more stable in higher latitudes. The latitudinal distribution of tropospheric mean lapse rates clearly delineates two regimes in the atmosphere\textemdash a low-latitude regime where the lapse rates are essentially moist adiabatic, and a high-latitude regime where the lapse rates are essentially the critical lapse rate for baroclinic adjustment. The dividing point between the two regimes shifts from 28\textdegree N in January to 47\textdegree N in July, and the transition is less sharp in July than in January. The absence of appreciable seasonal changes in lapse rates in midlatitudes can be attributed to counterbalancing seasonal changes in the strength of moist convection and baroclinic eddies. Hemispheric mean lapse rates in the mid and lower troposphere are within 0.4 K km-1 of the moist adiabatic lapse rate in July, but are as much as 1.9 K km-1 less in January. Implications for simple climate models are discussed. A principal conclusion is that the vertical temperature structure could be well approximated by a radiative-convective equilibrium model with two critical lapse rates\textemdash the moist adiabatic lapse rate and the critical lapse rate for baroclinic adjustment.},

In continuous models this critical gradient corresponds to a transition from conditions where the dominant baroclinic instabilities are inefficient at transporting heat to conditions where they are efficient. Zonal mean meridional temperature gradients in the atmosphere are compared with this critical gradient. For averages over periods longer than a few months the observed mid and mean tropospheric gradients never appreciably exceed the critical gradient. In fact they coincide remarkably closely with it in mid and high latitudes in all seasons in spite of strong seasonal changes in the forcing. This behavior shows that a very rapid transition must exist between conditions where eddy fluxes are inefficient to conditions where they are highly efficient. Thus, the primary effect of baroclinic eddies on the meridional temperature structure is to limit the gradients from becoming appreciably supercritical. This behavior allows one to take into account quite accurately the effect of the eddy fluxes on temperature structure without calculating the eddy fluxes explicitly, simply by adjusting the temperature gradients so that they never exceed the critical value. This baroclinic adjustment process is illustrated by incorporating it into a one-dimensional energy balance climate model. The results show that the process enhances the stability of the current climate to changes in the solar constant.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In midlatitudes, the isentropic slopes are relatively close to the adjusted values in the layer from 2 to 7 km (800 to 400 mb). They also have very little variation in latitude and season, which implies that baroclinic eddy fluxes supply a strong negative feedback to changes in isentropic slopes. The vertical structure of the temperature field in the ``adjusted'' layers and the location of the layers suggest that vertical eddy heat fluxes play a significant role in this feedback process. Isentropic slopes are also calculated from simulations of the current climate by the GISS Model II GCM and the NCAR CCM2. Both models have regions of apparent baroclinic adjustment similar to that in the Northern Hemisphere atmosphere. However, compared to the observations, the agreement of the simulations with baroclinic adjustment theory is not as good, and the isentropic slopes show stronger latitudinal and seasonal variations. The discrepancies are associated primarily with errors in the models' meridional temperature gradients in the lower troposphere in midlatitudes. The seasonal changes in these gradients are much larger than in the observations, particularly in the CCM2, even though the model simulations were constrained by climatological sea surface temperatures.},

The climatic changes in this simple model are then studied in order to assess the strength of the dynamical feedback and to gain insight into how dynamical parameters may change in more sophisticated climatic models. The model shows the following qualitative changes: 1) an increase in the solar constant leads to increased static stability, decreased dynamic stability, and stronger horizontal and vertical winds; 2) an increase in the amount of atmospheric absorption leads to decreased static and dynamic stability, and stronger horizontal and vertical winds; and 3) an increase in rotation rate leads to greater static and dynamic stability, weaker horizontal winds, and stronger vertical winds. The quantitative results provide support for the common assumption that the static stability remains constant during climatic changes. Twenty-five percent changes in the external parameters cause changes in the static stability of the order of only a few tenths of a degree per kilometer. The results also show that the assumption that the horizontal eddy flux can be represented by a diffusion law with a constant eddy coefficient is a bad one, because of the strong negative feedback in the eddy fluxes.},

Some of the implied feedback mechanisms have been investigated with simple climate models and can have a sizeable impact on model sensitivity. Other dynamical feedbacks are omitted from current one-dimensional and two-dimensional models and have not yet been assessed. In particular, the impact on climate sensitivity of feedbacks associated with large-scale vertical eddy heat fluxes and {$\beta$}-effects need to be determined. It is advocated that simulations of seasonal changes in vertical and meridional dynamical fluxes and temperature structure be documented more thoroughly for general circulation models, as an aid in validating their simulations of dynamical feedbacks.

  abstract = {The ice-covered Earth instability found in energy balance models is studied with a zonal mean statistical dynamical atmospheric model coupled to a global mixed layer ocean model. The response of the model to changes in solar constant is examined in two parallel studies, one with and one without a fixed meridional heat transport (a Q-flux) being included in the ocean model. The Q-flux is derived so as to make the climate with the current value of the solar constant resemble the earth's current climate. In both cases the climate displays a hysteresis loop as the solar constant decreases and then increases, with two equilibrium states being possible for a range of values of the solar constant. In the case without a Q-flux, as in energy balance models, one state corresponds to an ice-covered Earth, and the other is partially covered. In the case with a Q-flux, because the poleward Q-flux is stronger in the Southern Hemisphere, one state corresponds to an ice-covered Northern Hemisphere, but a Southern Hemisphere that is only partially ice-covered; the other state has much reduced ice-cover in both hemispheres. In the case when the Q-flux is present, the sensitivity of the state with smaller ice-cover is about half as much, and the hysteresis loop extends over a smaller range of values of the solar constant. Also in this case there is a strong ice-covered Earth instability that sets in when the solar constant is about 13\textendash 14\% below the current value. However in the case without a Q-flux the ice-covered Earth instability virtually disappears. The different behavior is attributed to the much lower efficiency of the meridional heat transport in the case with no Q-flux. The behavior in this case may be more realistic for cold climates. The results in both cases confirm the simple analytical relation between global mean surface temperature and global ice area found in energy balance models.},

  abstract = {Abstract In order to obtain estimates of the static stability in rotating atmospheres without performing numerical integrations of the equations of motion, a simple model is developed in which the radiative flux of heat is assumed to be balanced by the fluxes of sensible beat and potential energy due to large-scale eddies. The radiative flux divergence is modeled by a linearization about the radiative equilibrium state and the dynamical fluxes are modeled by calculating correlations from stability theory and by assuming that the amplitudes are limited by nonlinear effects. From the energy equation a single algebraic equation is derived for the mean equilibrium value of the Richardson number, Ri, in the troposphere. The radiative equilibrium state is assumed to be known. Once the solution for RI is found, the mean vertical and meridional gradients of potential temperature, {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}z{$\rangle$} and {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}y{$\rangle$}, and the main properties of the mean zonal wind and eddies can be easily calculated. Even though many important fluxes are left out of the model, it is capable of giving good qualitative results because of the strong feedback in the dynamical fluxes. When applied to the earth, the model yields the values {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}z{$\rangle\approx$}+2K km-1, {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}y{$\rangle\approx-$}0.4K (100 km)-1, Ri{$\approx$}30. These values are much more realistic than can he obtained from the traditional assumption of radiative-convective equilibrium, although the static stability is still about one-half the observed value because of neglected fluxes. When applied to Mars the model yields the values {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}z{$\rangle\approx$}+2K km-1, {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}y{$\rangle\approx-$}1.2K (100 km)-1, Ri{$\approx$}10. which are in good agreement with the Mariner observations and with the numerical results of Leovy and Mintz. The destabilization of the Martian atmosphere compared to the earth's (i.e., the smaller value of Ri) is due to the much shorter radiative relaxation time on Mars, which makes the radiative fluxes more efficient at destabilizing the atmosphere. When applied to Jupiter the model yields the values {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}z{$\rangle\approx$}10-4K km-1, {$\langle\partial\theta$}/{$\partial$}y{$\rangle\approx-$}2K (10,000 km)-1. The destabilization of Jupiter's atmosphere compared to Mars' and the earth's is caused by the small horizontal temperature gradients, which in turn are due to both the large scale of Jupiter and the presence of an internal heat source. These small gradients lead to relatively weak large-scale motions, so that the dynamical fluxes are less efficient at stabilizing the atmosphere. The value of Ri found for Jupiter is subject to large error because of its sensitivity to the values of the external parameters. It may lie anywhere in the range O},

Here, the impact of removing the continental topography on the present-day ocean climate is investigated using three different climate models spanning multiple generations. An idealized study is performed where all present-day land surface topography is removed and the equilibrium change in the oceanic mean state with and without the mountains is studied. When the mountains are removed, changes found in all three models include a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and associated SST cooling in the subpolar North Atlantic. The SSTs also warm in all the models in the western North Pacific Ocean associated with a northward shift of the atmospheric jet and the Kuroshio. In the ocean interior, the magnitude of the temperature and salinity response to removing the mountains is relatively small and the sign and magnitude of the changes generally vary among the models. These different interior ocean responses are likely related to differences in the mean state of the control integrations due to differences in resolution and associated subgrid-scale mixing parameterizations. Compared to the results from 4xCO2 simulations, the interior ocean temperature changes caused by mountain removal are relatively small; however, the oceanic circulation response and Northern Hemisphere near-surface temperature changes are of a similar magnitude to the response to such radiative forcing changes.},

  abstract = {The surface of maximum wind (SMW) is used as a frame for examining spatial and temporal variability in the vertical position of fast upper tropospheric winds over the Northern Hemisphere during winter. At a given observation time in a gridded data set, the SMW is defined as the surface passing through the fastest analyzed wind above each grid node, with a vertical search domain restricted to the upper troposphere and any tropospheric jet streams extending into the lower stratosphere. Documenting how SMW pressure varies spatially and temporally guides the operational and climatological analysis of tropospheric jet streams and enables more informed interpretation of isobaric wind speed signals (i.e., isobaric speed variability can be caused by both jet core pressure changes and jet core speed changes). Using six-hourly Northern Hemisphere (NH) NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data from 1958 to 2004, the mean three-dimensional structure of the NH SMW is mapped for winter, and vertical cross sections are used to show the position of the SMW relative to the mean isotachs, the mean lapse-rate tropopause, and the mean dynamic tropopause. The Arctic Oscillation (AO) and El Ni\~no/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are identified as the leading contributors to SMW pressure variability over the NH using principal components analysis. During the AO positive phase, mean SMW pressures are decreased at high latitudes and increased at middle and subtropical latitudes. The SMW response to the AO is elliptical with the centers of pressure change displaced more equatorward over Asia and the Atlantic. During the warm phase of ENSO, eastward expansion and strengthening of the Pacific jet stream is associated with SMW pressures up to 27 hPa lower near 30\textdegree N. The relatively low SMW pressures of the east Pacific SMW are flanked, during the warm phase of ENSO, by slower upper tropospheric winds and higher SMW pressures near the equator and the Gulf of Alaska.},

The cooling centres reduced high-latitude baroclinicity, making jet cores poleward of 60\textdegree N less frequent and weaker. Over the west and central Pacific, subtropical jet stream (STJ) core probabilities remained relatively constant while core speeds increased by as much as 1.75 m/s decade-1 in association with Hadley cell intensification.

Here, we determine the causes of polar amplification using climate model simulations in which CO2 forcing is prescribed in distinct geographical regions, with the linear sum of climate responses to regional forcings replicating the response to global forcing. The degree of polar amplification depends strongly on the location of CO2 forcing. In particular, polar amplification is found to be dominated by forcing in the polar regions, specifically through positive local lapse-rate feedback, with ice-albedo and Planck feedbacks playing subsidiary roles. Extra-polar forcing is further shown to be conducive to polar warming, but given that it induces a largely uniform warming pattern through enhanced poleward heat transport, it contributes little to polar amplification. Therefore, understanding polar amplification requires primarily a better insight into local forcing and feedbacks rather than extra-polar processes.},

No other theory of the ice ages admits such a straightforward check on its validity.

  abstract = {Abstract Although El Ni\~no and global warming are both characterized by warming in the tropical upper troposphere, the latitudinal changes of the Hadley cell edge and midlatitude eddy-driven jet are opposite in sign. Using an idealized dry atmospheric model, the zonal mean circulation changes are investigated with respect to different patterns of tropical warming. Generally speaking, an equatorward shift in circulation takes place in the presence of enhanced tropical temperature gradient or narrow tropical warming, similar to the changes associated with El Ni\~no events. In contrast, the zonal mean atmospheric circulations expand or shift poleward in response to upper-tropospheric warming or broad tropical warming, resembling the changes under future global warming. The mechanisms underlying these opposite changes in circulation are investigated by comparing the dry dynamical responses to a narrow tropical warming and a broad warming as analogs for El Ni\~no and global warming. When running the idealized model in a zonally symmetric configuration in which the eddy feedback is disabled, both the narrow and broad warmings give rise to an equatorward shift of the subtropical jet. The eddy adjustment is further examined using large ensembles of transient response to a sudden switch-on of the forcing. For both narrow and broad tropical warmings, the jets move equatorward initially. In the subsequent adjustment, the initial equatorward shift is further enhanced and sustained by the low-level baroclinicity under the narrow tropical warming, whereas the initial equatorward shift transitions to a poleward shift associated with altered irreversible mixing of potential vorticity in the upper troposphere in the case of broad warming.},

Two 160-yr simulations are conducted: one with surface boundary conditions fixed at late twentieth-century values and the other with identical conditions except for Arctic sea ice, which is prescribed at late twenty-first-century values. Their difference isolates the impact of future Arctic sea ice loss upon the atmosphere. The tropospheric circulation response to the imposed ice loss resembles the negative phase of the northern annular mode, with the largest amplitude in winter, while the less well-known stratospheric response transitions from a slight weakening of the polar vortex in winter to a strengthening of the vortex in spring. The lack of a significant winter stratospheric circulation response is shown to be a consequence of largely cancelling effects from sea ice loss in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors, which drive opposite-signed changes in upward wave propagation from the troposphere to the stratosphere. Identical experiments conducted with Community Atmosphere Model, version 4, WACCM's low-top counterpart, show a weaker tropospheric response and a different stratospheric response compared to WACCM. An additional WACCM experiment in which the imposed ice loss is limited to August\textendash November reveals that autumn ice loss weakens the stratospheric polar vortex in January, followed by a small but significant tropospheric response in late winter and early spring that resembles the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, with attendant surface climate impacts.},

While we show much of Arctic amplification in surface warming to result from sea ice loss, we find that neither sea ice loss nor anthropogenic forcing overall yield trends toward colder continental temperatures. An alternate explanation of the cooling is that it represents a strong articulation of internal atmospheric variability, evidence for which is derived from model data, and physical considerations.

Two sets of simulations have been conducted, one with representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 radiative forcing and the second with RCP forcing but with Arctic sea ice nudged to its 1990 state. The difference between the two five-member sets indicates the influence of decreasing Arctic sea ice on the climate system. Within the Arctic, sea ice loss is found to be a primary driver of the surface temperature and precipitation changes. Arctic sea ice depletion also plays a dominant role in projected Atlantic meridional overturning circulation weakening and changes in North Atlantic extratropical sea surface temperature and salinity, especially in the first half century. The effect of present-day Arctic sea ice loss on Northern Hemisphere (NH) extratropical atmospheric circulation is small relative to internal variability and the future sea ice loss effect on atmospheric circulation is distinct from the projected anthropogenic change. Arctic sea ice loss warms NH extratropical continents and is an important contributor to global warming not only over high latitudes but also in the eastern United States. Last, the Arctic sea ice loss displaces the Pacific intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) equatorward and induces a ``mini-global warming'' in the tropical upper troposphere.},

However, modeling studies lack consensus on how the large-scale atmospheric circulation will respond to Arctic sea ice loss. In this study, the authors conduct a series of 200-member ensemble experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) to isolate the atmospheric response to past and future sea ice loss following the Polar-Amplification Model Inter-comparison Project (PAMIP) protocol. They find that the stratospheric polar vortex response is small compared to internal variability, which in turn influences the signal-to-noise of the wintertime tropospheric circulation response to ice loss. In particular, a strong (weak) stratospheric polar vortex induces a positive (negative) tropospheric Northern Annular Mode (and North Atlantic Oscillation), obscuring the forced component of the tropospheric response, even in 100-member averages. Stratospheric internal variability is closely tied to upward wave propagation from the troposphere and can be explained by linear wave interference between the anomalous and climatological planetary waves. Implications for the detection of recent observed trends and model realism are also presented. These results highlight the inherent uncertainty of the large-scale tropospheric circulation response to Arctic sea ice loss arising from stratospheric internal variability.},

Here the influence of Southern Ocean surface forcing on the AMOC depth is investigated using ocean-only simulations from a state-of-the-art climate model with surface forcing specified from the output of previous coupled PI and LGM simulations. In contrast to previous expectations, we find that applying LGM surface forcing in the Southern Ocean and PI surface forcing elsewhere causes the AMOC to shoal only about half as much as when LGM surface forcing is applied globally. We show that this occurs because diapycnal mixing renders the Southern Ocean overturning circulation more diabatic than previously assumed, which diminishes the influence of Southern Ocean surface buoyancy forcing on the depth of the AMOC.},

Here the stratospheric influence on the tropospheric circulation during the stratospheric final warming events is investigated through ensemble model integrations of a simple dynamical core general circulation model. When the radiative equilibrium temperature in the stratosphere alone is gradually changed from a winter to a summer profile, the model generates realistic final warmings. As in the observations, the simulated final warmings occur at different ``dates'' in different realizations. Following previously published analyses of observed final warmings, we form a climatological springtime transition and compute composite anomalies centered on the final warmings. Simulations for both non-topographic and topographic cases show that starting five days before the final warming, the stratospheric zonal wind rapidly decelerates, in association with a strong upward Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux anomaly and EP flux convergence. Precursor events of wave driven zonal-wind deceleration occur, but at different times in simulations with and without topography. The composite zonal wind anomalies for final warmings with and without topography are compared with each other and with observations. In both cases, a statistically significant zonal wind anomaly extends downward to the surface, similarly to what is observed in the Northern Hemisphere (NH). These tropospheric zonal wind anomalies are stronger in the simulations with topography. Tropospheric geopotential height anomalies across the final warming also resemble NH observations.},

Such basic states represent in a simple manner the potential vorticity distribution in the upper troposphere. Predictions of the effect of basic-state zonal variations on the amplitude and spatial structure of eddies and their associated particle displacements are made using conservation of wave action or, equivalently, the linearized ``pseudoenergy'' wave activity. The predictions are confirmed using WKB theory and linear numerical calculations. The interaction of finite-amplitude disturbances with the basic flow is also analyzed numerically using nonlinear contour-dynamical simulations.

It is found that temperature fluctuations damp to the underlying oceanic temperature with a timescale of approximately 1 day but that dynamics still play the predominant role in determining atmospheric heat flux, due to eddy mixing lengths within the storm track of {$\leq$} 5\textdegree{} latitude. These results are confirmed by the favorable comparison of the PDFs of the model-generated and observed temperature fluctuations and heat flux. The implications of strong thermal damping in the lower troposphere are discussed and speculations are made regarding the effect of such damping upon baroclinic eddy life cycles and the general circulation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Numerical simulations of the inviscid, nonlinear life cycle of wave packets emerging from a zonally localized initial disturbance on a baroclinically unstable jet are studied. The study reveals the following. 1) Linear wave packet theory accurately bounds the upstream and downstream development of the synoptic disturbance throughout the nonlinear evolution. 2) The short, shallow, slowly propagating waves at the upstream fringe of the wave packet equilibrate at low amplitudes and never come to dominate the wave packet evolution. 3) Upslxeampropagating Rossby waves are excited in the vicinity of the synoptic wave packet, which cause the generation of strong barotropic jets mostly upstream of the dominant body of the wave packet. This prevents the barotropicgovernor mechanism from limiting the growth Of the disturbances in the main body of the packet; the main equilibration mechanism is a simple homogenization of the lower-layer potential vorticity in the vicinity of the wave packet. 4) The waves that reach the largest amplitude are the weakly growing waves at the leading edge of the wave packet. These have group speeds comparable to the upper-level jet maximum and wavelengthscomparable to that of the most unstable normal mode, but are slowly growing. The growing leading-edge disturbances leave behind a zonally spreading finite-amplitude disturbance with nearly zero phase speed; there is no evidence of a barotropic decay stage.},

  abstract = {It has been previously proposed that two El Ni\~no (EN) regimes, strong and moderate, exist but the historical observational record is too short to establish this conclusively. Here, 1200 years of simulations with the GFDL CM2.1 model allowed us to demonstrate their existence in this model and, by showing that the relevant dynamics are also evident in observations, we present a stronger case for their existence in nature. In CM2.1, the robust bimodal probability distribution of equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) indices during EN peaks provides evidence for the existence of the regimes, which is also supported by a cluster analysis of these same indices. The observations agree with this distribution, with the EN of 1982\textendash 1983 and 1997\textendash 1998 corresponding to the strong EN regime and all the other observed EN to the moderate regime. The temporal evolution of various indices during the observed strong EN agrees very well with the events in CM2.1, providing further validation of this model as a proxy for nature. The two regimes differ strongly in the magnitude of the eastern Pacific warming but not much in the central Pacific. Observations and model agree in the existence of a finite positive threshold in the SST anomaly above which the zonal wind response to warming is strongly enhanced. Such nonlinearity in the Bjerknes feedback, which increases the growth rate of EN events if they reach sufficiently large amplitude, is very likely the essential mechanism that gives rise to the existence of the two EN regimes. Oceanic nonlinear advection does not appear essential for the onset of strong EN. The threshold nonlinearity could make the EN regimes very sensitive to stochastic forcing. Observations and model agree that the westerly wind stress anomaly in the central equatorial Pacific in late boreal summer has a substantial role determining the EN regime in the following winter and it is suggested that a stochastic component at this time was key for the development of the strong EN towards the end of 1982.},

  abstract = {The existence of two regimes for El Ni\~no (EN) events, moderate and strong, has been previously shown in the GFDL CM2.1 climate model and also suggested in observations. The two regimes have been proposed to originate from the nonlinearity in the Bjerknes feedback, associated with a threshold in sea surface temperature (\$\$T\_c\$\$) that needs to be exceeded for deep atmospheric convection to occur in the eastern Pacific. However, although the recent 2015\textendash 16 EN event provides a new data point consistent with the sparse strong EN regime, it is not enough to statistically reject the null hypothesis of a unimodal distribution based on observations alone. Nevertheless, we consider the possibility suggestive enough to explore it with a simple theoretical model based on the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback. In this study, we implemented this nonlinear mechanism in the recharge-discharge (RD) ENSO model and show that it is sufficient to produce the two EN regimes, i.e. a bimodal distribution in peak surface temperature (T) during EN events. The only modification introduced to the original RD model is that the net damping is suppressed when T exceeds \$\$T\_c\$\$, resulting in a weak nonlinearity in the system. Due to the damping, the model is globally stable and it requires stochastic forcing to maintain the variability. The sustained low-frequency component of the stochastic forcing plays a key role for the onset of strong EN events (i.e. for \$\$T{$>$}T\_c\$\$), at least as important as the precursor positive heat content anomaly (h). High-frequency forcing helps some EN events to exceed \$\$T\_c\$\$, increasing the number of strong events, but the rectification effect is small and the overall number of EN events is little affected by this forcing. Using the Fokker\textendash Planck equation, we show how the bimodal probability distribution of EN events arises from the nonlinear Bjerknes feedback and also propose that the increase in the net feedback with increasing T is a necessary condition for bimodality in the RD model. We also show that the damping strength determines both the adjustment time-scale and equilibrium value of the ensemble spread associated with the stochastic forcing.},

In this study we gathered and synthesised a large diversity of in situ observations to provide a new assessment of this event from a modern perspective. In contrast to the extreme 1982\textendash 1983 and 1997\textendash 1998 events, this very strong ``coastal El Ni\~no'' in early 1925 was characterised by warm conditions in the FEP, but cool conditions elsewhere in the central Pacific. Hydrographic and tide-gauge data indicate that downwelling equatorial Kelvin waves had little role in its initiation. Instead, ship data indicate an~abrupt onset of strong northerly winds across the equator and the strengthening/weakening of the intertropical convergence zones (ITCZ) south/north of the equator. Observations indicate lack of external atmospheric forcing by the Panama gap jet and the south Pacific anticyclone and suggest that the coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere feedback dynamics associated with the ITCZs, northerly winds, and the north\textendash south SST asymmetry in the FEP lead to the enhancement of the seasonal cycle that produced this EN event. We propose that the cold conditions in the western-central equatorial Pacific, through its teleconnection effects on the FEP, helped destabilize the ITCZ and enhanced the meridional ocean\textendash atmosphere feedback, as well as helping produce the very strong coastal rainfall. This is indicated by the nonlinear relation between the Piura river record at 5\textdegree S and the SST difference between the FEP and the western-central equatorial Pacific, a stability proxy. In summary, there are two types of EN events with very strong impacts in the FEP, both apparently associated with nonlinear convective feedbacks but with very different dynamics: the very strong warm ENSO events like 1982\textendash 1983 and 1997\textendash 1998, and the very strong ``coastal'' EN events like 1925.},

The canopy has a single layer, whose albedo and bulk coefficients are evaluated on the basis of a multilayer canopy model.

The interception evaporation from canopy and the transpiration on the basis of photosynthesis are treated. A simplified TOPMODEL is used to calculate runoff.

Besides, the snowmelt, the refreeze of snowmelt, and the freeze of rainfall in snow are taken into consideration. It is found in the PILPS 2e experiment that some parameters in the runoff scheme, such as the surface hydraulic conductivity and the river channel fraction, have a considerable impact on the partitioning of the surface runoff and the base flow. The snow albedo is prognosticated from the time passage since last snowfall and the snow temperature.

However, there are few comprehensive studies on the related risks with regard to the differences between relatively weak levels of warming, including the recent targets of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) of 1.5 \textdegree C or 2 \textdegree C. The present study investigates the impacts of 1.5 \textdegree C and 2 \textdegree C warming on aridification and their non-linearity based on the relationship between available water and energy at the Earth's terrestrial surface. Large multi-model ensembles with a 4000-model-year in total are sourced from the Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis, and Projected Impacts (HAPPI) project. Results demonstrate that 2 \textdegree C warming results in more frequent dry states in the Amazon Basin, western Europe, and southern Africa, and a limited warming to 1.5 \textdegree C will mitigate aridification and increase the frequency of extreme dry-year in these regions. In the Mediterranean region, a significant acceleration of aridification is found from the 1.5 \textdegree C to 2 \textdegree C warming projections, which indicates a need to limit the warming by 1.5 \textdegree C. A substantial portion of Asia is projected to become increasingly humid under both 1.5 \textdegree C and 2 \textdegree C warming scenarios. In some geographic regions, such as Australia, a strong nonlinear shift of aridification is found as 2 \textdegree C warming results in shift to wetter state contrast to significant increases in aridity and dry-year frequency at the weaker level of warming. The results suggest that the responses of regional precipitation to global warming cause the aridity changes, but their nonlinear behaviors along with different warming levels should be assessed carefully, in particular, to incorporate the additional 0.5 \textdegree C warming.},

Initial results from simulations of the summer 1988 drought over the central United States indicate that limited-area models forced by large-scale information at the lateral boundaries reproduce bulk temporal and spatial characteristics of meteorological fields. In particular, the 500 hPa height field time average and temporal variability are generally well simulated by all participating models. Model simulations of precipitation episodes vary depending on the scale of the dynamical forcing. Organized synoptic-scale precipitation systems are simulated deterministically in that precipitation occurs at close to the same time and location as observed (although amounts may vary from observations). Episodes of mesoscale and convective precipitation are represented in a more stochastic sense, with less precise agreement in temporal and spatial patterns. Simulated surface energy fluxes show broad similarity with the First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Field Experiment (FIFE) observations in their temporal evolution and time average diurnal cycle. Intermodel differences in midday Bowen ratio tend to be closely associated with precipitation differences. Differences in daily maximum temperatures also are linked to Bowen ratio differences, indicating strong local, surface influence on this field. Although some models have bias with respect to FIFE observations, all tend to reproduce the synoptic variability of observed daily maximum and minimum temperatures. Results also reveal the advantage of an intercomparison in exposing common tendencies of models despite their differences in convective and surface parameterizations and different methods of assimilating lateral boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Earth's midlatitudes are dominated by regions of large atmospheric weather variability\textemdash often referred to as storm tracks\textemdash{} which influence the distribution of temperature, precipitation and wind in the extratropics. Comprehensive climate models forced by increased greenhouse gas emissions suggest that under global warming the storm tracks shift poleward. While the poleward shift is a robust response across most models, there is currently no consensus on what the underlying dynamical mechanism is. Here we present a new perspective on the poleward shift, which is based on a Lagrangian view of the storm tracks. We show that in addition to a poleward shift in the genesis latitude of the storms, associated with the shift in baroclinicity, the latitudinal displacement of cyclonic storms increases under global warming. This is ~achieved by ~applying a storm-tracking algorithm to an ensemble of CMIP5 models. The increased latitudinal propagation in a warmer climate is shown to be a result of stronger upper-level winds and increased atmospheric water vapour. These changes in the propagation characteristics of the storms can have a significant impact on midlatitude climate.},

In this study, the spatial structure of the storm tracks is examined by tracking transient cyclones in an idealized GCM with a localized ocean heat flux. The localized atmospheric response is decomposed in terms of a time- and zonal-mean background flow, a stationary wave, and a transient eddy field. The Lagrangian tracks are used to construct cyclone composites and perform a spatially varying PV budget. Three distinct mechanisms that contribute to the poleward tilt emerge: transient nonlinear advection, latent heat release, and stationary advection. The downstream evolution of the PV composites shows the different role played by the stationary wave in each region. In the region where the tilt is maximized, all three mechanisms contribute to the poleward propagation of the low-level PV anomaly associated with the cyclone. Upstream of that region, the stationary wave is opposing the former two, and the poleward tendency is therefore reduced. Finally, through repeated experiments with enhanced strength of the heating source, it is shown that the poleward deflection of the storms enhances when the amplitude of the stationary wave increases.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A potential vorticity tendency analysis of the cyclone composites highlights two leading mechanisms responsible for enhanced poleward motion: nonlinear horizontal advection and diabatic heating associated with latent heat release. Our results imply that for a 4 K rise in the global mean surface temperature, the mean poleward displacement of cyclones increases by about 0.85\textdegree{} of latitude, and this occurs in addition to a poleward shift of about 0.6\textdegree{} in their mean genesis latitude.

  abstract = {Recent observations of ultra-hot Jupiters with dayside temperatures in excess of 2500 K have found evidence for new physical processes at play in their atmospheres. In this work, we investigate the effects of the dissociation of molecular hydrogen and recombination of atomic hydrogen on the atmospheric circulation of ultra-hot Jupiters. To do so, we incorporate these effects into a general circulation model (GCM) for hot Jupiter atmospheres and run a large suite of models varying the incident stellar flux, rotation period, and strength of frictional drag. We find that including hydrogen dissociation and recombination reduces the fractional day-to-night temperature contrast of ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres and causes the speed of the equatorial jet to decrease in simulations with fixed rotation. This is because the large energy input required for hydrogen dissociation cools the dayside of the planet, and the energy released due to hydrogen recombination warms the nightside. The resulting decrease in the day-to-night temperature contrast reduces the day-to-night pressure gradient that drives the circulation, resulting in weaker wind speeds. The results from our GCM experiments qualitatively agree with previous theory that found that the fractional day\textendash night temperature contrast of ultra-hot Jupiters should decrease with increasing equilibrium temperature owing to hydrogen dissociation and recombination. Lastly, we compute full-phase light curves from our suite of GCM experiments, finding that the reduced day-to-night temperature contrast in ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres causes a smaller phase curve amplitude.

  abstract = {Underestimation of the proportion of supercooled liquid in mixed-phase clouds in climate models has called into question its impact on Arctic climate change. We show that correcting for this bias in the CESM model can either enhance or reduce Arctic amplification depending on the microphysical characteristics of the clouds as a corollary to the cloud phase feedback. Replacement of ice with liquid in the cloud phase feedback results in more downward longwave radiation, which is effectively trapped as heat at the surface in the Arctic due to its unique stable stratification conditions, and this ultimately leads to a more positive lapse rate feedback. The larger the ice particles are to begin with, the stronger Arctic amplification becomes due to the lower precipitation efficiency of liquid droplets compared to ice crystals. Our results emphasize the importance of realistic representations of microphysical processes in mixed-phase clouds, particularly in the Arctic.},

Additionally, the common practice of representing boundary-layer turbulence, shallow convection, and deep convection by discontinuously different parameterizations schemes, each with its own set of parameters, has contributed to the proliferation of adjustable parameters in large-scale models. Here we lay the theoretical foundations for an extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) scheme that has explicit time-dependence and memory of subgrid-scale variables and is designed to represent all subgrid-scale turbulence and convection, from boundary layer dynamics to deep convection, in a unified manner. Coherent up and downdrafts in the scheme are represented as prognostic plumes that interact with their environment and potentially with each other through entrainment and detrainment. The more isotropic turbulence in their environment is represented through diffusive fluxes, with diffusivities obtained from a turbulence kinetic energy budget that consistently partitions turbulence kinetic energy between plumes and environment. The cross-sectional area of up and downdrafts satisfies a prognostic continuity equation, which allows the plumes to cover variable and arbitrarily large fractions of a large-scale grid box and to have life cycles governed by their own internal dynamics. Relatively simple preliminary proposals for closure parameters are presented and are shown to lead to a successful simulation of shallow convection, including a time-dependent life cycle.},

One key component of IMERG is the morphing algorithm, which uses motion vectors to perform quasi-Lagrangian interpolation to fill in gaps in the passive microwave precipitation field using motion vectors. Up to IMERG V05, the motion vectors were derived from the large-scale motions of infrared observations of cloud tops. This study details the changes introduced in IMERG V06 to derive motion vectors from large-scale motions of selected atmospheric variables in numerical models, which allow IMERG estimates to be extended from the 60\textdegree N\textendash 60\textdegree S latitude band to the entire globe. Evaluation against both instantaneous passive microwave retrievals and ground measurements demonstrates the general improvement in the precipitation field of the new approach. Most of the model variables tested exhibited similar performance, but total precipitable water vapor was chosen as the source of the motion vectors for IMERG V06 due to its competitive performance and global completeness. Continuing assessments will provide further insights into possible refinements of this revised morphing scheme in future versions of IMERG.},

In LES coupled to a slab ocean with interactive sea surface temperatures (SST), the surface latent heat flux (LHF) is constrained by the surface energy balance and only strengthens modestly under warming. Consequently, the MBL in warmer climates is shallower than in corresponding fixed-SST LES, in which LHF strengthens excessively and the MBL typically deepens. The inferred shortwave (SW) cloud feedback with a closed energy balance is weakly positive for cumulus clouds. It is more strongly positive for stratocumulus clouds, with a magnitude that increases with warming. Stratocumulus clouds generally break up above to warming, or above a four to eightfold increase in concentrations. This occurs because the MBL mixing driven by cloud-top longwave (LW) cooling weakens as the LW opacity of the free troposphere increases. The stratocumulus breakup triggers an abrupt and large SST increase and MBL deepening, which cannot occur in fixed-SST experiments. SW cloud radiative effects generally weaken while the lower-tropospheric stability increases under warming\textemdash the reverse of their empirical relation in the present climate. The MBL is deeper and stratocumulus persists into warmer climates if large-scale subsidence decreases as the climate warms. The contrasts between experiments with interactive SST and fixed SST highlight the importance of a closed surface energy balance for obtaining realizable responses of MBL clouds to warming.},

In those studies, the NAO and the northeast Pacific climate variability are considered as two separate modes that explain the variance over the North Atlantic sector and the east Pacific\textendash North American sector, respectively. A newly identified low-frequency atmospheric regime\textemdash the Western Hemisphere (WH) circulation pattern\textemdash provides a unique example of a mode of variability that accounts for variance over the whole North Atlantic\textendash North American\textendash North Pacific sector. The role of synoptic waves in the formation and maintenance of the WH pattern is investigated using the ECMWF reanalysis datasets. Persistent WH events are characterized by the propagation of quasi-stationary Rossby waves across the North Pacific\textendash North American\textendash North Atlantic regions and by associated storm-track anomalies. The eddy-induced low-frequency height anomalies maintain the anomalous low-frequency ridge over the Gulf of Alaska, which induces more equatorward propagation of synoptic waves on its downstream side. The eddy forcing favors the strengthening of the midlatitude jet and the deepening of the mid-to-high-latitude trough over the North Atlantic, whereas the deepening of the trough over eastern North America mostly arises from the quasi-stationary waves propagating from the North Pacific. A case study for the 2013/14 winter is examined to illustrate the downstream development of synoptic waves. The roles of synoptic waves in the formation and maintenance of the WH pattern and in linking the northeast Pacific ridge anomaly with the NAO are discussed.},

  abstract = {Comprehensive climate models exhibit a large spread in the magnitude of projected poleward eddy-driven jet shift in response to warming. The spread has been connected to the radiative response to warming. To understand how different radiative assumptions alone affect the jet shift in response to warming, we introduce a new clear-sky longwave radiation hierarchy that spans idealized (gray versus four bands; without or with interactive water vapor) through comprehensive (correlated-k) radiation in the same general circulation model. The new hierarchy is used in an aquaplanet configuration to explore the impact of radiation on the jet stream response to warming, independent of mean surface temperature and meridional surface temperature gradient responses. The gray radiation scheme produces a split jet and its eddy-driven jet shifts equatorward as climate warms, whereas the storm track shifts equatorward then poleward. Including four longwave bands leads to a merged jet that shifts slightly poleward with warming, and the storm track shifts monotonically poleward. Including interactive water vapor makes the poleward jet shift comparable to the jet shift with comprehensive radiation and interactive water vapor. These jet and storm track differences are linked to the radiation response of the stratospheric temperature, the tropopause height, and the meridional gradient of the radiative forcing to warming. Dynamically, the equatorward jet shift with the gray scheme is consistent with reduced wave reflection on the poleward flank of the jet, whereas the poleward jet shift with the other schemes is consistent with increased eddy length scale that favors equatorward wave propagation.},

In particular, we investigate buoyant acceleration, defined as the sum of the Archimedean buoyancy B and an associated perturbation pressure gradient. For the case of a uniform spherical thermal, the anomaly fluid accelerates at 2B/3, extending the textbook result for the induced mass of a solid sphere to the case of a fluid sphere. For a more general ellipsoidal thermal, we show that the buoyant acceleration is a simple analytical function of the ellipsoid's aspect ratio. The relevance of these idealized uniform-density results to turbulent thermals is explored by analyzing direct numerical simulations of thermals at a Reynolds number (Re) of 6300. We find that our results fully characterize a thermal's initial motion over a distance comparable to its length. Beyond this buoyancy-dominated regime, a thermal develops an ellipsoidal vortex circulation and begins to entrain environmental fluid. Our analytical expressions do not describe the total acceleration of this mature thermal, but they still accurately relate the buoyant acceleration to the thermal's mean Archimedean buoyancy and aspect ratio. Thus, our analytical formulas provide a simple and direct means of estimating the buoyant acceleration of turbulent thermals.},

For the radiative and turbulent surface fluxes, both the amplitude and shape of the diurnal cycles vary considerably among different reanalyses. Near-surface temperature, specific humidity, and wind speed in the reanalyses all feature small diurnal ranges, which, in most cases, fall within the uncertainties of the observed cycle. A skill score approach revealed the superiority of the ERA-Interim reanalysis in reproducing the observed diurnal cycles. An explanation for the shortcomings in the reanalyses is their failure to capture the diurnal cycle in cloud cover fraction, which leads to errors in other quantities as well.

  abstract = {Forty years ago, climate scientists predicted the Arctic to be one of Earth's most sensitive climate regions and thus extremely vulnerable to increased CO2. The rapid and unprecedented changes observed in the Arctic confirm this prediction. Especially significant, observed sea ice loss is altering the exchange of mass, energy, and momentum between the Arctic Ocean and atmosphere. As an important component of air\textendash sea exchange, surface turbulent fluxes are controlled by vertical gradients of temperature and humidity between the surface and atmosphere, wind speed, and surface roughness, indicating that they respond to other forcing mechanisms such as atmospheric advection, ocean mixing, and radiative flux changes. The exchange of energy between the atmosphere and surface via surface turbulent fluxes in turn feeds back on the Arctic surface energy budget, sea ice, clouds, boundary layer temperature and humidity, and atmospheric and oceanic circulations. Understanding and attributing variability and trends in surface turbulent fluxes is important because they influence the magnitude of Arctic climate change, sea ice cover variability, and the atmospheric circulation response to increased CO2. This paper reviews current knowledge of Arctic Ocean surface turbulent fluxes and their effects on climate. We conclude that Arctic Ocean surface turbulent fluxes are having an increasingly consequential influence on Arctic climate variability in response to strong regional trends in the air-surface temperature contrast related to the changing character of the Arctic sea ice cover. Arctic Ocean surface turbulent energy exchanges are not smooth and steady but rather irregular and episodic, and consideration of the episodic nature of surface turbulent fluxes is essential for improving Arctic climate projections.},

Researchers worldwide are analyzing the model output and will produce results likely to underlie the forthcoming Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Unprecedented in scale and attracting interest from all major climate modeling groups, CMIP5 includes ``long term'' simulations of twentieth-century climate and projections for the twenty-first century and beyond. Conventional atmosphere\textendash ocean global climate models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity are for the first time being joined by more recently developed Earth system models under an experiment design that allows both types of models to be compared to observations on an equal footing. Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of ``near term'' simulations focusing on recent decades and the future to year 2035. These ``decadal predictions'' are initialized based on observations and will be used to explore the predictability of climate and to assess the forecast system's predictive skill. The CMIP5 experiment design also allows for participation of stand-alone atmospheric models and includes a variety of idealized experiments that will improve understanding of the range of model responses found in the more complex and realistic simulations. An exceptionally comprehensive set of model output is being collected and made freely available to researchers through an integrated but distributed data archive.

  abstract = {Arctic amplification (AA) is a coupled atmosphere-sea ice-ocean process. This understanding has evolved from the early concept of AA, as a consequence of snow-ice line progressions, through more than a century of research that has clarified the relevant processes and driving mechanisms of AA. The predictions made by early modeling studies, namely the fall/winter maximum, bottom-heavy structure, the prominence of surface albedo feedback, and the importance of stable stratification have withstood the scrutiny of multi-decadal observations and more complex models. Yet, the uncertainty in Arctic climate projections is larger than in any other region of the planet, making the assessment of high-impact, near-term regional changes difficult or impossible. Reducing this large spread in Arctic climate projections requires a quantitative process understanding. This manuscript aims to build such an understanding by synthesizing current knowledge of AA and to produce a set of recommendations to guide future research. It briefly reviews the history of AA science, summarizes observed Arctic changes, discusses modeling approaches and feedback diagnostics, and assesses the current understanding of the most relevant feedbacks to AA. These sections culminate in a conceptual model of the fundamental physical mechanisms causing AA and a collection of recommendations to accelerate progress towards reduced uncertainty in Arctic climate projections. Our conceptual model highlights the need to account for local feedback and remote process interactions within the context of the annual cycle to constrain projected AA. We recommend raising the priority of Arctic climate sensitivity research, improving the accuracy of Arctic surface energy budget observations, rethinking climate feedback definitions, coordinating new model experiments and intercomparisons, and further investigating the role of episodic variability in AA.},

  abstract = {This study examines the influence of moisture, baroclinicity, and static stability on developing disturbances at high latitudes by utilising an idealised baroclinic channel model. The set-up is composed of environmental baroclinicity defined by a zonally uniform jet in thermal wind balance with a meridional temperature gradient and moisture content defined by relative humidity profiles. Initiation of disturbance growth is achieved by superimposing a weak, surface-based warm-cored cyclonic disturbance to the set-up. The experiments show that the disturbance is able to amplify within such an environment in the absence of an upper-level perturbation, surface fluxes, friction, or radiation. Separation between developing and non-developing disturbances is feasible by considering the baroclinic and diabatic contributions to eddy available potential energy. Developing disturbances show a clear diabatic dominance during the early stage of development, whereas experiments lacking this diabatic boost fail to intensify within a 3-day time window. A comparison with the conceptual framework of the Diabatic Rossby Vortex (DRV) growth mechanism provides insight into the dynamical pathway potentially underlying the enhanced amplification. The emerging disturbance qualitatively resembles the postulated DRV structure, the major difference being a decreased depth in comparison with simulated and observed DRVs in midlatitudes. A suit of sensitivity experiments examines the range of atmospheric conditions in which enhanced amplification by diabatic processes is possible. Threshold values for moisture content and isentropic slopes are identified.},

This degradation is predicted to have consequences for many processes, which previous modelling studies have suggested would occur gradually. Here we project that soil moisture will decrease abruptly (within a few months) in response to permafrost degradation over large areas of the present-day permafrost region, based on analysis of transient climate change simulations performed using a state-of-the-art regional climate model. This regime shift is reflected in abrupt increases in summer near-surface temperature and convective precipitation, and decreases in relative humidity and surface runoff. Of particular relevance to northern systems are changes to the bearing capacity of the soil due to increased drainage, increases in the potential for intense rainfall events and increases in lightning frequency. Combined with increases in forest fuel combustibility, these are projected to abruptly and substantially increase the severity of wildfires, which constitute one of the greatest risks to northern ecosystems, communities and infrastructures. The fact that these changes are projected to occur abruptly further increases the challenges associated with climate change adaptation and potential retrofitting measures.},

  abstract = {The orographic effects of Antarctica on the atmospheric circulation are investigated through idealized orographic reduction numerical experiments performed using the NCAR CAM5 model. The investigation shows that, in the absence of the orography over the continent, the troposphere becomes warmer and wetter, the sea level pressure reduces, and the precipitation is enhanced. Furthermore, over the continent, the height of the tropopause increases, the stationary waves become weaker, and the southern polar jet gets more energetic. The radiative budget also gets altered, with more outgoing longwave radiation over the continent, which drives circulation changes beneath. The mean atmospheric circulation is weakened with weakening and shrinking of the Polar cell and widening of the Ferrel cell in the Southern Hemisphere, which decreases the contribution by mean flow towards poleward energy transport. An increase in transient eddy due to an enhancement of baroclinicity over the region supports poleward energy transport and compensates for a higher outgoing longwave radiation over the Antarctic continent. These significant changes observed in idealized Antarctic orographic reduction demonstrate the importance of the present Antarctic orography and ice cover for the Southern Hemisphere. The impact of these changes provides valuable insights on the future role of Antarctic orography on the earth's climate system from a fundamental point of view.},

However, due to the coupled nature of the climate system and various feedbacks present, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. The present study attempts to investigate the potential effects of the model projected Antarctic sea-ice loss on the climate system and understand the underlying mechanism causing such changes using coupled model simulations. The investigation suggests that the projected sea-ice loss will result in the localized surface warming accompanied with tropospheric warming that will be experienced globally. The surface evaporation will enhance, accompanied by an increase in the precipitation and cloud cover around Antarctica's coastal periphery, with marginal changes observed over the continent's interiors. The strength of the atmospheric circulation in the Southern Hemisphere will change significantly, resulting in an enhancement in the Polar cell and katabatic flow accompanied by a marginal reduction in the Ferrel and Hadley cells, causing an equatorial shift in the jet's position. The eddy transport will also significantly weaken, leading to an overall reduction in the poleward energy transport at higher latitudes. These atmospheric circulation changes are essentially driven by the radiative budget, with more absorbed short-wave radiation reducing the poleward transport requirements. Compared to the reported uncoupled simulations studies, the remote global influence of sea ice loss noted in these coupled simulations which extends up to the Arctic highlights the strong pole-to-pole connections in the climate system through atmospheric and oceanic circulations.},

  abstract = {Arctic sea ice has decreased substantially over recent decades, a trend projected to continue. Shrinking ice reduces surface albedo, leading to greater surface solar absorption, thus amplifying warming and driving further melt. This sea-ice albedo feedback (SIAF) is a key driver of Arctic climate change and an important uncertainty source in climate model projections. Using an ensemble of models, we demonstrate an emergent relationship between future SIAF and an observable version of SIAF in the current climate's seasonal cycle. This relationship is robust in constraining SIAF over the coming decades (Pearson's r\,=\,0.76), and then it degrades. The degradation occurs because some models begin producing ice-free conditions, signalling a transition to a new ice regime. The relationship is strengthened when models with unrealistically thin historical ice are excluded. Because of this tight relationship, reducing model errors in the current climate's seasonal SIAF and ice thickness can narrow SIAF spread under climate change.},

It resembles the NAO in many respects; but its primary center of action covers more of the Arctic, giving it a more zonally symmetric appearance. Coupled to strong fluctuations at the 50-hPa level on the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal time scales, this ``Arctic Oscillation'' (AO) can be interpreted as the surface signature of modulations in the strength of the polar vortex aloft. It is proposed that the zonally asymmetric surface air temperature and mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies observed in association with the AO may be secondary baroclinic features induced by the land-sea contrasts. The same modal structure is mirrored in the pronounced trends in winter and springtime surface air temperature, sea-level pressure, and 50-hPa height over the past 30 years: parts of Eurasia have warmed by as much as several K, sea-level pressure over parts of the Arctic has fallen by 4 hPa, and the core of the lower stratospheric polar vortex has cooled by several K. These trends can be interpreted as the development of a systematic bias in one of the atmosphere's dominant, naturally occurring modes of variability.},

The NAM and NBAM have very different signatures in large-scale NH climate variability. The NAM emerges as the leading principal component (PC) time series of the zonal-mean kinetic energy. It dominates the variance in the wave fluxes of momentum, projects weakly onto the eddy kinetic energy and wave fluxes of heat, and can be modeled as Gaussian red noise with a time scale of \textasciitilde 10 days. In contrast, the NBAM emerges as the leading PC time series of the eddy kinetic energy. It is most clearly identified when the planetary-scale waves are filtered from the data, dominates the variance in the synoptic-scale eddy kinetic energy and wave fluxes of heat, and has a relatively weak signature in the zonal-mean kinetic energy and the wave fluxes of momentum. The NBAM is marked by weak but significant enhanced spectral power on time scales of \textasciitilde 20\textendash 25 days.

It is argued that variability in the Southern Hemisphere extratropical flow can be viewed in the context of two distinct and largely independent structures, both of which exhibit a high degree of annularity: 1) a barotropic structure that dominates the variance in the zonal-mean kinetic energy and 2) a baroclinic structure that dominates the variance in the eddy kinetic energy. The former structure corresponds to the southern annular mode (SAM) and has been extensively examined in the literature. The latter structure emerges as the leading principal component time series of eddy kinetic energy and has received seemingly little attention in previous work. The two structures play very different roles in cycling energy through the extratropical troposphere. The SAM is associated primarily with variability in the meridional propagation of wave activity, has a surprisingly weak signature in the eddy fluxes of heat, and can be modeled as Gaussian red noise with an e-folding time scale of approximately 10 days. The baroclinic annular structure is associated primarily with variations in the amplitude of vertically propagating waves, has a very weak signature in the wave fluxes of momentum, and exhibits marked quasi periodicity on time scales of approximately 25\textendash 30 days. Implications for large-scale climate variability are discussed.},

We construct an idealized midlatitude zonal jet and perform two experiments: one control simulation with no inertial instability and one experiment with inertial instability simulating its release.

The hypothesis is a generalization of the fixed-anvil temperature hypothesis to the global atmospheric circulation. It posits that the depth of robust mixing by extratropical eddies is limited by radiative cooling by water vapor\textemdash and hence saturation vapor pressures\textemdash in areas of sinking motion. The hypothesis implies that 1) radiative cooling by water vapor constrains the vertical structure and amplitude of extratropical dynamics and 2) the extratropical tropopause should remain at roughly the same temperature and lift under global warming. Here the authors test the hypothesis in numerical simulations run on an aquaplanet general circulation model (GCM) and a coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean GCM (AOGCM). The extratropical cloud-top height, wave driving, and lapse-rate tropopause all shift upward but remain at roughly the same temperature when the aquaplanet GCM is forced by uniform surface warming of +4 K and when the AOGCM is forced by RCP8.5 scenario emissions. ``Locking'' simulations run on the aquaplanet GCM further reveal that 1) holding the water vapor concentrations input into the radiation code fixed while increasing surface temperatures strongly constrains the rise in the extratropical tropopause, whereas 2) increasing the water vapor concentrations input into the radiation code while holding surface temperatures fixed leads to robust rises in the extratropical tropopause. Together, the results suggest that roughly invariant extratropical tropopause temperatures constitutes an additional ``robust response'' of the climate system to global warming.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract The extratropical annular modes are coupled with a distinct pattern of climate anomalies that spans the circulation of the tropical troposphere. The signature of the annular modes in the tropical troposphere exhibits a high degree of equatorial symmetry. It is associated with upper-tropospheric zonal wind anomalies centered about the equator, midtropospheric temperature anomalies located {$\sim$}20\textdegree N and 20\textdegree S, and opposing mean meridional circulation anomalies that span the subtropics of both hemispheres. The linkages between the annular modes and the tropical circulation are only evident during the cold season months, and are most robust in association with the Northern Hemisphere annular mode (NAM). The coupling between the annular modes and the circulation of the tropical troposphere is consistent with forcing by waves originating at extratropical latitudes. Both annular modes are characterized by anomalies in the eddy momentum flux convergence at tropical latitudes that act to reinforce the changes in the tropical wind and temperature fields. The most pronounced tropical anomalies lag indices of the annular modes by {$\sim$}2 weeks and are found over the eastern tropical Pacific, where climatological westerlies permit extratropical waves to propagate into the deep Tropics. The linkages between the NAM and the tropical tropospheric circulation are most pronounced during the cold phase of the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation cycle. The recent trend in the NAM is linearly congruent with a {$\sim$}0.1-K cooling of the tropical troposphere over the past two decades during the Northern Hemisphere winter season.},

  abstract = {The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), one of the best studied palaeoclimatic intervals, offers an excellent opportunity to investigate how the climate system responds to changes in greenhouse gases and the cryosphere. Previous work has sought to constrain the magnitude and pattern of glacial cooling from palaeothermometers1,2, but the uneven distribution of the proxies, as well as their uncertainties, has challenged the construction of a full-field view of the LGM climate state. Here we combine a large collection of geochemical proxies for sea surface temperature with an isotope-enabled climate model ensemble to produce a field reconstruction of LGM temperatures using data assimilation. The reconstruction is validated with withheld proxies as well as independent ice core and speleothem {$\delta$}18O measurements. Our assimilated product provides a constraint on global mean LGM cooling of -6.1 degrees Celsius (95 per cent confidence interval: -6.5 to -5.7 degrees Celsius). Given assumptions concerning the radiative forcing of greenhouse gases, ice sheets and mineral dust aerosols, this cooling translates to an equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3.4 degrees Celsius (2.4\textendash 4.5 degrees Celsius), a value that is higher than previous LGM-based estimates but consistent with the traditional consensus range of 2\textendash 4.5 degrees Celsius3,4.},

  abstract = {Abstract Regional climate, anomalies associated with year-to-year changes in the tropospheric zonal-mean zonal wind (\=u) are examined. This study focuses on the wintertime Northern Hemisphere extratropics and compares seasonal mean anomalies associated with \=u to those associated with the El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation during the 1947\textendash 94 period. Dynamical model experiments indicate that a single zonal index, characterized by out-of-phase \=u anomalies at 35\textdegree{} and 55\textdegree N, is of primary importance for zonal flow/stationary wave interactions in the Northern Hemisphere extratropies. Such fluctuations in the zonal-mean zonal flow are shown to occur independently of tropical SST variability, consistent with earlier studies. Dynamical model experiments and regression analyses of the historical data indicate that such a zonal index explains a significant fraction of the wintertime stationary wave variability in several regions. The principal centers of action reside within wave trains over the North Pacific\textendash North American region and the North Atlantic\textendash Eurdsian region where locally 30\%\textendash 40\% of the eddy height variability is explained by the zonal index. Only over the North Pacific does the stationary wave signal related to ENSO appreciably exceed that associated with the zonal index. The surface climate associated with the zonal index is described by a wavenumber 1 pattern, which has out-of-phase temperature anomalies between Eurasia and North America and amplitudes considerably larger than those experienced during ENSO. The analysis offers a physical basis for understanding extratropical seasonal climate anomalies as a simple linear combination of teleconnection patterns associated with \=u states and ENSO states. The utility of such an approach is illustrated for several cases of hitherto unexplained observed extreme climate anomalies during northern winter. It is also shown that a significant fraction of the interannual variability in some regions cannot he explained by either a zonal index or ENSO. A further important feature of the zonal index in the 1947\textendash 94 period is the recurrence of anomalies over multiyear periods. Such behavior has important implications for decadal climate variations, examples of which are given for secular changes after 1976.},

Here, the ability of this proxy, denoted CP, to represent the climatology and variability of CG lightning flash counts over the contiguous United States (CONUS) during the period 2003\textendash 2016 is assessed. CP values computed using the North American Regional Reanalysis are compared with negative and positive polarity CG flash counts from the National Lightning Detection Network. Overall, the proxy performs better on shorter time scales (daily and monthly) than on longer time scales (annual and semi-annual). Proxy performance tends to be worse during the warm season (May\textendash October), when most lightning occurs, and better during the cool season (November\textendash April). The correlation of annually accumulated CONUS CP with CG flash counts is not statistically significant because of poor warm-season performance. Cool season negative CG flash counts are well correlated with CONUS CP values. Positive CG flash counts ({$\sim$}7\% of all CG flashes) are well correlated with annual values of CONUS CP. The relatively strong relations between CP and CG flash counts in some regions and times of the year at daily resolution provide a benchmark for more complex proxies and suggest that proxy-based extended- and long-range prediction of lightning activity may be feasible to the extent that precipitation rate and CAPE can be predicted.},

They refer mainly to ice drift in the central Arctic during the period 2\textendash 21 August 2001. On board Oden a remote sensing array with a wind profiler, cloud radar and a scanning microwave radiometer, and a regular weather station operated continuously; soundings were also released during research stations. Turbulence and profile measurements on an 18-m mast were deployed on the ice, along with two sodar systems, a microbarograph array and a tethered sounding system. Surface flux and meteorological stations were also deployed on nearby ice floes. There is a clear diurnal cycle in radiation and also in wind speed, cloud base and visibility. It is absent in temperature and humidity, probably due to the very strong control by melting/ freezing ice and snow. In the advection of warm air, latent heat of melting maintains the surface temperature at 0~\textdegree C, while with a negative energy balance the latent heat of freezing of the salty ocean water acts to maintain the surface temperature {$>$} -2~\textdegree C. The constant presence of water at the surface maintains a relative humidity close to 100\%, and this is also often facilitated by an increasing specific humidity through the capping inversion, making entrainment a moisture source. This ensures cloudy conditions, with low cloud and fog prevailing most of the time. Intrusions of warm and moist air from beyond the ice edge are frequent, but the local Arctic boundary layer remains at a relatively constant temperature, and is shallow and well mixed with strong capping inversions. Power spectra of surface-layer wind speed sometimes show large variance at low frequency. A scanning radiometer provides a monitoring of the vertical thermal structure with a spatial and temporal resolution not seen before in the Arctic. There are often two inversions, an elevated main inversion and a weak surface inversion, and occasionally additional inversions occur. Enhanced entrainment across the main inversion appears to occur during frontal passages. Variance of the scanning radiometer temperatures occurs in large pulses rather than varying smoothly, and the height to the maximum variance appears to be a reasonable proxy for the boundary-layer depth.},

  abstract = {In situ atmospheric observations in the central Arctic are few and mostly from near the surface. A majority are from coastal regions whereas soundings over the Arctic Ocean are rare. This limits our understanding of the Arctic atmosphere, in particular aloft. It has been established that the vertical thermal structure is often stably stratified; this has been termed the `Arctic inversion'. It has also been established that near-surface warming in the Arctic has been larger than the global mean warming during the last several decades. To estimate climate trends in this data-sparse region, reanalysis data have often been used. In this paper we analyse the vertical thermal structure of the lower troposphere over the Arctic Ocean, using soundings from the SHEBA project. We find a strong annual cycle with strong surface inversions occurring only during autumn and winter, typically 500\textendash 800 metres deep and {$\sim$}10 \textdegree C strong. Summer is dominated by weaker elevated inversions at {$\sim$}100\textendash 400 m, a few hundred metres deep. Interestingly, this latter type of inversion also occurs frequently in winter, almost half the time. These soundings thus indicate that associating Arctic winter only with strong surface inversions is not entirely correct. We also compare these soundings to the ERA-40 reanalysis data. Systematic biases in ERA-40 in the SHEBA region include a near-surface warm bias, on average {$\sim$}0.5\textendash 1.0 \textdegree C, and a slight mid-troposphere cool bias. There is a significant difference in ERA-40 performance statistics for the SHEBA year comparing with years without soundings for the same region. The analysis increment\textemdash a measure of the impact of the observations in the assimilation process\textemdash confirms this. For example, the assimilation of the SHEBA soundings reduces the near-surface warm bias by about 50\%. However, the overall vertical structure and its annual variation are surprisingly insensitive to the assimilation of the soundings, and are in fact well represented by ERA-40. We speculate that the main improvement in assimilating the SHEBA soundings lies in an improvement in the timing of weather systems whereas their climatological vertical structure is less affected.

The results highlight the contrasting spatial structures and partially compensating effects of thermodynamic and dynamic coupling. In combination, thermodynamic and dynamic coupling produce a response pattern that is largely symmetric about the equator, whereas thermodynamic coupling alone yields an antisymmetric response. The latter is characterized by an interhemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, with maximum warming at high northern latitudes decreasing toward the equator, which displaces the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and Hadley circulation northward. In contrast, the fully coupled response shows enhanced warming at high latitudes of both hemispheres and along the equator; the equatorial warming is driven by anomalous ocean heat transport convergence and is accompanied by a narrow equatorward intensification of the northern and southern branches of the ITCZ. In both cases, the tropical precipitation response to Arctic sea ice loss feeds back onto the atmospheric circulation at midlatitudes via Rossby wave dynamics, highlighting the global interconnectivity of the coupled climate system. This study demonstrates the importance of ocean dynamics in mediating the equilibrium global climate response to Arctic sea ice loss.},

  abstract = {The impacts of the saturation adjustment type approach to sub-grid-scale (SGS) ice clouds in a turbulent closure scheme on the high clouds and their response to global warming were investigated based on the radiative\textendash convective equilibrium experiments (RCEs). This was motivated by the fact that the time scale of ice condensation is several orders of magnitude longer than that for liquid water. The RCEs were conducted with uniform sea surface temperatures over the spherical domain for the Earth's radius without rotation using an explicit cloud microphysics and a non-hydrostatic icosahedral atmospheric model. This study revealed that suppressing the phase change effect associated with the SGS ice condensation on the buoyancy of the SGS turbulence could cause approximately a 20 \% reduction of the total high cloud covers and a significantly different response of high cloud amounts to global warming due to the change in static stability near high clouds, which leads to weaker vertical heat transport at a sub-grid scale there. Since the typical value of the time scale of the ice-phase cloud is much longer than that for liquid water and the ice supersaturation is in general, using the saturation adjustment type approach for SGS ice clouds could lead to an overestimation of the effect of ice condensation for the turbulent mixing and model biases in simulations with both cloud resolving models and general circulation models. The present result underlines the critical nature of the treatment of SGS ice clouds in turbulence schemes which reflects a realistic ice condensation time scale not only for a better representation of high clouds in the current climate but for an improved projection of changes of high clouds due to global warming.},

  abstract = {A knowledge of radiative convective interactions is key to an understanding of the tropical climate. In an attempt to address this a cloud-resolving model has been run to a radiative-convective equilibrium state in three dimensions. The model includes a three-phase bulk microphysical scheme and a fully interactive two-stream broadband radiative-transfer scheme for both the infrared and solar radiation. The simulation is performed using a fixed sea surface temperature, and cyclic lateral boundary conditions. No `large-scale' convergence, mean wind shear or background vorticity was imposed. The total integration lasted 70 days, and a statistical equilibrium state was reached at all heights after 30 days of simulation in all model variables. It is seen that some variables, such as vertical mass flux, adjust quickly to their equilibrium values while others, such as column-integrated water amount, domain-mean temperature and convective available potential energy (CAPE) display variation on a longer 30-day time-scale. The equilibrium state had a column-integrated vapour amount of 42.3 kg m-2, a mean temperature of 258.7 K and a pseudo-adiabatic CAPE value of 1900 J kg-1. The equilibrium-state statistics are consistent with tropical observations. The convection does not remain randomly distributed but instead becomes organized, aligning in a band structure associated with high moisture values in the boundary layer. This organization seems to result from interactions between radiation, convection and surface fluxes. The surface-flux feedback is due to higher boundary-layer winds, associated with convection, increasing surface fluxes of moisture locally. Horizontally inhomogeneous radiation can act to make clouds longer lasting and also increase convergence into cloudy region. Replacing the wind-sensitive surface-flux calculation with a linear relaxation to surface values appeared to largely destroy this organization, as did the use of an imposed horizontally uniform radiative-heating rate.},

The focus is on the vertically integrated energy components, their monthly tendencies, transports, and divergences, using the most accurate computations in model and pressure coordinates. Approximate equations have often been used previously; although relatively small compared with the moist static energy, kinetic energy transports should be taken into account, as divergences can exceed several tens of watts per square meter. Changes in energy storage terms over a month are not negligible, as they are typically over 25 W m\textsuperscript{-2} in storm track regions. Transports of energy are meaningful only if the mass budget is closed.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Typical magnitudes of the divergence of sensible heat and potential energy are very large (several hundred watts per square meter), but partly cancel when combined as dry static energy, reflecting the role of isentropic flow. The latent energy and sensible heat contributions are strongly positively correlated because of the dominance of low-level flow, and the latent energy divergence also cancels a large component of the dry static energy divergence, leaving a modest residual. This arises from the dominance of moist adiabatic processes in the Tropics and subtropics as the net divergent transports depend on temperature departures in the vertical from the saturated adiabatic lapse rate and their covariability with wind. Careful numerical treatments are required or else small errors in the large terms that should cancel can be amplified. Common assumptions that diagnostics can be computed on model terrain-following coordinates, which therefore vary from day to day as the surface pressure changes, lead to errors in energy budgets of the order of 5 W m\textsuperscript{-2} owing to the covariability of energy terms with surface pressure.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}How well model coordinate results can be replicated in pressure coordinates has been explored along with the role of vertical resolution using a postprocessor developed at NCAR. The standard 17-level reanalysis pressure level archive does not adequately resolve the atmosphere, and we propose a new set of 30 pressure levels that has 25-mb vertical resolution below 700 mb and 50-mb vertical resolution in the rest of the troposphere. The diagnostics reveal major problems in the NCEP reanalyses in the stratosphere that are inherent in the model formulation, making them unsuitable for quantitative use for energetics in anything other than model coordinates. In addition, small flaws are found in the ECMWF postprocessing onto pressure levels. These stem from the way the vector fields are truncated, which is a necessary step to avoid aliasing before putting the values out on a 2.5\textdegree{} grid. Moreover, it is desirable to compute the gridpoint values exactly rather than interpolating them from the Gaussian grid, as currently done by ECMWF. The diagnostic results computed with 30 levels replicate the full model level vertically integrated energy divergences to within about 2 W m\textsuperscript{-2} over the ocean, while errors exceed 10 W m\textsuperscript{-2} in small spots over Greenland, Antarctica, and the Himalayan\textendash Tibetan Plateau complex.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {New estimates of the moistening of the atmosphere through evaporation at the surface and of the drying through precipitation are computed. Overall, the e-folding residence time of atmospheric moisture is just over 8 days. New estimates are also made of how much moisture that precipitates out comes from horizontal transport versus local evaporation, referred to as `recycling'. The results depend greatly on the scale of the domain under consideration and global maps of the recycling for annual means are produced for 500 km scales for which global recycling is 9.6\%, consisting of 8.9\% over land and 9.9\% over the oceans. Even for 1000 km scales, less than 20\% of the annual precipitation typically comes from evaporation within the domain. While average overall atmospheric moisture depletion and restoration must balance, precipitation falls only a small fraction of the time. Thus precipitation rates are also examined. Over the United States, one hour intervals with 0.1 mm or more are used to show that the frequency of precipitation ranges from over 30\% in the Northwest, to about 20\% in the Southeast and less than 4\% just east of the continental divide in winter, and from less than 2\% in California to over 20\% in the Southeast in summer. In midlatitudes precipitation typically falls about 10\% of the time, and so rainfall rates, conditional on when rain is falling, are much larger than evaporation rates. The mismatches in the rates of rainfall versus evaporation imply that precipitating systems of all kinds feed mostly on the moisture already in the atmosphere. Over North America, much of the precipitation originates from moisture advected from the Gulf of Mexico and subtropical Atlantic or Pacific a day or so earlier. Increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere produce global warming through an increase in downwelling infrared radiation, and thus not only increase surface temperatures but also enhance the hydrological cycle, as much of the heating at the surface goes into evaporating surface moisture. Global temperature increases signify that the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere increases and, together with enhanced evaporation, this means that the actual atmospheric moisture should increase. It follows that naturally-occurring droughts are likely to be exacerbated by enhanced potential evapotranspiration. Further, globally there must be an increase in precipitation to balance the enhanced evaporation but the processes by which precipitation is altered locally are not well understood. Observations confirm that atmospheric moisture is increasing in many places, for example at a rate of about 5\% per decade over the United States. Based on the above results, we argue that increased moisture content of the atmosphere therefore favors stronger rainfall or snowfall events, thus increasing risk of flooding, which is a pattern observed to be happening in many parts of the world. Moreover, because there is a disparity between the rates of increase of atmospheric moisture and precipitation, there are implied changes in the frequency of precipitation and/or efficiency of precipitation (related to how much moisture is left behind in a storm). However, an analysis of linear trends in the frequency of precipitation events for the United States corresponding to thresholds of 0.1 and 1 mm/h shows that the most notable statistically significant trends are for increases in the southern United States in winter and decreases in the Pacific Northwest from November through January, which may be related to changes in atmospheric circulation and storm tracks associated with El Ni\~no\textendash Southern Oscillation trends. It is suggested that as the physical constraints on precipitation apply only globally, more attention should be paid to rates in both observations and models as well as the frequency of occurrence.},

The data used come from the WMO archive of 7-level, twice daily initialized analyses and from the WCRP archive of 14-level, four-times daily uninitialized analyses. The first perspective, which considers the equation of continuity in pressure coordinates locally in three dimensions, reveals spurious residuals in the equation of up to 100\% of the size of the divergence term, with largest errors of 60\% to 100\% in the tropics. In this case the horizontal velocity and vertical {$<$}em{$>$}p{$<$}/em{$>$}-velodty ({$\omega$}) fields are checked for consistency. Modest improvements occur when 14 versus 7 levels are used. The second perspective considers the vertical integral in which the surface pressure tendency should balance the total mass convergence into a column, and thus does not involve the omega fields. The latter reveals that the dominant residual is due to the failure to resolve the semidiurnal tide with only twice-daily data, so that a large-scale wavenumber 2 pattern with maxima in the tropics results as a residual. However, there are also many smaller scale and smaller amplitude features in the residual that cannot be explained simply. The residuals from the uninitialized analyses are much larger so that while four-times daily data removes much of the wavenumber 2 semidiurnal tide structure, the total residuals are just as large as with the twice-daily initialized data. Improvements in using 14 levels versus 7 are marginal for the vertical integral. The moisture budget, which is an important part of the overall mass budget, produces plausible estimates of vertically integrated evaporation minus precipitation, but needs to be validated.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The primary source of the mass imbalance arises from the methods of postprocessing the variables onto pressure surfaces. Because sophisticated four-dimensional data assimilation now performs analyses of fields on model (sigma) surfaces, the postprocessing performs interpolations (using splines under tension) from model coordinates to pressure coordinates, with the result that the archived variables are really representative of individual levels rather than finite-sized layers. The implications are that residuals computed in other budgets, such as diabatic heating from the thermodynamic equation, will also include large errors, most of which will, however, be systematic.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The effects of several common approximations in the treatment of the lower boundary on mass conservation are examined, and proper accounting for the full variations in both space and time of surface pressure on vertical mass integrals lead to the computation of kinematic orographic forcing from the analyses as a residual. The diagnosed lower boundary-induced vertical motions are weak and do not reveal the strong dipole patterns normally expected, which may indicate that the planetary waves are not adequately forced in the forecast model used in the four-dimensional data assimilation.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The latter includes the long-term mean and interannual variability from 1979 to 2001 and, in the Tropics, corresponds to the large-scale overturning global monsoon and the embedded Hadley and Walker circulations. In the extratropics, it includes the quasi-stationary planetary waves, which are primarily a factor in the Northern Hemisphere winter. In addition to the mean annual cycle, results are presented for the interannual variability. In the extratropics, poleward transports of both latent and dry static energy reinforce one another. However, the results highlight strong cancellations between the transports of latent and dry static energy in the Tropics as moisture is converted into latent heat, and also between quasi-stationary and transient components in the extratropics. Hence the total energy transports and divergences are fairly seamless with latitude and the total interannual variability is substantially less than that of the components. The strong interplay between the transient and quasi-stationary waves in the atmosphere highlights the symbiotic relationship between them, as the stationary waves determine the location and intensity of the storm tracks while the transient disturbances help maintain the stationary waves. These results highlight that observationally there is a very strong constraint that the global energy budget places on atmospheric dynamics.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The effective heat sources and sinks (diabatic heating) and effective moisture sources and sinks for the atmosphere are computed and combined to produce overall estimates of the atmospheric energy divergence and the net flux through the Earth's surface. On an annual mean basis, this is directly related to the divergence of the ocean heat transport, and new computations of the ocean heat transport are made for the ocean basins. Results are presented for January and July, and the annual mean for 1988, along with a comprehensive discussion of errors. While the current results are believed to be the best available at present, there are substantial shortcomings remaining in the estimates of the atmospheric heat and moisture budgets. The issues, which are also present in all previous studies, arise from the diurnal cycle, problems with atmospheric divergence, vertical resolution, spurious mass imbalances, initialized versus uninitialized atmospheric analyses, and postprocessing to produce the atmospheric archive on pressure surfaces. Over land, additional problems arise from the complex surface topography, so that computed surface fluxes are more reliable over the oceans. The use of zonal means to compute ocean transports is shown to produce misleading results because a considerable part of the implied ocean transports is through the land. The need to compute the heat budget locally is demonstrated and results indicate lower ocean transports than in previous residual calculations which are therefore more compatible with direct ocean estimates. A Poisson equation is solved with appropriate boundary conditions of zero normal heat flux through the continental boundaries to obtain the ocean heat transport. Because of the poor observational data base, adjustments to the surface fluxes are necessary over the southern oceans. Error bars are estimated based on the large-scale spurious residuals over land of 30 W m-2 over 1000 km scales (1012 m2). In the Atlantic Ocean, a northward transport emerges at all latitudes with peak values of 1.1{$\pm$}0.2 PW (1 standard error) at 20 to 30\textdegree N. Comparable values are achieved in the Pacific at 20\textdegree N, so that the total is 2.1{$\pm$}0.3 PW. The peak southward transport is at 15 to 20\textdegree S of 1.9{$\pm$}0.3 PW made up of strong components from both the Pacific and Indian Oceans and with a heat flux from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean in the Indonesian throughflow. The pattern of poleward heat fluxes is suggestive of a strong role for Ekman transports in the tropical regions.},

The analysis focuses on the mean annual cycle of the divergent winds and associated vertical motions, as given by the monthly mean fields for 1979\textendash 93 reanalyses from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction\textendash National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP\textendash NCAR) and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which are able to reproduce the dominant modes. A complex empirical orthogonal function analysis of the divergent circulation brings out two dominant modes with essentially the same vertical structures in all months of the year. The first mode, which depicts the global monsoon, has a simple vertical structure with a maximum in vertical motion at about 400 mb, divergence in the upper troposphere that is strongest at 150 mb and decays to zero amplitude above 70 mb, and convergence in the lower troposphere with a maximum at 925 mb (ECMWF) or 850 mb (NCEP). However, this mode has a rich three-dimensional spatial structure that evolves with the seasons. It accounts for 60\% of the annual cycle variance of the divergent mass circulation and dominates the Hadley circulation as well as three overturning transverse cells. These include the Pacific Walker circulation; an Americas\textendash Atlantic Walker circulation, both of which comprise rising motion in the west and sinking in the east; and a transverse cell over Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and the Indian Ocean that has rising motion in the east and sinking toward the west. These exist year-round but migrate and evolve considerably with the seasons and have about a third to half of the mass flux of the peak Hadley cell. The annual cycle of the two Hadley cells reveals peak strength in early February and early August in both reanalyses.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}A second monsoon mode, which accounts for 20\% of the variance, features relatively shallow but vigorous overturning with the maximum vertical velocities near 800 mb, outflow from 750 to 350 mb, and inflow peaking at 925 mb. It is especially strong over Africa where the shallow, mostly meridional overturning migrates back and forth across the equator with the seasons. It influences the Middle East, has a signature over Australia, and is also an important component of the overturning in the tropical eastern Pacific and Atlantic, and thus of the convergence zones in these regions.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The relationship of the global monsoon to the regional monsoons is described over six zonal sectors: Africa, Australia\textendash Asia, North America, South America, and the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Only the two ocean areas do not undergo a seasonal reversal required for monsoons, although they have direct overturning cells and they nevertheless participate in the global monsoon through the changes in large-scale overturning. The regional meridional cross sections highlight the importance of the shallow overturning cell in lower-troposphere monsoon activity. The steadiness of the overturning circulation is determined by comparing the signal of the seasonal mean vertical motions at 500 mb with the standard deviation of the transient daily variations. Locations where this signal exceeds 60\% of the daily noise correspond closely with the regional centers of the monsoon.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The focus is on TOA radiation from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) (February 1985\textendash April 1989) and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) (March 2000\textendash May 2004) satellite observations combined with results from two atmospheric reanalyses and three ocean datasets that enable a comprehensive estimate of uncertainties. Surface energy flux departures from the annual mean and the implied annual cycle in ``equivalent ocean energy content'' are compared with the directly observed ocean energy content (OE) and tendency ({$\delta$}OE/{$\delta$}t) to reveal the inferred annual cycle of divergence ({$\nabla$} {$\cdot$} FO). In the extratropics, the surface flux dominates the ocean energy tendency, although it is supplemented by ocean Ekman transports that enhance the annual cycle in ocean heat content. In contrast, in the tropics, ocean dynamics dominate OE variations throughout the year in association with the annual cycle in surface wind stress and the North Equatorial Current. An analysis of the regional characteristics of the first joint empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of FS, {$\delta$}OE/{$\delta$}t, and {$\nabla$} {$\cdot$} FO is presented, and the largest sources of uncertainty are attributed to variations in OE. The mean and annual cycle of zonal mean global ocean meridional heat transports are estimated. The annual cycle reveals the strongest poleward heat transports in each hemisphere in the cold season, from November to April in the north and from May to October in the south, with a substantial across-equatorial transport, exceeding 4 PW in some months. Annual mean results do not differ greatly from some earlier estimates, but the sources of uncertainty are exposed. Comparison of annual means with direct ocean observations gives reasonable agreement, except in the North Atlantic, where transports from the ocean transects are slightly greater than the estimates presented here.},

This paper reviews the third approach using indirect methods and outlines the advantages associated with the use of global atmospheric analyses from four-dimensional data assimilation (4DDA). The time mean increment required in producing analyses in 4DDA is identical to the systematic short-term (6 h) assimilating model forecast error and is most likely due to errors in the model physics. Therefore, the analyses include a desirable fix, which allows the sum of the ``physics'' to be deduced from ``dynamics.'' The focus is on the heat and moisture budgets to infer surface heat fluxes and freshwater fluxes, but with the recognition of the need to balance the mass budget as well. The diurnal cycle of the vertically integrated mass budget for July 1985 and January 1996 from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (formerly the National Meteorological Center) reanalyses is presented, revealing the strong semidiurnal tide and highlighting the need for at least four-times-daily data. The new results reveal that gross violations of the mass budget continue to be present, but these can be allowed for.

(2020) Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, 125, e2020JD033214. Using dew-point depression as a proxy for cloud, however, we found a significant reduction in the number of inferred cloud layers, which is inherited from a bias in the specific humidity in the ERA5 reanalysis, most notably over the high latitudes of the SO, where a multilayer cloud structure is frequently observed. The reanalysis was also found to have thinner inferred cloud geometric layer and shallower cloud top heights. Further analysis showed that the reanalysis displays a greater percentage of soundings having no inversion with this bias being more pronounced at high latitudes that tends to be associated with the colder sea surface temperature. While the statistics of the main inversion height are largely consistent, the average inversion strength in the ERA5 reanalysis is found to be weaker than the observations. We anticipate the 137-level ERA5 reanalysis simulation yields a smoothed vertical structure, from which the 37 standard levels ERA5 reanalysis is linearly interpolated. An examination of the sensitivity of the radiative transfer to cloud macrophysics suggests that the correct representation of thin multiple cloud layers can help reduce the amount of downward shortwave surface radiation over the SO.},

  abstract = {Abstract The quasigeostrophic equations consist of the advection of linearized potential vorticity coupled with advection of temperature at the bounding upper and lower surfaces. Numerical models of quasigeostrophic flow often employ greater (scaled) resolution in the horizontal than in the vertical (the two-layer model is an extreme example). In the interior, this has the effect of suppressing interactions between layers at horizontal scales that are small compared to N{$\delta$}z/f (where {$\delta$}z is the vertical resolution, N the buoyancy frequency, and f the Coriolis parameter). The nature of the turbulent cascade in the interior is, however, not fundamentally altered because the downscale cascade of potential enstrophy in quasigeostrophic turbulence and the downscale cascade of enstrophy in two-dimensional turbulence (occurring layerwise) both yield energy spectra with slopes of -3. It is shown here that a similar restriction on the vertical resolution applies to the representation of horizontal motions at the surfaces, but the penalty for underresolving in the vertical is complete suppression of the surface temperature cascade at small scales and a corresponding artificial steepening of the surface energy spectrum. This effect is demonstrated in the nonlinear Eady model, using a finite-difference representation in comparison with a model that explicitly advects temperature at the upper and lower surfaces. Theoretical predictions for the spectrum of turbulence in the nonlinear Eady model are reviewed and compared to the simulated flows, showing that the latter model yields an accurate representation of the cascade dynamics. To accurately represent dynamics at horizontal wavenumber K in the vertically finite-differenced model, it is found that the vertical grid spacing must satisfy {$\delta$}z {$\lessequivlnt$} 0.3f/(NK); at wavenumbers K {$>$} 0.3f/(N{$\delta$}z), the spectrum of temperature variance rolls off rapidly.},

  abstract = {Abstract The horizontal wavenumber spectra of wind and temperature near the tropopause have a steep -3 slope at synoptic scales and a shallower -5/3 slope at mesoscales, with a transition between the two regimes at a wavelength of about 450 km. Here it is demonstrated that a quasigeostrophic model driven by baroclinic instability exhibits such a transition near its upper boundary (analogous to the tropopause) when surface temperature advection at that boundary is properly resolved and forced. To accurately represent surface advection at the upper and lower boundaries, the vertical structure of the model streamfunction is decomposed into four parts, representing the interior flow with the first two neutral modes, and each surface with its Green's function solution, resulting in a system with four prognostic equations. Mean temperature gradients are applied at each surface, and a mean potential vorticity gradient consisting both of {$\beta$} and vertical shear is applied in the interior. The system exhibits three fundamental types of baroclinic instability: interactions between the upper and lower surfaces (Eady type), interactions between one surface and the interior (Charney type), and interactions between the barotropic and baroclinic interior modes (Phillips type). The turbulent steady states that result from each of these instabilities are distinct, and those of the former two types yield shallow kinetic energy spectra at small scales along those boundaries where mean temperature gradients are present. When both mean interior and surface gradients are present, the surface spectrum reflects a superposition of the interior-dominated -3 slope cascade at large scales, and the surface-dominated -5/3 slope cascade at small scales. The transition wavenumber depends linearly on the ratio of the interior potential vorticity gradient to the surface temperature gradient, and scales with the inverse of the deformation scale when {$\beta$} = 0.},

  abstract = {Abstract An observational, modeling, and theoretical study of the scales, growth rates, and spectral fluxes of baroclinic instability in the ocean is presented, permitting a discussion of the relation between the local instability scale; the first baroclinic deformation scale Rdef; and the equilibrated, observed eddy scale. The geography of the large-scale, meridional quasigeostrophic potential vorticity (QGPV) gradient is mapped out using a climatological atlas, and attention is drawn to asymmetries between midlatitude eastward currents and subtropical return flows, the latter of which has westward and eastward zonal velocity shears. A linear stability analysis of the climatology, under the ``local approximation,'' yields the growth rates and scales of the fastest-growing modes. Fastest-growing modes on eastward-flowing currents, such as the Kuroshio and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, have a scale somewhat larger (by a factor of about 2) than Rdef. They are rapidly growing (e folding in 1\textendash 3 weeks) and deep reaching, and they can be characterized by an interaction between interior QGPV gradients, with a zero crossing in the QGPV gradient at depth. In contrast, fastest-growing modes in the subtropical return flows (as well as much of the gyre interiors) have a scale smaller than Rdef (by a factor of between 0.5 and 1), grow more slowly (e-folding scale of several weeks), and owe their existence to the interaction of a positive surface QGPV gradient and a negative gradient beneath. These predictions of linear theory under the local approximation are then compared to observed eddy length scales and spectral fluxes using altimetric data. It is found that the scale of observed eddies is some 2\textendash 3 times larger than the instability scale, indicative of a modest growth in horizontal scale. No evidence of an inverse cascade over decades in scale is found. Outside of a tropical band, the eddy scale varies with latitude along with but somewhat less strongly than Rdef. Finally, exactly the same series of calculations is carried out on fields from an idealized global eddying model, enabling study in a more controlled setting. Broadly similar conclusions are reached, thus reinforcing inferences made from the data.},

  abstract = {Abstract A theory is presented that attempts to explain the tropospheric blocking phenomenon caused by the resonant amplification of large-scale planetary waves forced by topography and surface heating. It is shown that a wave becomes resonant with the stationary forcings when the wind condition in the lower atmosphere is such that the phase speed of the wave is reduced to zero. The resonant behavior of the wave in the presence of Ekman pumping and other damping mechanisms is used to account for the time amplification of the pressure ridges that is an essential part of the blocking phenomenon. This same time behavior also allows the waves to interact with the mean flow in the stratosphere, possibly initiating major sudden warmings. Such a situation was, in fact, assumed by Matsuno (1971) in the lower boundary of his stratospheric model of sudden warming. The basis for reviving the classical normal-mode theory (when faced with the difficulties associated with the zero-wind line) is presented in Part II. The present Part I serves as an introduction to the three-part series and discusses, with the aid of a simple mathematical model, the relevant physical mechanisms involved. Though the theory of resonant Rossby waves is a classical one, the contribution of the present papers is in pointing out that the theory offers, despite the difficulties and controversies associated with it, a viable mechanism that may be the cause of some prominent physical phenomena in the atmosphere.},

However, it is still unknown whether water has ever condensed on the surface of Venus3,4 because the planet\textemdash now completely dry5\textemdash has undergone global resurfacing events that obscure most of its history6,7. The conditions required for water to have initially condensed on the surface of Solar System terrestrial planets are highly uncertain, as they have so far only been studied with one-dimensional numerical climate models3 that cannot account for the effects of atmospheric circulation and clouds, which are key climate stabilizers. Here we show using three-dimensional global climate model simulations of early Venus and Earth that water clouds\textemdash which preferentially form on the nightside, owing to the strong subsolar water vapour absorption\textemdash have a strong net warming effect that inhibits surface water condensation even at modest insolations (down to 325\,watts per square metre, that is, 0.95 times the Earth solar constant). This shows that water never condensed and that, consequently, oceans never formed on the surface of Venus. Furthermore, this shows that the formation of Earth's oceans required much lower insolation than today, which was made possible by the faint young Sun. This also implies the existence of another stability state for present-day Earth: the `steam Earth', with all the water from the oceans evaporated into the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract The geostrophic adjustment process in a propagating jet maximum is studied through numerical experiments performed with a two-layer, nonlinear primitive equation model. Gravity-inertia modes generated by the jet streak from an initial three-dimensional balanced flow are isolated with the aid of diagnostic quasi-geostrophic and balance models. Them modes appear to represent gravitational subsynoptic ``signal'' rather than ``noise,'' and their behavior is examined as a function of initial core strength. Persistent unbalanced patterns relative to the jet core are discovered, whose amplitude increases approximately as the square of the Rossby number. Their behavior is suggestive of forced, rather than free, ageostrophic modes, and their existence implies that the ``four-cell'' vertical motion pattern characteristic of jet streaks in filtered models may be significantly altered in a real jet streak. The free response to initial data imbalances placed at varying locations in a jet streak environment is explored; localized perturbations in the nondivergent wind, geopotential and irrotational wind are individually inserted into a strong jet, and difference maps are then constructed with the aid of a control experiment. For the nondivergent wind anomaly, and to a lesser extent for the geopotential anomaly, results generally agree qualitatively with classical adjustment theory, once the effect of background vorticity on the deformation radius is considered. Departures from theory arise due to other nonlinearity, and the time-dependent nature of the mean flow. In the case of the irrotational wind anomaly, only gravitational modes am generated, as expected; their time evolution is influenced by the ambient vorticity, which alters the effective Coriolis frequency.},

The general characterization of blocking regions is in agreement with most other studies, though more detail is provided here. In the annual average, blocking is most prevalent in the large region from the eastern Atlantic Ocean through Europe to central Asia with a secondary region in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. Using a blocking criterion with the requirement for both longitudinal extent and temporal persistence, the peak in the frequency is in the Scandinavian region, where 24\% of the days are characterized by blocking. In the east Pacific maximum, the corresponding number is 7\%. However, there is considerable and very important interannual variability. The decay rate in the number of blocking events lasting at least a specified number of days is significantly less over Europe than elsewhere. However, the average intensity of blocking episodes is slightly higher in the east Pacific. The mean annual cycle of blocking is quite complex. Over most of Europe it continues through the year, with maximum intensities in the autumn and winter. To both the east and west, over the western Atlantic and Asia, there are two periods in the year of highest blocking frequency. Similar two-cycle behavior is found in the eastern Pacific region. The relationship of blocking with the storm track and the mean planetary-scale geopotential ridges is considered, and the evidence that blocking is a particular phenomenon with its own nonlinear dynamics is discussed.},

The east Pacific temperature influences weather and climate worldwide, and the Pliocene climate may be an instructive analogue to a future warm climate arising from anthropogenic elevation of CO2, making understanding the Pliocene equatorial SST gradient especially relevant. A mechanism for maintaining a weaker Pliocene equatorial temperature gradient is proposed that borrows from theories of atmospheric superrotation. The mechanism is based on enhanced or rearranged tropical convective activity during the warmer Pliocene climate exciting atmospheric Rossby waves that propagated poleward from the equator. These waves produced an equatorward flux of westerly momentum that weakened the surface easterlies and therefore the east-west thermocline slope and SST gradient.},

The transverse circulations are identified for eight cases that span the period from 1960 to 1987 utilizing an isentropic analysis of the operational radiosonde data. The analyses depict the interaction of 1) a direct circulation located within the confluent entrance region of an upper-level jet streak over the northeastern United States or southeastern Canada with 2) an indirect circulation in the diffluent exit region of a jet streak associated with a trough nearing the East Coast. This interaction contributes to differential moisture and temperature advections and vertical motions necessary to produce heavy snowfall along the coast. It is suggested that the circulation patterns associated with the jet streak establish an environment within which boundary layer processes (e.g., cold-air damming, coastal frontogenesis, the development of a low-level jet Streak) can further contribute to cyclogenesis and the development of severe winter weather conditions.},

More recently, a new exponent called the cancellation exponent has been introduced for characterizing rapidly oscillating quantities. Not all of these exponents are independent; some of them are simply related to more familiar scaling for velocity and temperature structure functions either exactly or through plausible hypotheses familiar for turbulence. A primary purpose of this paper is to establish the interrelationships among the various exponents. In doing so, we obtain several additional relations. Much of the paper is relevant to general stochastic processes, although the discussion is heavily influenced by the turbulent context. We first examine the case of one-dimensional random processes and subsequently consider two- and three-dimensional processes. Special consideration is given to characteristic values appropriate to the geometry of turbulence, as well as the lifetimes of eddies of various scales. Finally, we discuss some properties of the tails of the probability density function to which the scaling properties of high-order structure functions are related and discuss the implications of multifractality on their structure.},

  abstract = {We describe and illustrate a mechanism whereby convective aggregation and eastward propagating equatorial disturbances, which are similar in some respects to the Madden\textendash Julian Oscillation (MJO), arise. We construct a simple explicit system consisting only of the shallow-water equations plus a humidity variable; moisture enters via evaporation from a wet surface, is transported by the flow and removed by condensation, thus producing an anomaly in the height field. For a broad range of parameters the system is excitable even when linearly stable, with condensation producing convergence and gravity waves that, acting together, trigger more condensation. On the equatorial {$\beta$}-plane the convection first aggregates near the Equator, generating patterns related to those encountered in the Matsuno\textendash Gill problem. However, the pattern is unstable and more convection is triggered on its eastern edge, leading to a self-sustaining precipitating disturbance that progresses eastward. The propagation is eastward because the warm, moist converging air from the east induced by the Matsuno\textendash Gill pattern is more convectively unstable than the converging air from the west. The pattern is confined to a region within a few deformation radii of the Equator, as here the convection can create the convergence needed to organize itself into a self-sustaining pattern; thus, smaller values of the beta parameter give rise to a wider disturbance. Formation of the disturbance preferentially occurs where the surface is warmer, and sufficient time (typically a few tens of days) must pass before conditions arise that enable the disturbance to reform, a well-known characteristic of the MJO. The speed of the disturbance depends on the efficiency of evaporation and the heat released by condensation, and is typically a few metres per second, much less than the Kelvin wave speed.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the possible response of the large-scale atmospheric structure to a warmer climate. Using integrations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in conjunction with physical arguments, we try to identify what changes are likely to be robust and what the underlying mechanisms might be. We focus on the large-scale zonally averaged circulation, in particular on height of the tropopause, the strength and position of the surface westerlies and the strength and extent of the Hadley Cell. We present analytic arguments and numerical calculations which suggest that under global warming the height of the tropopause will increase in both the transient response and final equilibrium state, and an increase is clearly found in all the comprehensive models in CMIP5. Upper stratospheric cooling is also found in the comprehensive models, and this too can be explained by a radiative argument. Regarding the circulation, most models show a slight expansion and weakening of the Hadley Cell, depending on season and hemisphere. The expansion is small and largely confined to winter but with some expansion in Southern Hemisphere summer. The weakening occurs principally in the Northern Hemisphere but the intermodel scatter is large. There is also a general polewards shift in surface westerlies, but the changes are small and again are little larger than the intermodel variability in the change. This shift is positively correlated with the Hadley Cell expansion to a degree that depends somewhat on the metric chosen for the latter. There is a robust strengthening in the Southern Hemisphere surface winds across seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a slight strengthening in the westerlies in most models in winter but a consistent weakening of the westerlies in summer. We present various physical arguments concerning these circulation changes but none that are both demonstrably correct and that account for the model results. We conclude that the above-mentioned large-scale thermodynamic/radiative changes in the large-scale atmospheric structure are generally robust, in the sense of being both well understood and consistently reproduced by comprehensive models. In that sense the dynamical changes are less robust given the current state of knowledge and simulation, although one cannot conclude that they are, in principle, unknowable or less predictable.},

  abstract = {This paper examines probability distributions of local wave activity (LWA), a measure of the jet stream's meander, and factors that control them. The observed column-mean LWA distributions exhibit significant seasonal, interhemispheric, and regional variations but are always positively skewed in the extratropics, and their tail often involves disruptions of the jet stream. A previously derived one-dimensional (1D) traffic flow model driven by observed spectra of transient eddy forcing qualitatively reproduces the shape of the observed LWA distribution. It is shown that the skewed distribution emerges from nonlinearity in the zonal advection of LWA even though the eddy forcing is symmetrically distributed. A slower jet and stronger transient and stationary eddy forcings, when introduced independently, all broaden the LWA distribution and increase the probability of spontaneous jet disruption. A quasigeostrophic two-layer model also simulates skewed LWA distributions in the upper layer. However, in the two-layer model both transient eddy forcing and the jet speed increase with an increasing shear (meridional temperature gradient), and their opposing influence leaves the frequency of jet disruptions insensitive to the vertical shear. When the model's nonlinearity in the zonal flux of potential vorticity is artificially suppressed, it hinders wave-flow interaction and virtually eliminates reversal of the upper-layer zonal wind. The study underscores the importance of nonlinearity in the zonal transmission of Rossby waves to the frequency of jet disruptions and associated weather anomalies.},

Notably, snow and soil moisture affect surface radiation and flux partitioning properties, moisture storage and land surface memory.

Our knowledge of historic fire emissions has progressively improved over the past decades due mostly to the development of new proxies and the improvement of fire models. Currently, there is a suite of proxies including sedimentary charcoal records, measurements of fire-emitted trace gases and black carbon stored in ice and firn, and visibility observations. These proxies provide opportunities to extrapolate emission estimates back in time based on satellite data starting in 1997, but each proxy has strengths and weaknesses regarding, for example, the spatial and temporal extents over which they are representative. We developed a new historic biomass burning emissions dataset starting in 1750 that merges the satellite record with several existing proxies and uses the average of six models from the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP) protocol to estimate emissions when the available proxies had limited coverage. According to our approach, global biomass burning emissions were relatively constant, with 10-year averages varying between 1.8 and 2.3 Pg C yr\textsuperscript{-1}. Carbon emissions increased only slightly over the full time period and peaked during the 1990s after which they decreased gradually. There is substantial uncertainty in these estimates, and patterns varied depending on choices regarding data representation, especially on regional scales. The observed pattern in fire carbon emissions is for a large part driven by African fires, which accounted for 58 \% of global fire carbon emissions. African fire emissions declined since about 1950 due to conversion of savanna to cropland, and this decrease is partially compensated for by increasing emissions in deforestation zones of South America and Asia. These global fire emission estimates are mostly suited for global analyses and will be used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The investigation is based on the late twenty-first century over greater North America (20\textdegree\textendash 90\textdegree N, 50\textdegree\textendash 160\textdegree W) using 40 simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, spanning 1920\textendash 2100. AA is found to promote regionally varying ridging aloft (500 hPa) with strong seasonal differences reflecting the location of the strongest surface thermal forcing. During winter, maximum increases in future geopotential heights are centered over the Arctic Ocean, in conjunction with sea ice loss, but minimum height increases (troughing) occur to the south, over the continental United States. During summer the location of maximum height inflation shifts equatorward, forming an annular band across mid-to-high latitudes of the entire Northern Hemisphere. This band spans the continents, whose enhanced surface heating is aided by antecedent snow-cover loss and reduced terrestrial heat capacity. Through the thermal wind relationship, midtropospheric winds weaken on the equatorward flank of both seasonal ridging anomalies\textemdash mainly over Canada during winter and even more over the continental United States during summer\textemdash but strengthen elsewhere to form a dipole anomaly pattern in each season. Changes in circulation waviness, expressed as sinuosity, are inversely correlated with changes in zonal wind speed at nearly all latitudes, both in the projections and as observed during recent decades. Over the central United States during summer, the weaker and wavier flow promotes drying and enhanced heating, thus favoring more intense summer weather.},

  abstract = {Abstract The authors summarize the twenty-first-century Arctic climate simulated by NCAR's Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). Under a strong radiative forcing scenario, the model simulates a much warmer, wetter, cloudier, and stormier Arctic climate with considerably less sea ice and a fresher Arctic Ocean. The high correlation among the variables composing these changes\textemdash temperature, precipitation, cloudiness, sea level pressure (SLP), and ice concentration\textemdash suggests that their close coupling collectively represents a fingerprint of Arctic climate change. Although the projected changes in CCSM4 are generally consistent with those in other GCMs, several noteworthy features are identified. Despite more global warming in CCSM4, Arctic changes are generally less than under comparable greenhouse forcing in CCSM3, as represented by Arctic amplification (16\% weaker) and the date of a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean (20 years later). Autumn is the season of the most pronounced Arctic climate change among all the primary variables. The changes are very similar across the five ensemble members, although SLP displays the largest internal variability. The SLP response exhibits a significant trend toward stronger extreme Arctic cyclones, implying greater wave activity that would promote coastal erosion. Based on a commonly used definition of the Arctic (the area encompassing the 10\textdegree C July air temperature isotherm), the region shrinks by about 40\% during the twenty-first century, in conjunction with a nearly 10-K warming trend poleward of 70\textdegree N. Despite this pronounced long-term warming, CCSM4 simulates a hiatus in the secular Arctic climate trends during a decade-long stretch in the 2040s and to a lesser extent in the 2090s. These pauses occur despite averaging over five ensemble members and are remarkable because they happen under the most extreme greenhouse-forcing scenario and in the most climatically sensitive region of the world.},

In particular, the authors investigate the hypothesis that the primary source of mesoscale eddies is baroclinic instability acting locally on the mean state. Using local mean vertical profiles of shear and stratification from an eddying primitive equation simulation, the forced\textendash dissipated quasigeostrophic equations are integrated in a doubly periodic domain at various locations. The scales, energy levels, and structure of the eddies found in the MESO simulation are compared to those predicted by linear stability analysis, as well as to the eddying structure of the quasigeostrophic simulations. This allows the authors to quantitatively estimate the role of local nonlinear effects and cascade phenomena in the generation of the eddy field. There is a modest transfer of energy (an ``inverse cascade'') to larger scales in the horizontal, with the length scale of the resulting eddies typically comparable to or somewhat larger than the wavelength of the most unstable mode. The eddies are, however, manifestly nonlinear, and in many locations the turbulence is fairly well developed. Coherent structures also ubiquitously emerge during the nonlinear evolution of the eddy field. There is a near-universal tendency toward the production of grave vertical scales, with the barotropic and first baroclinic modes dominating almost everywhere, but there is a degree of surface intensification that is not captured by these modes. Although the results from the local quasigeostrophic model compare well with those of the primitive equation model in many locations, some profiles do not equilibrate in the quasigeostrophic model. In many cases, bottom friction plays an important quantitative role in determining the final scale and magnitude of eddies in the quasigeostrophic simulations.},

  abstract = {This study diagnoses the climate sensitivity, radiative forcing and climate feedback estimates from eleven general circulation models participating in the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and analyzes inter-model differences. This is done by taking into account the fact that the climate response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2) is not necessarily only mediated by surface temperature changes, but can also result from fast land warming and tropospheric adjustments to the CO2 radiative forcing. By considering tropospheric adjustments to CO2 as part of the forcing rather than as feedbacks, and by using the radiative kernels approach, we decompose climate sensitivity estimates in terms of feedbacks and adjustments associated with water vapor, temperature lapse rate, surface albedo and clouds. Cloud adjustment to CO2 is, with one exception, generally positive, and is associated with a reduced strength of the cloud feedback; the multi-model mean cloud feedback is about 33~\% weaker. Non-cloud adjustments associated with temperature, water vapor and albedo seem, however, to be better understood as responses to land surface warming. Separating out the tropospheric adjustments does not significantly affect the spread in climate sensitivity estimates, which primarily results from differing climate feedbacks. About 70~\% of the spread stems from the cloud feedback, which remains the major source of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity, with a large contribution from the tropics. Differences in tropical cloud feedbacks between low-sensitivity and high-sensitivity models occur over a large range of dynamical regimes, but primarily arise from the regimes associated with a predominance of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus clouds. The combined water vapor plus lapse rate feedback also contributes to the spread of climate sensitivity estimates, with inter-model differences arising primarily from the relative humidity responses throughout the troposphere. Finally, this study points to a substantial role of nonlinearities in the calculation of adjustments and feedbacks for the interpretation of inter-model spread in climate sensitivity estimates. We show that in climate model simulations with large forcing (e.g., 4~\texttimes{} CO2), nonlinearities cannot be assumed minor nor neglected. Having said that, most results presented here are consistent with a number of previous feedback studies, despite the very different nature of the methodologies and all the uncertainties associated with them.},

  abstract = {Shallow cumulus clouds in the trade-wind regions are at the heart of the long standing uncertainty in climate sensitivity estimates. In current climate models, cloud feedbacks are strongly influenced by cloud-base cloud amount in the trades. Therefore, understanding the key factors controlling cloudiness near cloud-base in shallow convective regimes has emerged as an important topic of investigation. We review physical understanding of these key controlling factors and discuss the value of the different approaches that have been developed so far, based on global and high-resolution model experimentations and process-oriented analyses across a range of models and for observations. The trade-wind cloud feedbacks appear to depend on two important aspects: (1) how cloudiness near cloud-base is controlled by the local interplay between turbulent, convective and radiative processes; (2) how these processes interact with their surrounding environment and are influenced by mesoscale organization. Our synthesis of studies that have explored these aspects suggests that the large diversity of model responses is related to fundamental differences in how the processes controlling trade cumulus operate in models, notably, whether they are parameterized or resolved. In models with parameterized convection, cloudiness near cloud-base is very sensitive to the vigor of convective mixing in response to changes in environmental conditions. This is in contrast with results from high-resolution models, which suggest that cloudiness near cloud-base is nearly invariant with warming and independent of large-scale environmental changes. Uncertainties are difficult to narrow using current observations, as the trade cumulus variability and its relation to large-scale environmental factors strongly depend on the time and/or spatial scales at which the mechanisms are evaluated. New opportunities for testing physical understanding of the factors controlling shallow cumulus cloud responses using observations and highresolution modeling on large domains are discussed.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric humidity, clouds, precipitation, and evapotranspiration are essential components of the Arctic climate system. During recent decades, specific humidity and precipitation have generally increased in the Arctic, but changes in evapotranspiration are poorly known. Trends in clouds vary depending on the region and season. Climate model experiments suggest that increases in precipitation are related to global warming. In turn, feedbacks associated with the increase in atmospheric moisture and decrease in sea ice and snow cover have contributed to the Arctic amplification of global warming. Climate models have captured the overall wetting trend but have limited success in reproducing regional details. For the rest of the 21st century, climate models project strong warming and increasing precipitation, but different models yield different results for changes in cloud cover. The model differences are largest in months of minimum sea ice cover. Evapotranspiration is projected to increase in winter but in summer to decrease over the oceans and increase over land. Increasing net precipitation increases river discharge to the Arctic Ocean. Over sea ice in summer, projected increase in rain and decrease in snowfall decrease the surface albedo and, hence, further amplify snow/ice surface melt. With reducing sea ice, wind forcing on the Arctic Ocean increases with impacts on ocean currents and freshwater transport out of the Arctic. Improvements in observations, process understanding, and modeling capabilities are needed to better quantify the atmospheric role in the Arctic water cycle and its changes.},

  abstract = {The radiative and turbulent heat fluxes between the snow-covered sea ice and the atmosphere were analyzed on the basis of observations during the Ice Station Polarstern (ISPOL) in the western Weddell Sea from 28 November 2004 to 2 January 2005. The net heat flux to the snowpack was 3 {$\pm$} 2 W m-2 (mean {$\pm$} standard deviation; defined positive toward snow), consisting of the net shortwave radiation (52 {$\pm$} 8 W m-2), net longwave radiation (-29 {$\pm$} 4 W m-2), latent heat flux (-14 {$\pm$} 5 W m-2), and sensible heat flux (-6 {$\pm$} 5 W m-2). The snowpack receives heat at daytime while releases heat every night. Snow thinning was due to approximately equal contributions of the increase of snow density, melt, and evaporation. The surface albedo only decreased from 0.9 to 0.8. During a case of cold air advection, the sensible heat flux was even below -50 W m-2. At night, the snow surface temperature was strongly controlled by the incoming longwave radiation. The diurnal cycle in the downward solar radiation drove diurnal cycles in 14 other variables. Comparisons against observations from the Arctic sea ice in summer indicated that at ISPOL the air was colder, surface albedo was higher, and a larger portion of the absorbed solar radiation was returned to the atmosphere via turbulent heat fluxes. The limited melt allowed larger diurnal cycles. Due to regional differences in atmospheric circulation and ice conditions, the ISPOL results cannot be fully generalized for the entire Antarctic sea ice zone.},

TRACMIP studies the dynamics of tropical rain belts and their response to past and future radiative forcings through simulations with 13 comprehensive and one simplified atmosphere models coupled to a slab ocean and driven by seasonally varying insolation. Five idealized experiments, two with an aquaplanet setup and three with a setup with an idealized tropical continent, fill the space between prescribed-SST aquaplanet simulations and realistic simulations provided by CMIP5/6. The simulations reproduce key features of present-day climate and expected future climate change, including an annual-mean intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) that is located north of the equator and Hadley cells and eddy-driven jets that are similar to present-day climate. Quadrupling CO2 leads to a northward ITCZ shift and preferential warming in Northern high latitudes. The simulations show interesting CO2-induced changes in the seasonal excursion of the ITCZ and indicate a possible state dependence of climate sensitivity. The inclusion of an idealized continent modulates both the control climate and the response to increased CO2; for example, it reduces the northward ITCZ shift associated with warming and, in some models, climate sensitivity. In response to eccentricity-driven seasonal insolation changes, seasonal changes in oceanic rainfall are best characterized as a meridional dipole, while seasonal continental rainfall changes tend to be symmetric about the equator. This survey illustrates TRACMIP's potential to engender a deeper understanding of global and regional climate and to address questions on past and future climate change.},

We review the impact of cloud-radiation interactions for the atmospheric circulation in the present-day climate, its internal variability and its response to climate change. After summarizing cloud-controlling factors and cloud-radiative effects, we clarify the scope and limits of the Clouds On-Off Klimate Model Intercomparison Experiment (COOKIE) and cloud-locking modeling methods. COOKIE showed that the presence of cloud-radiative effects shapes the circulation in the present-day climate in many important ways, including the width of the tropical rain belts and the position of the extratropical storm tracks. Cloud locking, in contrast, identified how clouds affect internal variability and the circulation response to global warming. This includes strong, but model-dependent, shortwave and longwave cloud impacts on the El-Nino Southern Oscillation, and the finding that most of the poleward circulation expansion in response to global warming can be attributed to radiative changes in clouds. We highlight the circulation impact of shortwave changes from low-level clouds and longwave changes from rising high-level clouds, and the contribution of these cloud changes to model differences in the circulation response to global warming. The review in particular draws attention to the role of cloud-radiative heating within the atmosphere. We close by raising some open questions which, among others, concern the need for studying the cloud impact on regional scales and opportunities created by the next generation of global storm-resolving models.

In contrast to the Hadley cell of modern Earth, momentum transport by dry convection, which is modeled as vertical diffusion of momentum, is important in the upper branch of the snowball Earth Hadley cell. In the zonal momentum balance, mean meridional advection of mean absolute vorticity is not only balanced by eddies but also by vertical diffusion of zonal momentum. Vertical diffusion also contributes to the meridional momentum balance by decelerating the Hadley cell through downgradient mixing of meridional momentum between its upper and lower branches. When vertical diffusion of momentum is suppressed in the upper branch, the Hadley cell strengthens by a factor of about 2. This is in line with the effect of vertical diffusion in the meridional momentum balance but in contrast with its effect in the zonal momentum balance. Neither axisymmetric Hadley cell theories based on angular momentum conservation nor eddy-permitting Hadley cell theories that neglect vertical diffusion of momentum are applicable to the snowball Earth Hadley cell. Because the snowball Earth Hadley cell is a particular realization of a dry Hadley cell, these results show that an appropriate description of dry Hadley cells should take into account vertical transport of momentum by dry convection.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract Climate models robustly project that global warming will lead to a poleward shift of the annual-mean zonal-mean extratropical jet streams. The magnitude of such shifts remains uncertain, however, and recent work has indicated a potentially important role of cloud radiative interactions. The model spread found in realistic simulations with interactive sea surface temperatures (SSTs) is captured in aquaplanet simulations with prescribed SSTs, because of which the latter setup is adapted here to study the impact of regional atmospheric cloud radiative changes on the jet position. Simulations with two CMIP5 models and prescribed regional cloud changes show that the rise of tropical high-level clouds and the upward and poleward movement of midlatitude high-level clouds lead to poleward jet shifts. High-latitude low-level cloud changes shift the jet poleward in one model but not in the other. The impact of clouds on the jet operates via the atmospheric radiative forcing that is created by the cloud changes and is qualitatively reproduced in a dry model, although the latter is too sensitive because of its simplified treatment of diabatic processes. The 10-model CMIP5 aquaplanet ensemble of global warming exhibits correlations between jet shifts, regional temperature changes, and regional cloud changes that are consistent with the prescribed cloud simulations. This provides evidence that the atmospheric radiative forcing from tropical and midlatitude high-level cloud changes contributes to model uncertainty in future jet shifts, in addition to the surface radiative forcing from extratropical cloud changes highlighted by previous studies.},

This is the most sophisticated model ever applied to Snowball initiation. A comparison with a pre-industrial control climate shows that the change of surface boundary conditions from present-day to Marinoan, including a shift of continents to low latitudes, induces a global-mean cooling of 4.6 K. Two thirds of this cooling can be attributed to increased planetary albedo, the remaining one third to a weaker greenhouse effect. The Marinoan Snowball Earth bifurcation point for pre-industrial atmospheric carbon dioxide is between 95.5 and 96\% of the present-day total solar irradiance (TSI), whereas a previous study with the same model found that it was between 91 and 94\% for present-day surface boundary conditions. A Snowball Earth for TSI set to its Marinoan value (94\% of the present-day TSI) is prevented by doubling carbon dioxide with respect to its pre-industrial level. A zero-dimensional energy balance model is used to predict the Snowball Earth bifurcation point from only the equilibrium global-mean ocean potential temperature for present-day TSI. We do not find stable states with sea-ice cover above 55\%, and land conditions are such that glaciers could not grow with sea-ice cover of 55\%. Therefore, none of our simulations qualifies as a "slushball" solution. While uncertainties in important processes and parameters such as clouds and sea-ice albedo suggest that the Snowball Earth bifurcation point differs between climate models, our results contradict previous findings that Snowball Earth initiation would require much stronger forcings.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Uncovering universal early warning signals for critical transitions has become a coveted goal in diverse scientific disciplines, ranging from climate science to financial mathematics. There has been a flurry of recent research proposing such signals, with increasing autocorrelation and increasing variance being among the most widely discussed candidates. A number of studies have suggested that increasing autocorrelation alone may suffice to signal an impending transition, although some others have questioned this. Here we consider variance and autocorrelation in the context of sea ice loss in an idealized model of the global climate system. The model features no bifurcation, nor increased rate of retreat, as the ice disappears. Nonetheless, the autocorrelation of summer sea ice area is found to increase in a global warming scenario. The variance, by contrast, decreases. A simple physical mechanism is proposed to explain the occurrence of increasing autocorrelation but not variance when there is no approaching bifurcation. Additionally, a similar mechanism is shown to allow an increase in both indicators with no physically attainable bifurcation. This implies that relying on autocorrelation and variance as early warning signals can raise false alarms in the climate system, warning of ``tipping points'' that are not actually there.},

  abstract = {Abstract Record lows in Arctic sea ice extent have been making frequent headlines in recent years. The change in albedo when sea ice is replaced by open water introduces a nonlinearity that has sparked an ongoing debate about the stability of the Arctic sea ice cover and the possibility of Arctic ``tipping points.'' Previous studies identified instabilities for a shrinking ice cover in two types of idealized climate models: (i) annual-mean latitudinally varying diffusive energy balance models (EBMs) and (ii) seasonally varying single-column models (SCMs). The instabilities in these low-order models stand in contrast with results from comprehensive global climate models (GCMs), which typically do not simulate any such instability. To help bridge the gap between low-order models and GCMs, an idealized model is developed that includes both latitudinal and seasonal variations. The model reduces to a standard EBM or SCM as limiting cases in the parameter space, thus reconciling the two previous lines of research. It is found that the stability of the ice cover vastly increases with the inclusion of spatial communication via meridional heat transport or a seasonal cycle in solar forcing, being most stable when both are included. If the associated parameters are set to values that correspond to the current climate, the ice retreat is reversible and there is no instability when the climate is warmed. The two parameters have to be reduced by at least a factor of 3 for instability to occur. This implies that the sea ice cover may be substantially more stable than has been suggested in previous idealized modeling studies.},

On the other hand, the ice near the pole will thin, causing faster ice growth when air temperatures are below freezing. This prompts the fundamental question whether equatorward ice motion increases or decreases ice area and volume? We investigate this using an idealized climate model with a representation of sea ice thermodynamic processes and specified sea ice drift. We find that equatorward ice drift leads to consistent loss of ice volume. The impact of ice motion on ice area depends on seasonal factors and the background climate: When there is enough ice, equatorward ice motion slightly expands ice area. For thinner ice, however, motion during the melt season can create polynyas and cause substantial ice loss that persists throughout the year.},

This campaign was the first of its kind in the North Atlantic sector of the Arctic. This study describes the atmospheric and surface conditions and the radiative and turbulent heat fluxes over young, thin sea ice. The shortwave albedo of the snow surface ranged from about 0.85 in winter to 0.72\textendash 0.80 in early summer. The near-surface atmosphere was typically stable in winter, unstable in spring, and near neutral in summer once the surface skin temperature reached 0\textdegree C. The daily average radiative and turbulent heat fluxes typically sum to negative values (-40 to 0 W m-2) in winter but then transition toward positive values of up to nearly +60 W m-2 as solar radiation contributes significantly to the surface energy budget. The sensible heat flux typically ranges from +20\textendash 30 W m-2 in winter (into the surface) to negative values between 0 and -20 W m-2 in spring and summer. A winter case study highlights the significant effect of synoptic storms and demonstrates the complex interplay of wind, clouds, and heat and moisture advection on the surface energy components over sea ice in winter. A spring case study contrasts a rare period of 24 h of clear-sky conditions with typical overcast conditions and highlights the impact of clouds on the surface radiation and energy budgets over young, thin sea ice.},

Taken together, these characteristics of the organization and structure of obs4MIPs should entice a more diverse community of researchers to engage in the comparison of model output with observations and to contribute to a more comprehensive evaluation of the climate models.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}At present, the number of obs4MIPs datasets has grown to about 80; many are undergoing updates, with another 20 or so in preparation, and more than 100 are proposed and under consideration. A partial list of current global satellite-based datasets includes humidity and temperature profiles; a wide range of cloud and aerosol observations; ocean surface wind, temperature, height, and sea ice fraction; surface and top-of-atmosphere longwave and shortwave radiation; and ozone (O\textsubscript{3}), methane (CH\textsubscript{4}), and carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}) products. A partial list of proposed products expected to be useful in analyzing CMIP6 results includes the following: alternative products for the above quantities, additional products for ocean surface flux and chlorophyll products, a number of vegetation products (e.g., FAPAR, LAI, burned area fraction), ice sheet mass and height, carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}). While most existing obs4MIPs datasets consist of monthly-mean gridded data over the global domain, products with higher time resolution (e.g., daily) and/or regional products are now receiving more attention.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Along with an increasing number of datasets, obs4MIPs has implemented a number of capability upgrades including (1) an updated obs4MIPs data specifications document that provides additional search facets and generally improves congruence with CMIP6 specifications for model datasets, (2) a set of six easily understood indicators that help guide users as to a dataset's maturity and suitability for application, and (3) an option to supply supplemental information about a dataset beyond what can be found in the standard metadata. With the maturation of the obs4MIPs framework, the dataset inclusion process, and the dataset formatting guidelines and resources, the scope of the observations being considered is expected to grow to include gridded in situ datasets as well as datasets with a regional focus, and the ultimate intent is to judiciously expand this scope to any observation dataset that has applicability for evaluation of the types of Earth system models used in CMIP.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Cloud properties are very sensitive to the strength of vertical motion in the midtroposphere, and low-cloud properties are sensitive to estimated inversion strength, low-level temperature advection, and sea surface temperature. These relationships are quantified. An index for the meteorological anomalies associated with midlatitude cyclones is presented, and it is used to reveal the sensitivity of clouds to the meteorology within the warm and cold sectors of cyclones. The observed relationships between clouds and meteorology are compared to those in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), using satellite simulators. Low clouds simulated by CAM5 are too few, are too bright, and contain too much ice. In the cold sector of cyclones, the low clouds are also too sensitive to variations in the meteorology. When CAM5 is coupled with an updated boundary layer parameterization known as Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB), bias in the ice content of low clouds is dramatically reduced. More generally, this study demonstrates that examining the instantaneous time scale is a powerful approach to understanding the physical processes that control clouds and how they are represented in climate models. Such an evaluation goes beyond the cloud climatology and exposes model bias under various meteorological conditions.},

The statistics of Arctic sea level pressure and temperature are evaluated in order to place Arctic atmospheric variability into the context of fluctuations elsewhere. The persistence of monthly sea level pressure anomalies in the Arctic is smaller than in the subtropics but greater than in middle latitudes. This persistence is strongest in winter. Air temperature anomalies are less persistent in the Arctic than in lower latitudes, except during the autumn freeze-up season. Monthly Arctic pressure anomalies show a relatively strong association with concurrent anomalies in the North Atlantic, especially during the winter half of the year. Associations with North Pacific anomalies are weak. During the past twenty years, the greatest warming has occurred over Alaska, the North Atlantic marginal ice zone, and north central Asia. Cooling has occurred over much of Europe, especially Scandinavia. The COADS sea surface temperature changes support the pattern of temperature change derived from land station data. The pattern of recent high-latitude temperature change is consistent with and at least partially attributable to corresponding changes in the sea level pressure (gradient wind) field.},

Results show that the Gulf Stream (Kuroshio) weakens (strengthens) in response to Arctic sea ice loss via ocean (atmosphere) adjustments. More precisely, the Kuroshio acceleration is mainly due to the anomalous wind stress over the North Pacific, while the ocean gyre adjustments in the Atlantic are responsible for the weakened Gulf Stream. As positive buoyancy fluxes induced by Arctic sea ice loss trigger a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), the Gulf Stream decelerates evidently and the current speed decreases by about 5\textendash 8 cm/s in the upper ocean. Resulting from less advection and horizontal diffusion in the temperature budget, less poleward warm water leads to narrow sea surface cooling sandwiched between strong warming in the subpolar and subtropical Atlantic. Furthermore, colder surface decreases the upward heat flux (mainly latent heat flux) along the Gulf Stream Extension (GE) path, which leads to a warming hole in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the concept of global monsoon. We demonstrate that the primary climatological features of the tropical precipitation and low-level circulation can be represented by a three-parameter metrics: the annual mean and two major modes of annual variation, namely, a solstitial mode and an equinoctial asymmetric mode. Together, the two major modes of annual cycle account for 84\% of the annual variance and they represent the global monsoon. The global monsoon precipitation domain can be delineated by a simple monsoon precipitation index (MPI), which is the local annual range of precipitation (MJJAS minus NDJFM in the Northern Hemisphere and NDJFM minus MJJAS in the Southern Hemisphere) normalized by the annual mean precipitation. The monsoon domain can be defined by annual range exceeding 300mm and the MPI exceeding 50\%. The three-parameter precipitation climatology metrics and global monsoon domain proposed in the present paper provides a valuable objective tool for gauging the climate models' performance on simulation and prediction of the mean climate and annual cycle. The metrics are used to evaluate the precipitation climatology in three global reanalysis products (ERA40, NCEP2, and JRA25) in terms of their pattern correlation coefficients and root mean square errors with reference to observations. The ensemble mean of the three analysis datasets is considerably superior to any of the individual reanalysis data in representing annual mean, annual cycle, and the global monsoon domain. A major common deficiency is found over the Southeast Asia-Philippine Sea and southeast North America-Caribbean Sea where the east\textendash west land\textendash ocean thermal contrast and meridional hemispheric thermal contrast coexist. It is speculated that the weakness is caused by models' unrealistic representation of Subtropical High and under-represented tropical storm activity, as well as by neglecting atmosphere\textendash ocean interaction in the reanalysis. It is recommended that ensemble mean of reanalysis datasets be used for improving global precipitation climatology and water cycle budget. This paper also explains why the latitudinal asymmetry in the tropical circulation decreases with altitude.},

It remains a debated issue, however, as to what extent and at which timescales the global monsoon can be viewed as a major mode of climate variability. For this purpose, a PAGES (Past Global Changes) working group (WG) was set up to investigate the concept of the global monsoon and its future research directions. The WG's synthesis is presented here. On the basis of observation and proxy data, the WG found that the regional monsoons can vary coherently, although not perfectly, at various timescales, varying between interannual, interdecadal, centennial, millennial, orbital and tectonic timescales, conforming to the global monsoon concept across timescales. Within the global monsoon system, each subsystem has its own features, depending on its geographic and topographic conditions. Discrimination between global and regional components in the monsoon system is a key to revealing the driving factors in monsoon variations; hence, the global monsoon concept helps to enhance our understanding and to improve future projections of the regional monsoons. This paper starts with a historical review of the global monsoon concept in both modern and paleo-climatology, and an assessment of monsoon proxies used in regional and global scales. The main body of the paper is devoted to a summary of observation data at various timescales, providing evidence of the coherent global monsoon system. The paper concludes with a projection of future monsoon shifts in a warming world. The synthesis will be followed by a companion paper addressing driving mechanisms and outstanding issues in global monsoon studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The possibility of water vapor transport from the troposphere to the stratosphere by deep convection is investigated using three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic, quasi-compressible simulations of a Midwest severe thunderstorm. The results show that the breaking of gravity waves at the cloud top can cause cloud water vapor to be injected into the stratosphere in the form of plumes above a thunderstorm anvil. Meteorological satellites and aircrafts have observed such plumes previously, but the source of water vapor and the injection mechanism were not identified. The present results reveal that there are two types of plumes, anvil sheet plumes and overshooting plumes, in this injection process and that the process is diabatic. A first-order estimate of this plume transport of water vapor per day from the upper troposphere to the lower stratosphere was made assuming that all thunderstorms behave the same as the one simulated. Other trace chemicals may also be similarly transported by the same mechanism.},

Here we provide a review on past monsoon changes and their primary drivers, the projected future changes, and key physical processes, and discuss challenges of the present and future modeling and outlooks. Continued global warming and urbanization over the past century has already caused a significant rise in the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events in all monsoon regions (high confidence). Observed changes in the mean monsoon rainfall vary by region with significant decadal variations. Northern Hemisphere land monsoon rainfall as a whole declined from 1950 to 1980 and rebounded after the 1980s, due to the competing influences of internal climate variability and radiative forcing from greenhouse gases and aerosol forcing (high confidence); however, it remains a challenge to quantify their relative contributions. The CMIP6 models simulate better global monsoon intensity and precipitation over CMIP5 models, but common biases and large intermodal spreads persist. Nevertheless, there is high confidence that the frequency and intensity of monsoon extreme rainfall events will increase, alongside an increasing risk of drought over some regions. Also, land monsoon rainfall will increase in South Asia and East Asia (high confidence) and northern Africa (medium confidence), decrease in North America, and be unchanged in the Southern Hemisphere. Over the Asian\textendash Australian monsoon region, the rainfall variability is projected to increase on daily to decadal scales. The rainy season will likely be lengthened in the Northern Hemisphere due to late retreat (especially over East Asia), but shortened in the Southern Hemisphere due to delayed onset.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The stationary wave model is linearized about the zonal-mean flow and subjected to the zonally asymmetric stationary wave forcings. It has rhomboidal wavenumber 30 truncation and 14 vertical sigma levels. The forcings for the linear model include diabatic heating, orography, stationary nonlinearity, and transient vorticity and heat flux convergences. The NCEP\textendash NCAR reanalysis provides a high quality global dataset for this study. When the linear model is subjected to all forcings, it reproduces reasonably well the climatological stationary wave seasonal cycle. The linear stationary wave theory is quantitatively valid at the upper-tropospheric levels for all months and the lower-tropospheric levels for the northern summer months (with pattern correlation greater than 0.8). At the middle- and lower-tropospheric levels for most of the months, the stationary wave theory is qualitatively valid (with pattern correlation greater than 0.5). The effect and relative importance of each individual forcing mechanism in maintaining the stationary waves and their seasonal cycle are determined by the linear model. Within the linear model framework, the global diabatic heating is found to be the most dominant forcing mechanism for the climatological stationary waves throughout the seasonal cycle. Subsequently, the seasonal cycle of the stationary waves is largely caused by the seasonal fluctuations of the atmospheric heating field. By comparison, the linear effect of orography is of less importance in both the Tropics and the extratropics. The effect of stationary nonlinearity is to modify the spatial structure of the stationary waves, particularly over extratropical North America. Comparatively, transient forcing has little contribution. By separating the tropical and the extratropical heatings in the linear model, it is found that the local thermal forcing has the dominant contribution to the local stationary wave seasonal cycle. The relative contribution of the seasonally varying zonal-mean basic state and the seasonally varying forcing fields is also examined using the linear model. The seasonally varying zonal-mean basic state can account for the zonal-mean amplitude fluctuation of the stationary waves in the Tropics, as well as the seasonal change of the stationary wave spatial structure from September to May. It fails to capture the amplitude fluctuation of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical stationary waves and the northern summer stationary wave spatial structure. On the other hand, the effect of the seasonally varying forcing accounts largely for the zonal-mean amplitude fluctuation of the stationary waves in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, as well as the transition to the northern summer stationary wave regime.},

These changes in annual mean SST are noteworthy since in simple climate models the SOM thickness controls the amplitude and phase of the SST annual cycle, but it plays no role in determining the annual mean SST. Results from the numerical experiment indicate that halving of the SOM thickness not only changes annual cycle amplitude but results in asymmetrical changes in the annual cycle that rectify onto annual mean SST. The changed SOM thickness is found to primarily affect the surface net solar flux and latent heat flux components. However, due to the SOM equilibrium energy budget constraint, the annual mean net surface heat flux does not change, and the solar and latent heat fluxes changes compensate for each other. There is no such constraint on the annual cycle of heat fluxes, where the solar and latent components act to reinforce each other over much of the ocean, with the notable exception of the tropic Pacific warm pool region. We investigate the influence of the amplitude of the SST annual cycle on the annual mean SST through the net surface heat flux and its components using a two-step approach. First, two prescribed SST AGCM simulations are carried out, both with the annual mean SST of the full-thickness SOM coupled model simulation: one forced with the SST annual cycle of the full-thickness SOM coupled simulation, and the other forced with the SST annual cycle of the half-thickness SOM coupled simulation. Second, the impacts of these changes in the annual cycle on the annual mean SST are assessed in a full-thickness AGCM-SOM coupled simulation forced by the net, annual-mean, surface heat flux changes produced by the SST annual cycle changes in the first step. It is found that these net surface heat flux changes can largely reproduce the annual mean SST sensitivity to SOM thickness found in the coupled SOM thickness halving experiment. The effects on the annual mean heat flux components and annual mean SST from changes in the SOM thickness in an idealized limiting case are also considered.},

  abstract = {Stratospheric water vapor (SWV) is recognized as a potentially important positive feedback in global warming. The SWV change induces significant downward radiative flux perturbation at the tropopause and therefore is hypothesized to substantially amplify the surface warming. To test this hypothesis, we use a global climate model to quantify the surface warming contributed by the SWV change in the context of the quadrupled CO2. By prescribing the SWV increase as an external forcing, we find that SWV only accounts for 0.42 K surface warming, making up merely 5.4\% of the total CO2-caused surface warming (7.7 K). The efficacy of the stratosphere-adjusted SWV forcing is small (38\%), where the efficacy is defined as the ratio of the global temperature response per unit radiative forcing relative to that of the CO2 forcing. With the aid of a series of auxiliary experiments, we find that although the stratosphere-adjusted SWV forcing at the top of atmosphere (TOA) is significant (1.13 W m-2), more than half of the forcing is offset by a high-cloud decrease and an upper tropospheric warming in the tropospheric adjustment. The direct radiative impact of the SWV increase on surface temperature is negligible, and the SWV-induced surface temperature change is a result of interactions between the radiative and nonradiative processes.},

This study examines the formation mechanisms of these convergence zones in cold air outbreaks downstream of a coastline or sea ice edge. A simplified configuration in which the coastline or sea ice edge is approximated by a line featuring a bend with an angle is examined using analytic solutions and idealised numerical simulations. The bend of the coastline causes differences in the fetch over which air parcels travel, causing a warm wedge of air downstream of the bend due to differential airmass transformations. The warm wedge is associated with a pressure trough that leads to convergence in the presence of surface friction. The analytic model captures this mechanism and compares well with the idealised numerical simulations. Condensational heating associated with moist convection enhances vertical motions and thus intensifies the horizontal convergence. The idealised numerical simulations also reproduce an asymmetry in the vertical shear of the horizontal wind across the convergence zone, which explains the transverse cloud streets downstream to the left of the convergence zone.},

However, the cause is controversial because a majority of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models suggest weakening of the zonal SST gradient from the past to the future. Reconciling this discrepancy is important for the climate change attribution and climate sensitivity assessment. Here we use the CMIP5 ensemble and large ensemble simulations by four climate models to show that the intensifying SST gradient observed during 1951\textendash 2010 could arise from internal climate variability. Models and members that simulate historical strengthening of the SST gradient commonly exhibit reversed future trends. Using these models as a constraint, the rate of global-mean temperature rise is amplified by 9\textendash 30\%, with higher values occurring in low-emission scenarios, because internal variability has a greater impact when the externally forced response is smaller.},

Most previous studies have quantified changes in total tropical width, focused on the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell or considered each hemisphere's response to a multitude of anthropogenic forcings. It is shown here that under exclusive CO2 forcing, climate models predict twice as much Hadley cell expansion in the Southern Hemisphere relative to the Northern Hemisphere. This asymmetry is present in the annual mean expansion and all seasons except boreal autumn. It is robust across models and Hadley cell edge definitions. It is surprising since asymmetries in simulated Hadley cell expansion are typically attributed to stratospheric ozone depletion or aerosol emission. Its primary cause is smaller sensitivity of the Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell to static stability changes. The pattern of sea surface warming and the CO2 direct radiative effect also contribute to the asymmetry.},

Here, we specifically focus on the zonal asymmetries in the southern hemisphere wind trends between 1980 and 2018. Meteorological reanalyses show a large strengthening and a statistically insignificant equatorward shift of peak near-surface winds over the Pacific, in contrast to a weaker strengthening and significant poleward shift over the Atlantic and Indian Ocean sectors. The reanalysis trends fall within the ensemble spread for historical climate model simulations, showing that climate models are able to capture the observed trends.

This is, likely, in part due to the wide variety of metrics that have been used to define the tropical width. Here we perform a systematic investigation into the relationship among nine metrics of the zonal-mean tropical width using preindustrial control and abrupt quadrupling of CO\textsubscript{2} simulations from a suite of coupled climate models. It is shown that the latitudes of the edge of the Hadley cell, the midlatitude eddy-driven jet, the edge of the subtropical dry zones, and the Southern Hemisphere subtropical high covary interannually and exhibit similar long-term responses to a quadrupling of CO\textsubscript{2}. However, metrics based on the outgoing longwave radiation, the position of the subtropical jet, the break in the tropopause, and the Northern Hemisphere subtropical high have very weak covariations with the above metrics and/or respond differently to increases in CO\textsubscript{2} and thus are not good indicators of the expansion of the Hadley cell or subtropical dry zone. The differing variability and responses to increases in CO\textsubscript{2} among metrics highlights that care is needed when choosing metrics for studies of the width of the tropics and that it is important to make sure the metric used is appropriate for the specific phenomena and impacts being examined.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

Here, we clarify what is meant by polar vortices in the atmospheric science literature. It is important to recognize the existence of two separate planetary-scale circumpolar vortices: one in the stratosphere and the other in the troposphere. These vortices have different structures, seasonality, dynamics, and impacts on extreme weather. The tropospheric vortex is much larger than its stratospheric counterpart and exists year-round, whereas the stratospheric polar vortex forms in fall but disappears in the spring of each year. Both vortices can, in some circumstances, play a role in extreme weather events at the surface, such as cold-air outbreaks, but these events are not the consequence of either the existence or gross properties of these two vortices. Rather, cold-air outbreaks are most directly related to transient, localized displacements of the edge of the tropospheric polar vortex that may, in some circumstances, be related to the stratospheric polar vortex, but there is no known one-to-one connection between these phenomena.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Radiative equilibrium solutions are the starting point in our attempt to understand how the atmospheric composition governs the surface and atmospheric temperatures, and the greenhouse effect. The Schwarzschild analytical grey gas model (SGM) was the workhorse of such attempts. However, the solutions suffered from serious deficiencies when applied to Earth's atmosphere and were abandoned about 3 decades ago in favor of more sophisticated computer models. Here we show that simple heuristic modifications to the SGM resolve these deficiencies, at least the catastrophic ones. The modifications include the addition of a spectral window, as well as allowing the scale height of optical depth to be different from that of the atmospheric pressure. The modified SGM reveals the fundamental factors that govern the radiative equilibrium thermal structure. (1) The presence of a spectral window allows the temperature jump between the surface and the immediately overlying atmosphere to become small, irrespective of the magnitude of the surface temperature. (2) In an optically thick atmosphere (such as Earth and Venus), the surface temperature and the runaway greenhouse effect depend inversely (as the one-fourth power) on the Planck function-weighted width of the window and are independent of the optical depth and other atmospheric parameters. The vertical variation of temperature within the atmosphere, however, is determined by the vertical variation of optical depth. (3) The degree of convective instability of the radiative equilibrium thermal structure {$\gamma$} is proportional to the ratio H/H{$\tau$}, where H is the atmospheric scale height and H{$\tau$} is the scale height of the vertical variation of optical depth. Here, {$\gamma$} is the ratio of the radiative equilibrium lapse rate and the neutral lapse rate for dry convection; {$\gamma$} {$>$} 1 indicates that the profile is unstable to free convection. Thus H{$\tau$} {$<$} H emerges as one of the fundamental criteria for convective instability. These factors lead to several corollaries regarding the specific details of atmospheric thermal structure on Earth and Venus. For example, according to the modified SGM, the radiative equilibrium temperature profile is strongly superadiabatic in Earth's lower atmosphere because H{$\tau$} is dominated by the water vapor's scale height being much less (2 compared with 8 km) than the atmospheric scale height. In the case of Venus, the pressure broadening of the CO2 rotational lines makes H{$\tau$} a factor of 2 smaller than H. Some of these results have been obtained using more detailed, multispectral radiative equilibrium models.},

  abstract = {Global and local feedback analysis techniques have been applied to two ensembles of mixed layer equilibrium CO2 doubling climate change experiments, from the CFMIP (Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project) and QUMP (Quantifying Uncertainty in Model Predictions) projects. Neither of these new ensembles shows evidence of a statistically significant change in the ensemble mean or variance in global mean climate sensitivity when compared with the results from the mixed layer models quoted in the Third Assessment Report of the IPCC. Global mean feedback analysis of these two ensembles confirms the large contribution made by inter-model differences in cloud feedbacks to those in climate sensitivity in earlier studies; net cloud feedbacks are responsible for 66\% of the inter-model variance in the total feedback in the CFMIP ensemble and 85\% in the QUMP ensemble. The ensemble mean global feedback components are all statistically indistinguishable between the two ensembles, except for the clear-sky shortwave feedback which is stronger in the CFMIP ensemble. While ensemble variances of the shortwave cloud feedback and both clear-sky feedback terms are larger in CFMIP, there is considerable overlap in the cloud feedback ranges; QUMP spans 80\% or more of the CFMIP ranges in longwave and shortwave cloud feedback. We introduce a local cloud feedback classification system which distinguishes different types of cloud feedbacks on the basis of the relative strengths of their longwave and shortwave components, and interpret these in terms of responses of different cloud types diagnosed by the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project simulator. In the CFMIP ensemble, areas where low-top cloud changes constitute the largest cloud response are responsible for 59\% of the contribution from cloud feedback to the variance in the total feedback. A similar figure is found for the QUMP ensemble. Areas of positive low cloud feedback (associated with reductions in low level cloud amount) contribute most to this figure in the CFMIP ensemble, while areas of negative cloud feedback (associated with increases in low level cloud amount and optical thickness) contribute most in QUMP. Classes associated with high-top cloud feedbacks are responsible for 33 and 20\% of the cloud feedback contribution in CFMIP and QUMP, respectively, while classes where no particular cloud type stands out are responsible for 8 and 21\%.},

  abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of cloud feedbacks to the use of convective parametrizations by repeating the CMIP5/CFMIP-2 AMIP/AMIP + 4K uniform sea surface temperature perturbation experiments with 10 climate models which have had their convective parametrizations turned off. Previous studies have suggested that differences between parametrized convection schemes are a leading source of inter-model spread in cloud feedbacks. We find however that `ConvOff' models with convection switched off have a similar overall range of cloud feedbacks compared with the standard configurations. Furthermore, applying a simple bias correction method to allow for differences in present-day global cloud radiative effects substantially reduces the differences between the cloud feedbacks with and without parametrized convection in the individual models. We conclude that, while parametrized convection influences the strength of the cloud feedbacks substantially in some models, other processes must also contribute substantially to the overall inter-model spread. The positive shortwave cloud feedbacks seen in the models in subtropical regimes associated with shallow clouds are still present in the ConvOff experiments. Inter-model spread in shortwave cloud feedback increases slightly in regimes associated with trade cumulus in the ConvOff experiments but is quite similar in the most stable subtropical regimes associated with stratocumulus clouds. Inter-model spread in longwave cloud feedbacks in strongly precipitating regions of the tropics is substantially reduced in the ConvOff experiments however, indicating a considerable local contribution from differences in the details of convective parametrizations. In both standard and ConvOff experiments, models with less mid-level cloud and less moist static energy near the top of the boundary layer tend to have more positive tropical cloud feedbacks. The role of non-convective processes in contributing to inter-model spread in cloud feedback is discussed.},

In both ensembles, differences in climate feedbacks can account for approximately twice as much of the range in climate sensitivity as differences in CO2 forcing. In the AR4 ensemble, cloud effects can explain the full range of climate sensitivities, and cloud feedback components contribute four times as much as cloud components of CO2 forcing to the range. Non-cloud feedbacks are required to fully account for the high sensitivities of some models however. The largest contribution to the high sensitivity of HadGEM1 is from a high latitude clear-sky shortwave feedback, and clear-sky longwave feedbacks contribute substantially to the highest sensitivity members of the PPE. Differences in low latitude ocean regions (30\textdegree N/S) contribute more to the range than those in mid-latitude oceans (30\textendash 55\textdegree N/S), low/mid latitude land (55\textdegree N/S) or high latitude ocean/land (55\textendash 90\textdegree N/S), but contributions from these other regions are required to account fully for the higher model sensitivities, for example from land areas in IPSL CM4. Net cloud feedback components over the low latitude oceans sorted into percentile ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS) show largest differences among models in stable regions, mainly due to their shortwave components, most of which are positive in spite of increasing LTS. Differences in the mid-stability range are smaller, but cover a larger area, contributing a comparable amount to the range in climate sensitivity. These are strongly anti-correlated with changes in subsidence. Cloud components of CO2 forcing also show the largest differences in stable regions, and are strongly anticorrelated with changes in estimated inversion strength (EIS). This is qualitatively consistent with what would be expected from observed relationships between EIS and low-level cloud fraction. We identify a number of cases where individual models show unusually strong forcings and feedbacks compared to other members of the ensemble. We encourage modelling groups to investigate unusual model behaviours further with sensitivity experiments. Most of the models fail to correctly reproduce the observed relationships between stability and cloud radiative effect in the subtropics, indicating that there remains considerable room for model improvements in the future.},

The World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS) program seeks to explore predictability of the global climate system through investigation of the major planetary heat sources and sinks, and interactions between them. The Asian-Australian monsoon system, which undergoes aperiodic and high amplitude variations on intraseasonal, annual, biennial and interannual timescales is a major focus of GOALS. Empirical seasonal forecasts of the monsoon have been made with moderate success for over 100 years. More recent modeling efforts have not been successful. Even simulation of the mean structure of the Asian monsoon has proven elusive and the observed ENSO-monsoon relationships has been difficult to replicate. Divergence in simulation skill occurs between integrations by different models or between members of ensembles of the same model. This degree of spread is surprising given the relative success of empirical forecast techniques. Two possible explanations are presented: difficulty in modeling the monsoon regions and nonlinear error growth due to regional hydrodynamical instabilities. It is argued that the reconciliation of these explanations is imperative for prediction of the monsoon to be improved. To this end, a thorough description of observed monsoon variability and the physical processes that are thought to be important is presented. Prospects of improving prediction and some strategies that may help achieve improvement are discussed.},

The impact of explicitly simulating deep convection on the atmospheric circulation and its variability is assessed by comparing the 1.4 km simulation to the equivalent well-tested and calibrated global simulations at 9 km grid spacing with and without parametrized deep convection. The explicit simulation of deep convection at 1.4 km results in a realistic large-scale circulation, better representation of convective storm activity, and stronger convective gravity wave activity when compared to the 9 km simulation with parametrized deep convection. Comparison of the 1.4 km simulation to the 9 km simulation without parametrized deep convection shows that switching off deep convection parametrization at a too coarse resolution (i.e., 9 km) generates too strong convective gravity waves. Based on the limited statistics available, improvements to the Madden-Julian Oscillation or tropical precipitation are not observed at 1.4 km, suggesting that other Earth system model components and/or their interaction are important for an accurate representation of these processes and may well need adjusting at deep convection resolving resolutions. Overall, the good agreement of the 1.4 km simulation with the 9 km simulation with parametrized deep convection is remarkable, despite one of the most fundamental parametrizations being turned off at 1.4 km resolution and despite no adjustments being made to the remaining parametrizations.},

Both deep and surface ocean temperatures increased by up to 5~\textdegree C in equatorial waters and up to 8~\textdegree C in mid and high latitude waters. From the continents, the annual mean air temperature response during the PETM is still largely unknown, mainly due to a lack of quantitative temperature proxies and sufficient suitable, continuous high resolution records. Recently, a new proxy for continental temperature reconstructions has been proposed, based on the distribution of membrane lipids of bacteria in present-day soils [J.W.H. Weijers, S. Schouten, J.C. van den Donker, E.C. Hopmans, J.S. Sinninghe Damst\'e (2007) Environmental controls on bacterial tetraether membrane lipid distribution in soils, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta 71, 703\textendash 713] and shown to reconstruct annual mean air temperature. In this study we applied this new proxy in an attempt to reconstruct the air temperature in high latitude continental areas during the PETM by analysis of a marine sedimentary sequence obtained from the Lomonosov Ridge in the central Arctic Ocean (Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 302, Site 004, Hole A). The results indicate a warming of {$\sim$}8~\textdegree C above background values of {$\sim$}17~\textdegree C. This warming is coincident with a similar rise in sea surface temperatures documented earlier. Our results thus further confirm the warm conditions in the Arctic, and point to a strongly reduced latitudinal temperature gradient during the PETM.},

By varying the magnitude of buoyant energy and one-directional vertical shear over a wide range of environmental conditions associated with severe storms, the model is able to produce a spectrum of storm types qualitatively similar to those observed in nature. These include short-lived single cells, certain types of multicells and rotating supercells. The relationship between wind shear and buoyancy is expressed in terms of a nondimensional convective parameter which delineates various regimes of storm structure and, in particular, suggests optimal conditions for the development of supercell type storms. Applications of this parameter to well-documented severe storm cases agree favorably with the model results, suggesting both the value of the model in studying these modes of convection as well as the value of this representation in identifying the proper environment for the development of various storm types.},

As with a previous series of experiments using unidirectional wind shear profiles (Weisman and Klemp), the current results evince a spectrum of storm types ranging from short lived single cells at low shears, multicells at intermediate shears, to supercells at high shears. With a clockwise curved hodograph, the supercellular growth is confined to the right flank of the storm system while multicellular growth is favored on the left flank. An analysis of the dynamic structure of the various cells reveals that the quasi-steady supercell updrafts are strongly enhanced by dynamically induced pressure gradients on the right flank of the storm system. We use this feature along with other related storm characteristics (such as updraft rotation) to propose a dynamically based storm classification scheme. Following Browning, this scheme includes two basic storm types: ordinary cells and supercells. Multicell storm systems and squall lines would then be made up of a combination of supercells and ordinary cells. As in the unidirectional shear experiments, a convective bulk Richardson numbercharacterizes the environment conducive to producing particular storm types.},

This term represents the recently observed enhanced warming of the Arctic relative to the global increase of near-surface air temperature. However, there are still important knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between Arctic clouds and aerosol particles, and surface properties, as well as turbulent and radiative fluxes that inhibit accurate model simulations of clouds in the Arctic climate system. In an attempt to resolve this so-called Arctic cloud puzzle, two comprehensive and closely coordinated field studies were conducted: the Arctic Cloud Observations Using Airborne Measurements during Polar Day (ACLOUD) aircraft campaign and the Physical Feedbacks of Arctic Boundary Layer, Sea Ice, Cloud and Aerosol (PASCAL) ice breaker expedition. Both observational studies were performed in the framework of the German Arctic Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and Surface Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC) project. They took place in the vicinity of Svalbard, Norway, in May and June 2017. ACLOUD and PASCAL explored four pieces of the Arctic cloud puzzle: cloud properties, aerosol impact on clouds, atmospheric radiation, and turbulent dynamical processes. The two instrumented Polar 5 and Polar 6 aircraft; the icebreaker Research Vessel (R/V) {$<$}em{$>$}Polarstern{$<$}/em{$>$}; an ice floe camp including an instrumented tethered balloon; and the permanent ground-based measurement station at Ny-\AA lesund, Svalbard, were employed to observe Arctic low- and mid-level mixed-phase clouds and to investigate related atmospheric and surface processes. The Polar 5 aircraft served as a remote sensing observatory examining the clouds from above by downward-looking sensors; the Polar 6 aircraft operated as a flying in situ measurement laboratory sampling inside and below the clouds. Most of the collocated Polar 5/6 flights were conducted either above the R/V {$<$}em{$>$}Polarstern{$<$}/em{$>$} or over the Ny-\AA lesund station, both of which monitored the clouds from below using similar but upward-looking remote sensing techniques as the Polar 5 aircraft. Several of the flights were carried out underneath collocated satellite tracks. The paper motivates the scientific objectives of the ACLOUD/PASCAL observations and describes the measured quantities, retrieved parameters, and the applied complementary instrumentation. Furthermore, it discusses selected measurement results and poses critical research questions to be answered in future papers analyzing the data from the two field campaigns.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

A possible explanation for these differences is by interseasonal variations in cloud thickness and water content in the atmosphere. However, we demonstrate that multiple reflection is mostly responsible for it. In spring there is a very high surface albedo ({$\sim$}80\%), while in summer the surface albedo is low ({$\sim$}15\%). Hence multiple reflection between the surface and the lower extent of the stratus cloud cover is important when snow is on the ground but fairly unimportant after the snow has melted. To verify our assumption, airborne measurements were carried out for the same cloud but over surfaces of different albedos, namely, snow covered tundra ({$\sim$}80\%), broken sea ice (20\textendash 40\%), and open water (4\textendash 16\%). These data show clearly that if the surface albedo is raised, multiple reflection is the cause of the strong increase in irradiation. The interaction by multiple reflections of the spectral characteristics of various ground surfaces with the stratus clouds also was found to be displayed in the spectral irradiance received from the cloud cover.},

On the average, the amount of fractional cloud cover was high (81\%), reducing the incoming solar radiation. The albedo varied widely from over 80\% for snow-covered undisturbed sea ice to below 10\% for open water. In general, sea ice concentration was the strongest determining factor for the reflectivity. However, different ice types and snow cover also had a substantial influence on the reflectivity. When a highly reflecting surface was present (total snow-covered undisturbed ice pack with an albedo of 81\%), the incoming global radiation under overcast conditions was 85\% higher than for a water surface due to multiple reflections. The net radiation was found to be a strong function of both fractional cloud cover and surface albedo. For low albedo values, the net radiation increases with decreasing cloudiness, e.g., for a water surface (albedo 8\%) the mean daily value increased from 88 Wm-2 for total cloud cover to 226 Wm-2 for clear skies. For highly reflecting surfaces, the net radiation decreases with decreasing cloud amount for most of the day. The mean daily value was slightly negative for clear skies (-7 Wm-2), but somewhat positive (23 Wm-2) for overcast conditions.},

Summers with a particularly strong reduction of Arctic sea-ice extent are characterized by anticyclonic circulation anomalies from the surface to the upper troposphere. Here, we investigate the origin of these seasonal circulation anomalies by identifying individual Arctic anticyclones (with a lifetime of typically ten days) and analysing the air mass transport into these systems. We reveal that~ these episodic upper-level induced Arctic anticyclones~are relevant for generating seasonal circulation anomalies. Sea-ice reduction is systematically enhanced during the transient episodes with Arctic anticyclones and the seasonal reduction of sea-ice volume correlates with the area-averaged frequency of Arctic anticyclones poleward of 70\textdegree\,N (correlation coefficient of 0.57). A trajectory analysis shows that these anticyclones result from extratropical cyclones injecting extratropical air masses with low potential vorticity into the Arctic upper troposphere. Our results emphasize the fundamental role of extratropical cyclones and associated diabatic processes in establishing Arctic anticyclones and, in turn, seasonal circulation anomalies, which are of key importance for understanding the variability of summertime Arctic sea-ice melting.},

During the polar night in winter, the net long-wave radiation is the dominant energy loss channel for the surface, which is mainly compensated by the sensible heat flux and, to a lesser extent, by the ground heat flux, which originates from the refreezing of the active layer. The average annual sensible heat flux of \&minus;6.9 Wm\textsuperscript{\&minus;2} is composed of strong positive fluxes in July and August, while negative fluxes dominate during the rest of the year. With 6.8 Wm\textsuperscript{\&minus;2}, the latent heat flux more or less compensates the sensible heat flux in the annual average. Strong evaporation occurs during the snow melt period and particularly during the snow-free period in summer and fall. When the ground is covered by snow, latent heat fluxes through sublimation of snow are recorded, but are insignificant for the average surface energy budget. The near-surface atmospheric stratification is found to be predominantly unstable to neutral, when the ground is snow-free, and stable to neutral for snow-covered ground. Due to long-lasting near-surface inversions in winter, an average temperature difference of approximately 3 K exists between the air temperature at 10 m height and the surface temperature of the snow. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} As such comprehensive data sets are sparse for the Arctic, they are of great value to improve process understanding and support modeling efforts on the present-day and future arctic climate and permafrost conditions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The broad nature of the spectrum is red in both zonal wavenumber and frequency. By removing an estimated background spectrum, numerous statistically significant spectral peaks are isolated. Some of the peaks correspond quite well to the dispersion relations of the equatorially trapped wave modes of shallow water theory with implied equivalent depths in the range of 12\textendash 50 m. Cross-spectrum analysis with the satellite-based microwave sounding unit deep-layer temperature data shows that these spectral peaks in the OLR are ``coupled'' with this dynamical field. The equivalent depths of the convectively coupled waves are shallower than those typical of equatorial waves uncoupled with convection. Such a small equivalent depth is thought to be a result of the interaction between convection and the dynamics.

The central observation is that the growth of vigorous squall lines and severe weather are sharply inhibited at and to the south of the subtropical jet. Thunderstorms do occur south of the subtropical jet but rarely produce severe weather in this synoptic configuration. Speculations are presented which suggest how the subtropical jet might influence divergence, stability and even surface heating to contribute to an environment favorable for severe atoms to the north but unfavorable to the south of the jet axis.},

We evaluate these budgets as represented in 43 CMIP5 climate models with direct observations from both surface and space and identify substantial biases, particularly in the surface fluxes of downward solar and thermal radiation. These flux biases in the various models are then linearly related to their respective land and ocean means to infer best estimates for present day downward solar and thermal radiation over land and oceans. Over land, where most direct observations are available to constrain the surface fluxes, we obtain 184 and 306~Wm-2 for solar and thermal downward radiation, respectively. Over oceans, with weaker observational constraints, corresponding estimates are around 185 and 356~Wm-2. Considering additionally surface albedo and emissivity, we infer a surface absorbed solar and net thermal radiation of 136 and -66~Wm-2 over land, and 170 and -53~Wm-2 over oceans, respectively. The surface net radiation is thus estimated at 70~Wm-2 over land and 117~Wm-2 over oceans, which may impose additional constraints on the poorly known sensible/latent heat flux magnitudes, estimated here near 32/38~Wm-2 over land, and 16/100 Wm-2 over oceans. Estimated uncertainties are on the order of 10 and 5~Wm-2 for most surface and TOA fluxes, respectively. By combining these surface budgets with satellite-determined TOA budgets we quantify the atmospheric energy budgets as residuals (including ocean to land transports), and revisit the global mean energy balance.},

Much less is known about the magnitude of the energy flows within the climate system and at the Earth surface, which cannot be directly measured by satellites. In addition to satellite observations, here we make extensive use of the growing number of surface observations to constrain the global energy balance not only from space, but also from the surface. We combine these observations with the latest modeling efforts performed for the 5th IPCC assessment report to infer best estimates for the global mean surface radiative components. Our analyses favor global mean downward surface solar and thermal radiation values near 185 and 342~Wm-2, respectively, which are most compatible with surface observations. Combined with an estimated surface absorbed solar radiation and thermal emission of 161 and 397~Wm-2, respectively, this leaves 106 Wm-2 of surface net radiation available globally for distribution amongst the non-radiative surface energy balance components. The climate models overestimate the downward solar and underestimate the downward thermal radiation, thereby simulating nevertheless an adequate global mean surface net radiation by error compensation. This also suggests that, globally, the simulated surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, around 20 and 85~Wm-2 on average, state realistic values. The findings of this study are compiled into a new global energy balance diagram, which may be able to reconcile currently disputed inconsistencies between energy and water cycle estimates.},

Here I investigate the representation of the global energy balance in 40 state-of-the-art global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). In the CMIP6 multi-model mean, the magnitudes of the energy balance components are often in better agreement with recent reference estimates compared to earlier model generations on a global mean basis. However, the inter-model spread in the representation of many of the components remains substantial, often on the order of 10\textendash 20 Wm-2 globally, except for aspects of the shortwave clear-sky budgets, which are now more consistently simulated by the CMIP6 models. The substantial inter-model spread in the simulated global mean latent heat fluxes in the CMIP6 models, exceeding 20\% (18~Wm-2), further implies also large discrepancies in their representation of the global water balance. From a historic perspective of model development over the past decades, the largest adjustments in the magnitudes of the simulated present-day global mean energy balance components occurred in the shortwave atmospheric clear-sky absorption and the surface downward longwave radiation. Both components were gradually adjusted upwards over several model generations, on the order of 10 Wm-2, to reach 73 and 344 Wm-2, respectively in the CMIP6 multi-model means. Thereby, CMIP6 has become the first model generation that largely remediates long-standing model deficiencies related to an overestimation in surface downward shortwave and compensational underestimation in downward longwave radiation in its multi-model mean.},

The fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) are generally in good agreement with the satellite data. Larger deviations in simulated cloud forcing are found especially at lower latitudes where the shortwave component within the intertropical convergence zone is overestimated during boreal summer and underestimated in the marine stratocumulus regimes, especially during boreal winter. At the surface the biases in the radiative fluxes are significantly smaller than in earlier versions of the same model and in other GCMs. The shortwave clear-sky fluxes are shown to be in good agreement with newly derived observational estimates. Compared to the preceding model version, ECHAM4, the spurious absorption of solar radiation in the cloudy atmosphere disappears due to the higher resolution in the near-infrared bands of the shortwave radiation code. This reduces the biases with respect to collocated surface and TOA observations. It is illustrated that remaining biases in atmospheric absorption may be related to the crude aerosol climatology, which does not account for high loadings of absorbing aerosol such as from biomass burning, whereas the biases disappear in areas and seasons where aerosol effects are less important. In the longwave, the introduction of the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM) radiation code leads to an increase in the longwave downward flux at the surface at high latitudes, thereby reducing biases typically found in GCMs. The considerable skill in the simulation of the fluxes at the earth's surface underlines the suitability of ECHAM5 as an atmospheric component of an integrated earth system model.},

It is found that the positive-buoyancy contribution to CAPE resulting from the latent heat of fusion more than offsets the negative-buoyancy contribution due to water loading in the reversible thermodynamic process. The departure from moist neutrality in much of the tropical atmosphere exhibits a threshold in boundary-layer wet-bulb potential temperature of 22\textdegree\textendash 23\textdegree C. The corresponding sea surface temperature is approximately 26\textdegree C, close to the empirical threshold for hurricane formation, which suggests that conditional instability plays an important role in the latter phenomenon. The simultaneous presence of finite CAPE and infrequent deep convection in the tropics is tentatively attributed to the convective inhibition energy (CINE) and to the mixing process that destroys positive buoyancy in incipient cloud parcels.},

When the baroclinically unstable zone is moved into low latitudes, however, the equatorward side of the jet can also produce a barotropic instability whose large-scale eddies lead to a strong superrotating westerly current at the equator; the jet remains close to its axisymmetric location. For the earth, the transition between these two regimes occurs when the jet lies close to 30\textdegree, according to calculations with a global, multilevel, spectral, primitive equation model that examines superrotating flows for a wide range of rotation rates. The existence of a stable superrotating regime implies that an alternative climate could occur, but only under novel conditions.},

  abstract = {We present a method to attribute cloud radiative feedbacks to convective processes, using subcloud layer buoyancy as a diagnostic of stable and deep convective regimes. Applying this approach to tropical remote sensing measurements over years 2000\textendash 2016 shows that an inferred negative short-term cloud feedback from deep convection was nearly offset by a positive cloud feedback from stable regimes. The net cloud feedback was within statistical uncertainty of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) with historical forcings, with discrepancies in the partitioning of the cloud feedback into convective regimes. Compensation between high-cloud responses to tropics-wide warming in stable and unstable regimes resulted in smaller net changes in high-cloud fraction with warming. In addition, deep convection and associated high clouds set in at warmer temperatures in response to warming, as a consequence of nearly invariant subcloud buoyancy. This invariance further constrained the magnitude of cloud radiative feedbacks and is consistent with climate model projections.},

  abstract = {Aircraft do not fly through a vacuum, but through an atmosphere whose meteorological characteristics are changing because of global warming. The impacts of aviation on climate change have long been recognised, but the impacts of climate change on aviation have only recently begun to emerge. These impacts include intensified turbulence and increased take-off weight restrictions. Here we investigate the influence of climate change on flight routes and journey times. We feed synthetic atmospheric wind fields generated from climate model simulations into a routing algorithm of the type used operationally by flight planners. We focus on transatlantic flights between London and New York, and how they change when the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is doubled. We find that a strengthening of the prevailing jet-stream winds causes eastbound flights to significantly shorten and westbound flights to significantly lengthen in all seasons. Eastbound and westbound crossings in winter become approximately twice as likely to take under 5 h 20 min and over 7 h 00 min, respectively. For reasons that are explained using a conceptual model, the eastbound shortening and westbound lengthening do not cancel out, causing round-trip journey times to increase. Even assuming no future growth in aviation, the extrapolation of our results to all transatlantic traffic suggests that aircraft will collectively be airborne for an extra 2000 h each year, burning an extra 7.2 million gallons of jet fuel at a cost of US\$ 22 million, and emitting an extra 70 million kg of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of 7100 average British homes. Our results provide further evidence of the two-way interaction between aviation and climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract The control of atmospheric storm tracks by ocean dynamics, orography, and their interaction is investigated using idealized experiments with a simplified coupled atmosphere\textendash ocean climate model. The study focuses on the quasi\textendash steady state for the storm tracks in the Northern Hemisphere winter mean. The experiments start with a background state without mountains and ocean dynamics, and in separate stages include orography and a dynamic ocean to obtain a more realistic control simulation. The separate effects of ocean dynamics, orography, and their nonlinear interaction are identified for the storm tracks and the surface thermodynamic forcing over the ocean. The model study suggests that atmospheric storm tracks are a robust feature of the climate system, occurring at midlatitudes even if there is no orographic forcing or ocean heat transport. Ocean dynamics generally lead to a poleward shift in both the storm track and the maximum in atmospheric northward heat transport and induce a northeastward tilt over the Atlantic. This poleward shift is linked to the extra heat transport by the ocean and the tightening of sea surface temperature gradients on the western side of ocean basins. Orographic forcing causes along-track variability with a weakening of the storm track over the continents and induces a northeastward tilt over the western Pacific, which is associated with a stationary planetary wave train generated by the Tibetan Plateau. The interaction between ocean dynamics and orographic forcing plays a localized role, enhancing the contrast between the Atlantic and Pacific. Much of the response to the forcing is eddy mediated and transient eddies help to spread the influence of orographic and ocean forcing.},

RCE is an idealization of the climate system in which there is a~balance between radiative cooling of the atmosphere and heating by convection. The scientific objectives of RCEMIP are three-fold. First, clouds and climate sensitivity will be investigated in the RCE setting. This includes determining how cloud fraction changes with warming and the role of self-aggregation of convection in climate sensitivity. Second, RCEMIP will quantify the dependence of the degree of convective aggregation and tropical circulation regimes on temperature. Finally, by providing a common baseline, RCEMIP will allow the robustness of the RCE state across the spectrum of models to be assessed, which is essential for interpreting the results found regarding clouds, climate sensitivity, and aggregation, and more generally, determining which features of tropical climate a RCE framework is useful for. A novel aspect and major advantage of RCEMIP is the accessibility of the RCE framework to a variety of models, including cloud-resolving models, general circulation models, global cloud-resolving models, single-column models, and large-eddy simulation models.},

One mode of organization that is found in idealized numerical modelling simulations is self-aggregation, a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed convection to organized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. We explore the influence of domain geometry on the mechanisms, growth rates and length-scales of self-aggregation of tropical convection. We simulate radiative\textendash convective equilibrium with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), in a non-rotating, highly elongated three-dimensional (3D) channel domain of length {$>$}104 km, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea-surface temperature varying from 280\textendash 310 K. Convection self-aggregates into multiple moist and dry bands across this full range of temperatures. As convection aggregates, we find a decrease in upper tropospheric cloud fraction but an increase in lower tropospheric cloud fraction; this sensitivity of clouds to aggregation agrees with observations in the upper troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. An advantage of the channel geometry is that a separation distance between convectively active regions can be defined; we present a theory for this distance based on boundary layer. We find that surface fluxes and radiative heating act as positive feedback mechanisms, favouring self-aggregation, but advection of moist static energy acts as a negative feedback, opposing self-aggregation, for nearly all temperatures and times. Early in the process of self-aggregation, surface fluxes are a positive feedback at all temperatures, shortwave radiation is a strong positive feedback at low surface temperatures but weakens at higher temperatures and longwave radiation is a negative feedback at low temperatures but becomes a positive feedback for temperatures greater than 295\textendash 300 K. Clouds contribute strongly to the radiative feedback, especially at low temperatures.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Paleocene\textendash Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; 55 Ma) is of particular interest since it is regarded as a suitable analog to future climate change. In this study, the PETM climate is investigated using the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3) with atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 4\texttimes, 8\texttimes, and 16\texttimes{} the preindustrial value. Simulated climate change from 4\texttimes{} to 8\texttimes{} atmospheric CO2 concentration, possibly corresponding to an environmental precursor of the PETM event, leads to a warming of the North Atlantic Ocean Intermediate-Water masses, thus lowering the critical depth for methane hydrate destabilization by {$\sim$}500 m. A further increase from 8\texttimes{} to 16\texttimes CO2, analogous to a possible massive methane hydrate release, results in global oceanic warming and stratification. The increase in the radiative surface warming, especially at high latitudes, is partially offset by a decrease in the ocean heat transport due to a reduced overturning circulation. Surface temperature values simulated in the 16\texttimes CO2 PETM run represent the closest match to surface temperature reconstructions from proxies for this period. Simulated PETM precipitation, characterized by a slight northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, increases at higher CO2 concentrations, especially for the northern midlatitudes as well as the high latitudes in both hemispheres. Data-inferred precipitation values and gradients for North America and Spain, for instance, are in good agreement with the 16\texttimes CO2 simulation. Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations might also have favored the release of terrestrial methane through warmer and wetter conditions over land, thus reinforcing the greenhouse gas concentration increase.},

In addition to the four standard shortwave flux diagnostics (upward, downward, surface, and top of atmosphere), the technique makes use of surface-down and top-up fluxes over a zero-albedo surface obtained from an auxiliary online shortwave calculation. The simple model optical properties, when constructed from the time-mean fluxes, are effective optical properties, useful for predicting the time-mean response to optical property changes. The technique is tested against auxiliary online shortwave calculations at four validation albedos and shown to predict the monthly mean surface absorption with an rms error of less than 2\% over the globe. The reasons for the accuracy of the technique are explored. Less accurate techniques that make use of existing shortwave diagnostics are presented and compared.},

Seasonal prediction of the sea ice cover along these routes could support the increasing summertime ship traffic taking advantage of recent low ice conditions. We introduce the minimum Arctic sea ice path (MIP) between Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as a shipping-relevant metric amenable to multidecadal hindcast evaluation. We show, using 1992-2017 retrospective predictions, that bias correction is necessary for the GFDL SPEAR forecast system to improve upon damped persistence seasonal forecasts of summertime daily MIP between Atlantic and Pacific Oceans both east and west of Greenland, corresponding roughly to the Northeast and Northwest Passages. Without bias correction, only the NE MIP forecasts have lower error than a damped persistence forecast. Using the forecast ensemble spread to estimate a lower bound on forecast error, we find large opportunities for forecast error reduction, especially at lead-times less than two months. Most of the potential improvement remains after linear removal of climatological and trend biases, suggesting significant error reduction might come from improved initialization and simulation of sub-annual variability. Using a different passive microwave sea ice dataset for calculating error than was used for data assimilation increases the raw forecast errors but not trend anomaly forecast errors.},

In the spirit of Hansen et al. an efficacy factor is applied to the ocean heat uptake. Comparing the time evolution of the surface warming in high and low efficacy models demonstrates the role of this efficacy in the transient response to CO2 forcing. Abrupt CO2 increase experiments show that the large efficacy of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's Climate Model version 2.1 (CM2.1) sets up in the first two decades following the increase in forcing. The use of an efficacy is necessary to fit this model's global mean temperature evolution in periods with both increasing and stable forcing. The intermodel correlation of transient climate response with ocean heat uptake efficacy is greater than its correlation with equilibrium climate sensitivity in an ensemble of climate models used for the third and fourth Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments. When computed at the time of doubling in the standard experiment with 1\% yr-1 increase in CO2, the efficacy is variable amongst the models but is generally greater than 1, averages between 1.3 and 1.4, and is as large as 1.75 in several models.},

Here we use a three-dimensional climate system model to study the effects of increasing CO2 on Earth's climate, across many orders of magnitude of variation, and under solar inputs relevant for paleo, present, and future Earth scenarios. We find that the change in global mean surface temperature from doubling CO2 (i.e., the equilibrium climate sensitivity) may vary between 2.6 and 21.6 K over the course of Earth's history. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the adjusted radiative forcing from doubling CO2 increases at high concentrations up to about 1.5 bars partial pressure, generally resulting in larger changes in the surface temperature. We also find that the cloud albedo feedback causes an abrupt transition in climate for warming atmospheres that depends both on the mean surface temperature and the total solar insolation.

As the Sun brightens due to stellar evolution, Earth will become uninhabitable due to rising temperatures. Here we use a modified version of the Community Earth System Model from the National Center for Atmospheric Research to study Earth under intense solar radiation. For small ({$\leq$}10\%) increases in the solar constant (S0), Earth warms nearly linearly with climate sensitivities of 1 K/(W m-2) and global mean surface temperatures below 310 K. However, an abrupt shift in climate is found as the solar constant is increased to +12.5\% S0. Here climate sensitivity peaks at 6.5 K/(W m-2), while global mean surface temperatures rise above 330 K. This climatic transition is associated with a fundamental change to the radiative-convective state of the atmosphere. Hot, moist climates feature both strong solar absorption and inefficient radiative cooling in the low atmosphere, thus yielding net radiative heating of the near-surface layers. This heating forms an inversion that effectively shuts off convection in the boundary layer. Beyond the transition, Earth continues to warm but with climate sensitivities again near unity. Conditions conducive to significant water loss to space are not found until +19\% S0. Earth remains stable against a thermal runaway up to at least +21\% S0, but at that point, global mean surface temperatures exceed 360 K, and water loss to space becomes rapid. Water loss of the oceans from a moist greenhouse may preclude a thermal runaway.},

The LTS can be regarded as a measure of the strength of the inversion that caps the planetary boundary layer (PBL). A stronger inversion is more effective at trapping moisture within the marine boundary layer (MBL), permitting greater cloud cover. This paper presents a new formulation, called the {$<$}em{$>$}estimated inversion strength{$<$}/em{$>$} (EIS), to estimate the strength of the PBL inversion given the temperatures at 700 hPa and at the surface. The EIS accounts for the general observation that the free-tropospheric temperature profile is often close to a moist adiabat and its lapse rate is strongly temperature dependent. Therefore, for a given LTS, the EIS is greater at colder temperatures. It is demonstrated that while the seasonal cycles of LTS and low cloud cover fraction (CF) are strongly correlated in many regions, no single relationship between LTS and CF can be found that encompasses the wide range of temperatures occurring in the Tropics, subtropics, and midlatitudes. However, a single linear relationship between CF and EIS explains 83\% of the regional/seasonal variance in stratus cloud amount, suggesting that EIS is a more regime-independent predictor of stratus cloud amount than is LTS under a wide range of climatological conditions.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The result has some potentially important implications for how low clouds might behave in a changed climate. In contrast to Miller's thermostat hypothesis that a reduction in the lapse rate (Clausius\textendash Clapeyron) will lead to increased LTS and increased tropical low cloud cover in a warmer climate, the results here suggest that low clouds may be much less sensitive to changes in the temperature profile if the vertical profile of tropospheric warming follows a moist adiabat.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

It is found that the vertical structure of the warming associated with moist intrusions is bottom amplified, corresponding to a transition of local conditions from a ``cold clear'' state with a strong inversion to a ``warm opaque'' state with a weaker inversion. In the marginal sea ice zone of the Barents Sea, the passage of an intrusion also causes a retreat of the ice margin, which persists for many days after the intrusion has passed. The authors find that there is a positive trend in the number of intrusion events crossing 70\textdegree N during December and January that can explain roughly 45\% of the surface air temperature and 30\% of the sea ice concentration trends observed in the Barents Sea during the past two decades.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

These events lead to synoptic situations similar to midlatitude blocking that are referred to as high-latitude blocking episodes. A positive NAO is envisaged as being a description of periods in which these episodes are infrequent and can be considered as a basic, unblocked situation. A negative NAO is a description of periods in which episodes occur frequently. A similar, but weaker, relationship exists between wave breaking over the Pacific and the west Pacific pattern. Evidence is given to support this hypothesis by using a two-dimensional potential-vorticity-based index to identify wave breaking at various latitudes. This is applied to Northern Hemisphere winter data from the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), and the events identified are then related to the NAO. Certain dynamical precursors are identified that appear to increase the likelihood of wave breaking. These suggest mechanisms by which variability in the tropical Pacific, and in the stratosphere, could affect the NAO.},

Jet stream changes are analyzed both using a direct measure of the near-surface westerly wind maximum and using an EOF-based approach. This allows jet stream changes to be related to the widely used leading patterns of variability: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic (EA) pattern. Viewed in NAO\textendash EA state space, isolines of jet latitude and speed resemble a distorted polar coordinate system, highlighting the dependence of the jet stream quantities on both spatial patterns. Some differences in the results of the two methods are discussed, but both approaches agree on the general characteristics of the climate models. While there is some agreement between models on a poleward shift of the jet stream in response to anthropogenic forcing, there is still considerable spread between different model projections, especially in winter. Furthermore, the model responses to forcing are often weaker than their biases when compared to a reanalysis. Diagnoses of jet stream changes can be sensitive to the methodologies used, and several aspects of this are also discussed.},

We focus on the North Atlantic winter season in the ERA-40 reanalysis. Diagnostics of the latitude and speed of the eddy-driven jet stream are compared with conventional diagnostics of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the East Atlantic (EA) pattern. This shows that the NAO and the EA both describe combined changes in the latitude and speed of the jet stream. It is therefore necessary, but not always sufficient, to consider both the NAO and the EA in identifying changes in the jet stream. The jet stream analysis suggests that there are three preferred latitudinal positions of the North Atlantic eddy-driven jet stream in winter. This result is in very good agreement with the application of a statistical mixture model to the two-dimensional state space defined by the NAO and the EA. These results are consistent with several other studies which identify four European/Atlantic regimes, comprising three jet stream patterns plus European blocking events.

Precipitation shows strong surface variations, with high rates around Hellas basin and west of Tharsis but low rates around Margaritifer Sinus (where the observed valley network drainage density is nonetheless high). In the cold and icy scenario, snow migration is a function of both obliquity and surface pressure, and limited episodic melting is possible through combinations of seasonal, volcanic, and impact forcing. At surface pressures above those required to avoid atmospheric collapse ({$\sim$}0.5 bar) and moderate to high obliquity, snow is transported to the equatorial highland regions where the concentration of valley networks is highest. Snow accumulation in the Aeolis quadrangle is high, indicating an ice-free northern ocean is not required to supply water to Gale crater. At lower surface pressures and obliquities, both H2O and CO2 are trapped as ice at the poles and the equatorial regions become extremely dry. The valley network distribution is positively correlated with snow accumulation produced by the cold and icy simulation at 41.8{$\circ$} obliquity but uncorrelated with precipitation produced by the warm and wet simulation.

Here we present a range of calculations we performed to study the dependence of water loss rates from terrestrial planets on a range of atmospheric and external parameters. We show that CO2 can only cause significant water loss by increasing surface temperatures over a narrow range of conditions, with cooling of the middle and upper atmosphere acting as a bottleneck on escape in other circumstances. Around G-stars, efficient loss only occurs on planets with intermediate CO2 atmospheric partial pressures (0.1\textendash 1 bar) that receive a net flux close to the critical runaway greenhouse limit. Because G-star total luminosity increases with time but X-ray and ultraviolet/ultravoilet luminosity decreases, this places strong limits on water loss for planets like Earth. In contrast, for a CO2-rich early Venus, diffusion limits on water loss are only important if clouds caused strong cooling, implying that scenarios where the planet never had surface liquid water are indeed plausible. Around M-stars, water loss is primarily a function of orbital distance, with planets that absorb less flux than {$\sim$}270 W m-2 (global mean) unlikely to lose more than one Earth ocean of H2O over their lifetimes unless they lose all their atmospheric N2/CO2 early on. Because of the variability of H2O delivery during accretion, our results suggest that many ``Earth-like'' exoplanets in the habitable zone may have ocean-covered surfaces, stable CO2/H2O-rich atmospheres, and high mean surface temperatures.},

Convective- wale downdrafts act to cool and moisten the lower troposphere in the midlatitudes as in the tropics.

Using a Gaussian approximation for the distribution of equivalent potential temperature, the authors argue that the tropopause potential temperature is approximately given by the mean equivalent potential temperature at the surface plus twice its standard derivation. This relationship is motivated by the comparison of the meridional circulation on dry and moist isentropes. It is further tested using four reanalysis datasets: the Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim); the NCEP\textendash Department of Energy (DOE) Reanalysis II; the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis; and the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR), version 2. The proposed relationship successfully captures the annual cycle of the tropopause for both hemispheres. The results are robust among different reanalysis datasets, albeit the 20CR tends to overestimate the tropopause potential temperature. Furthermore, the proposed mechanism also works well in obtaining the interannual variability (with climatological annual cycle removed) for Northern Hemisphere summer with an above-0.6 correlation across different reanalyses. On the contrary, this mechanism is rather weak in explaining the interannual variability in the Southern Hemisphere and no longer works for Northern Hemisphere wintertime.

  abstract = {This paper investigates the reversibility of CO2 induced climate change and in particular the potential impacts of different rates of CO2 reduction using a coupled climate model. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is ramped up by 0.5~\%/year from the preindustrial value to 4\texttimes CO2 and then ramped down from 2\texttimes CO2 to 4\texttimes CO2 with different rates. How the response of the climate system is affected by the peak atmospheric CO2 concentration and the rate of long term decline is vital information for those considering hypothetical geoengineering options to remove CO2. Major components of the climate system including global mean surface air temperature and precipitation, contribution of thermal expansion to global sea level rise, loss of the Arctic sea ice, weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and the South Asia monsoon are analyzed. We have found no `tipping points' or thresholds beyond which CO2 induced climate change in these components become irreversible within this model under the specific scenarios. However, there are strong inertias and path-dependent hysteresis in the climate system linked through oceanic memory. Initially the strengthened global hydrological cycle accelerates further in response to a CO2 ramp-down before weakening. Thermal expansion of the oceans continues for many decades after CO2 concentration starts to decrease. A 0.5~\%/year reduction from 4\texttimes CO2 could see a further 25~\% sea level rise. The weakening of the AMOC is reversible, but the build-up of highly saline subtropical waters during global warming drives an overshoot of the AMOC after the CO2 ramp-down and extends the warming of the northern high latitudes by many decades. The South Asia monsoon strengthens in response to a CO2 ramp-up marked by an increase in summer monsoon rainfall. This increase reverses rapidly following a CO2 ramp-down, displaying an undershoot in monsoon rainfall for rapid CO2 reductions.},

  abstract = {Eight atmospheric regional climate models (RCMs) were run for the period September 1997 to October 1998 over the western Arctic Ocean. This period was coincident with the observational campaign of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) project. The RCMs shared common domains, centred on the SHEBA observation camp, along with a common model horizontal resolution, but differed in their vertical structure and physical parameterizations. All RCMs used the same lateral and surface boundary conditions. Surface downwelling solar and terrestrial radiation, surface albedo, vertically integrated water vapour, liquid water path and cloud cover from each model are evaluated against the SHEBA observation data. Downwelling surface radiation, vertically integrated water vapour and liquid water path are reasonably well simulated at monthly and daily timescales in the model ensemble mean, but with considerable differences among individual models. Simulated surface albedos are relatively accurate in the winter season, but become increasingly inaccurate and variable in the melt season, thereby compromising the net surface radiation budget. Simulated cloud cover is more or less uncorrelated with observed values at the daily timescale. Even for monthly averages, many models do not reproduce the annual cycle correctly. The inter-model spread of simulated cloud-cover is very large, with no model appearing systematically superior. Analysis of the co-variability of terms controlling the surface radiation budget reveal some of the key processes requiring improved treatment in Arctic RCMs. Improvements in the parameterization of cloud amounts and surface albedo are most urgently needed to improve the overall performance of RCMs in the Arctic.},

Results from ten CRMs are also used to diagnose problems in the SCMs. It is shown that most SCMs can generally capture well the convective events that were well-developed within the SCM domain, while most of them have difficulties in simulating the occurrence of those convective events that only occurred within a small part of the domain. All models significantly underestimate the surface stratiform precipitation. A third of them produce large errors in surface precipitation and thermodynamic structures. Deficiencies in convective triggering mechanisms are thought to be one of the major reasons. Using a triggering mechanism that is based on the vertical integral of parcel buoyant energy without additional appropriate constraints results in overactive convection, which in turn leads to large systematic warm/dry biases in the troposphere. It is also shown that a non-penetrative convection scheme can underestimate the depth of instability for midlatitude convection, which leads to large systematic cold/moist biases in the troposphere. SCMs agree well quantitatively with CRMs in the updraught mass fluxes, while most models significantly underestimate the downdraught mass fluxes. Neglect of mesoscale updraught and downdraught mass fluxes in the SCMs contributes considerably to the discrepancies between the SCMs and the CRMs. In addition, uncertainties in the diagnosed mass fluxes in the CRMs and deficiencies with cumulus parametrizations are not negligible. Similar results are obtained in the sensitivity tests when different forcing approaches are used. Finally, sensitivity tests from an SCM indicate that its simulations can be greatly improved when its triggering mechanism and closure assumption are improved. \textcopyright{} Royal Meteorological Society, 2002.

The results show that ECMWF forecasts of Arctic SIT are more skillful than persistence forecast (PFs) during the transition seasons for lead times longer than 30 days, indicating the advantages of dynamical prediction. However, ECMWF suffers from large initial SIT errors and has lower skill than a PF, especially from March to June. Thus, subseasonal Arctic SIT predictions still face many challenges, and improving the mean SIT in the model and assimilating satellite-estimated SIT in the ocean analysis would significantly improve SIT forecasts.},

During an average year between 2005 and 2018, the highest (lowest) temperature in the lower troposphere was approximately -25 \textdegree C (-60 \textdegree C) in December (July) at a height of about 500 m above the surface (at the surface). A temperature inversion layer above the surface was found during the whole year but was weaker during the summer, while the inversion layers at the tropopause (about 8 km amsl) mostly disappeared during spring and winter. General warming trends were found at all heights and months, but in a few heights and months cooling trends still occurred (e.g., in September below 7 km amsl). Nevertheless, seasonal and yearly averaged temperatures all presented warming trends: 1.1, 1.3, 0.6, 1.5 and 1.1 \textdegree C/decade at the surface, and 0.7, 1.0, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.6 \textdegree C/decade for the layer average from the surface to 10 km amsl, for spring, summer, autumn, winter, and yearly average, respectively. Most of the water vapor was confined in the lowermost 3 km of the atmosphere with a maximum of 0.35 g kg-1 in December at a 200 m height above surface, and the specific humidity had the similar characteristic of annual cycle and inversion layers as the temperature. At heights below 5 km amsl, increasing trends of specific humidity larger than 0.02 g kg-1/decade occurred during summer months, including the late spring and early autumn, and the annual mean showed an increasing trend of about 0.01\textendash 0.02 g kg-1/decade. Meanwhile, above 5 km amsl, the trends became small and generally less than 0.02 g kg-1/decade in all the months, and beyond 7 km amsl the specific humidity remained almost invariant due to its small moisture content as compared with lower levels. From the surface to 10 km amsl, the specific humidity averaged trends of 0.0062, 0.019, 0.0013, 0.002 and 0.007 g kg-1/decade for spring, summer, autumn, winter and yearly average, respectively.},

Parcels lifted from the top of the subcloud layer are more nearly neutral than those originating near the surface, and atmospheres with higher levels of free convection (LFCs) are closer to neutral than those with low LFCs.

Under the condition that zonally uniform solar heating is used, the meridional circulation is dominated by a single cell in a whole atmosphere, and the superrotation with velocities faster than 100 m s\textendash 1 is formed near 60-km altitude. The meridional circulation effectively pumps up angular momentum from the lower to the middle atmosphere. Then the angular momentum is transported by poleward flows of the meridional circulation, and a part of the transported momentum is returned back to the low-latitudinal regions by waves. As a result, the simulated superrotation is formed by the Gierasch mechanism. Equatorward angular momentum flux required in the Gierasch mechanism is caused by not only barotropic waves but also various waves. Rossby, mixed Rossby\textendash gravity, and gravity waves transport the angular momentum equatorward. Although vertically propagating gravity waves decelerate the superrotation above 70 km, the fully developed superrotation can be maintained in the cloud layer (45\textendash 70 km).},

A number of previous studies have reported polar low formation over the Sea of Japan within the East Asian winter monsoon. To understand the climatology of polar lows over the Sea of Japan, a tracking algorithm for polar lows is applied to the recent JRA-55 reanalysis. The polar low tracking is applied to 36 cold seasons (October\textendash March) from October 1979 to March 2015. The polar lows over the Sea of Japan reach their maximum intensity on the southeastern side of the midline between the Japanese islands and the Asian continent. Consistent with previous case studies, composite analysis demonstrates that the polar low development is associated with the enhanced northerly flow on the western side of a synoptic-scale extratropical cyclone, with the cold trough in the midtroposphere and with increased heat fluxes from the sea surface. Furthermore, the present climatological study has revealed two dominant directions of motion of the polar lows: southward and eastward. Southward-moving polar lows are steered by a strong northerly flow in the lower troposphere, which is enhanced on the western side of synoptic-scale extratropical cyclones, while the eastward-moving polar lows occur within a planetary-scale westerly flow in the midlatitudes. Thus, the direction of polar low motion reflects the difference in planetary- and synoptic-scale conditions.},

The global historical record has been extensively examined, but it is short and plagued with recurring questions about its homogeneity, limiting its effectiveness at assessing how TCs vary with climate. Past warm intervals provide an opportunity to quantify TC behavior in a warmer-than-present world. Here, we use a TC-resolving ({$\sim$}25 km) global atmospheric model to investigate TC activity during the mid-Pliocene warm period (3.264-3.025 Ma) that shares similarities with projections of future climate. Two experiments, one driven by the reconstructed sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the other by the SSTs from an ensemble of mid-Pliocene simulations, consistently predict enhanced global-average peak TC intensity during the mid-Pliocene coupled with longer duration, increased power dissipation, and a poleward migration of the location of peak intensity. The simulations are similar to global TC changes observed during recent global warming, as well as those of many future projections, providing a window into the potential TC activity that may be expected in a warmer world. Changes to power dissipation and TC frequency, especially in the Pacific, are sensitive to the different SST patterns, which could affect the viability of the role of TCs as a factor for maintaining a reduced zonal SST gradient during the Pliocene, as recently hypothesized.},

The wave activity flux provides insight into the simulation of nondynamic as well as dynamic processes in these models. Model performances for current climate simulations are evaluated with respect to NMC analyses averaged over 1978\textendash 1990. The models fare best when the stationary wave forcing is strongest, that is, in the wintertime Northern Hemisphere, where they reproduce the observed three-branch structure of upward wave activity flux. For the Northern Hemisphere summer and the Southern Hemisphere in both summer and winter, the models show less agreement with observations, although they do simulate the generally downward flux observed during Northern Hemisphere summer, which the analysis suggests is caused by convection. C02-doubling changes in the wave activity flux show little consistency between the two models. The analysis suggests that accurate modeling of stationary wave activity flux is strongly dependent on diabatic forcing, especially that occurring in storm tracks. Improving the simulation of stationary wave activity forcing requires a much better understanding of the physics governing storm tracks and latent heat release in the atmosphere, so that improvements in stationary wave simulation in these models will not occur by simply increasing model resolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract The molar mass of water vapor is much less than that of dry air. This makes a moist parcel lighter than a dry parcel of the same temperature and pressure. This effect is referred to as the vapor buoyancy effect and has often been overlooked in climate studies. We propose that the vapor buoyancy effect increases Earth's outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and that this negative radiative effect increases with warming, stabilizing Earth's climate. We illustrate this mechanism in an idealized tropical atmosphere, where there is no horizontal buoyancy gradient in the free troposphere. Temperature increases toward dry atmosphere columns to compensate the reduced vapor buoyancy, increasing OLR by O(1 W m-2) at the reference climate. In warmer climates, the temperature difference between moist and dry columns would increase as a result of increasing atmospheric water vapor, leading to enhanced radiative effect and thereby stabilizing Earth's climate. We estimate that this feedback strength is about O(0.2 W m-2 K-1) in the idealized atmosphere, which compares to cloud feedback and surface albedo feedback in the current climate. We further show evidence from observations and real-gas radiative transfer calculations for a significant radiative effect of vapor buoyancy in the tropical atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Abstract The authors have explored the factors governing upper-tropospheric relative humidity with a simple model based on isentropic mixing and condensation. Our analysis has focused on the Northern Hemisphere winter season and on the 315-K (dry) isentropic surface. The advection\textendash condensation model yields the following results. In the absence of moisture resupply, about half of the mass of water is lost from the isentropic surface after only 10 days, with the main brake on drying being the weak mixing between Tropics and extratropics. The moist plumes escaping from the Tropics take the form of filamentary structures, which are more numerous and space filling in the summer/Southern Hemisphere than in the winter/Northern Hemisphere. These moist plumes are accompanied by substantial importation of extratropical dry air into the Tropics. The probability distributions of midlatitude relative humidity are bimodal, with a prominent dry peak having a lognormal tail and a spike representing saturated air; the summer hemisphere has generally higher relative humidity than the winter hemisphere. When moisture is maintained by periodically resaturating the Tropics, the resulting cloud and moisture fields exhibit a fractal character, with a tendency to become less space filling with distance from the Tropics. Some tentative comparisons with data are made, which tend to confirm the advective control of relative humidity patterns outside the Tropics. There are indications, however, that the advection-condensation model with moisture resupply only from the Tropics yields an upper troposphere that is far too dry. The authors suggest that the missing moisture is supplied from the 295-K isentropic surface via diabatic mixing arising in ascending, convecting saturated trajectories near that surface. As found in earlier passive tracer studies, the permeable mixing barrier between the Tropics and extratropics has the potential to exert a controlling influence on the global climate.},

It is hypothesized that the inadequate treatment of MCSs is responsible for the longstanding warm and dry bias over the central US in coarse-resolution general circulation model (GCM) simulations. In particular, a better understanding of MCS initiation is still lacking. Here a single-column Lagrangian parcel model is first developed to simulate the basic features of a rising parcel. This simple model demonstrates the collective effects of boundary layer moistening and dynamical lifting in triggering convective initiation and reproduces successfully its early afternoon peak with surface equivalent potential temperature as a controlling factor. It also predicts that convection is harder to trigger in the future climate under global warming, consistent with the results from convection-permitting regional climate simulations. Then a multi-column model that includes an array of single-column models aligned in the east-west direction and incorporates idealized cold pool interaction mechanisms is developed. The multi-column model captures readily the cold pool induced upscale growth feature in MCS genesis from initially scattered convection that is organized into a mesoscale cluster in a few hours. It also highlights the crucial role of lifting effects due to cold pool collision and spreading, subsidence effect, and gust front propagation speed in controlling the final size of mesoscale clusters and cold pool regions. This simple model should be useful for understanding fundamental mechanisms of MCS initiation and providing guidance for improving MCS simulations in GCMs.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, empirical experiences from operational implementation efforts suggest that its strict application does not work well. The purpose of the present paper is to explain mathematically why this closure does not work in practice, and to suggest that problems stem from physically unrealistic assumptions. For this purpose, the closure hypothesis is examined in its original form, and without imposing a condition of a positiveness to the convective mass fluxes. The Jordan sounding with idealized large-scale forcing is used for diagnosis purposes. The question is addressed from several perspectives including the completeness of the entraining-plume spectrum, and a singular vector decomposition of the interaction kernel matrix. The main problems with the quasi-equilibrium closure are traced to (i) the relatively slow response of shallower convective modes to large-scale forcing and (ii) detrainment at convection top producing strong cooling and moistening. A strict application of the convective quasi-equilibrium principle leads to a singular response of shallow convection. An explicit coupling of convection with stratiform clouds would be crucial for preventing this unrealistic behavior, recognizing that the reevaporation of detrained cloudy air is a relatively slow process.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {It is well known that the Arctic warms much more than the rest of the world even under spatially quasi-uniform radiative forcing such as that due to an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. While the surface albedo feedback is often referred to as the explanation of the enhanced Arctic warming, the importance of atmospheric heat transport from the lower latitudes has also been reported in previous studies. In the current study, an attempt is made to understand how the regional feedbacks in the Arctic are induced by the change in atmospheric heat transport and vice versa. Equilibrium sensitivity experiments that enable us to separate the contributions of the Northern Hemisphere mid-high latitude response to the CO2 increase and the remote influence of surface warming in other regions are carried out. The result shows that the effect of remote forcing is predominant in the Arctic warming. The dry-static energy transport to the Arctic is reduced once the Arctic surface warms in response to the local or remote forcing. The feedback analysis based on the energy budget reveals that the increased moisture transport from lower latitudes, on the other hand, warms the Arctic in winter more effectively not only via latent heat release but also via greenhouse effect of water vapor and clouds. The change in total atmospheric heat transport determined as a result of counteracting dry-static and latent heat components, therefore, is not a reliable measure for the net effect of atmospheric dynamics on the Arctic warming. The current numerical experiments support a recent interpretation based on the regression analysis: the concurrent reduction in the atmospheric poleward heat transport and future Arctic warming predicted in some models does not imply a minor role of the atmospheric dynamics. Despite the similar magnitude of poleward heat transport change, the Arctic warms more than the Southern Ocean even in the equilibrium response without ocean dynamics. It is shown that a large negative shortwave cloud feedback over the Southern Ocean, greatly influenced by low-latitude surface warming, is responsible for this asymmetric polar warming.},

A constant cloud anvil temperature, due to increased anvil altitude, has been argued to lead to a ``zero cloud emission change'' feedback, which can be considered positive relative to the negative feedback associated with cloud anvil warming when cloud altitude is unchanged. Here, partial radiative perturbation (PRP) analysis is used to quantify the radiative feedback caused by clouds that follow the FAT theory (FAT\textendash cloud feedback) and to set this in the context of other feedback components in two atmospheric general circulation models. The FAT\textendash cloud feedback is positive in the PRP framework due to increasing anvil altitude, but because the cloud emission does not change, this positive feedback is cancelled by an equal and opposite component of the temperature feedback due to increasing emission from the cloud. To incorporate this cancellation, the thermal radiative damping with fixed relative humidity and anvil temperature (T-FRAT) decomposition framework is proposed for longwave feedbacks, in which temperature, fixed relative humidity, and FAT\textendash cloud feedbacks are combined. In T-FRAT, the cloud feedback under the FAT constraint is zero, while that under the proportionately higher anvil temperature (PHAT) constraint is negative. The change in the observable cloud radiative effect with FAT\textendash cloud response is also evaluated and shown to be negative due to so-called cloud masking effects. It is shown that ``cloud masking'' is a misleading term in this context, and these effects are interpreted more generally as ``cloud climatology effects.''{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

The analysis shows that WaMAIs, fueled by Arctic blocking, cause a relative surface warming and hence a sea-ice reduction by exerting positive anomalies of net thermal irradiances and turbulent fluxes on the surface. Over Arctic Ocean sectors with land-locked sea ice in winter, such as Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Sea, and Beaufort Sea, the total surface energy-budget is dominated by net thermal irradiance. From a Lagrangian perspective, total water path (TWP) increases linearly with the downstream distance from the sea-ice edge over the completely ice-covered sectors, inducing almost linearly increasing net thermal irradiance and total surface energy-budget. However, over the Barents Sea, with an open ocean to the south, total net surface energy-budget is dominated by the surface turbulent flux. With the energy in the warm-and-moist air continuously transported to the surface, net surface turbulent flux gradually decreases with distance, especially within the first 2\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} north of the ice edge, inducing a decreasing but still positive total surface energy-budget. The boundary-layer energy-budget patterns over the Barents Sea can be categorized into three classes: radiation-dominated, turbulence-dominated, and turbulence-dominated with cold dome, comprising about 52 \%, 40 \%, and 8 \% of all WaMAIs, respectively. Statistically, turbulence-dominated cases with or without cold dome occur along with 1 order of magnitude larger large-scale subsidence than the radiation-dominated cases. For the turbulence-dominated category, larger turbulent fluxes are exerted to the surface, probably because of stronger wind shear. In radiation-dominated WaMAIs, stratocumulus develops more strongly and triggers intensive cloud-top radiative cooling and related buoyant mixing that extends from cloud top to the surface, inducing a thicker well-mixed layer under the cloud. With the existence of cold dome, fewer liquid water clouds were formed, and less or even negative turbulent fluxes could reach the surface.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Aridity Index (AI) indicates the balance between water supply and water demand on the atmosphere\textendash land interface. Despite continuous improvements, coupled climate models still have significant systematic errors in simulating AI in terms of temporal and spatial variabilities. One of the approaches to bias-correct simulations is extracting the linear relationship between historical observations and model outputs by utilizing the empirical orthogonal function (EOF). In this study, the methodology of ensemble EOF-based bias-correction by observational constraints is developed based on previous bias-correction approach, with the improvement on seeking the optimal combinations of the leading modes with sensitivity test and replacing the certain correction with the ensemble means of optimal members. In verification, the ensemble mean of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5-EM) is bias-corrected towards the CPC/GLDAS observations, and the extracted leading modes present high correlations with internal climate variability. By cross-validation and posteriori independent validation of hindcasts over the historical period (1948\textendash 2005), the ensemble EOF-based bias-correction could better present spatial patterns compared to the CMIP5-EM after systematic bias-correction, as indicated by the anomaly correlation and the root mean square error. The verifications also indicate that the temporal variability in aridity over different dryland regions is much closer to that in the observations and that the dryland subtype changes are improved significantly by bias-corrections. Besides, another observational dataset of UDel/CRU is applied to assess the uncertainty on different datasets and the improvement on skill scores is robust. The above results verify that the ensemble EOF-based bias-corrections provide better reference for assessing and projecting global aridity changes by climate models.},

The Arctic amplification decreases the meridional temperature gradient, and simultaneously decreases static stability. These changes in the meridional temperature gradient and in the static stability have opposing effects on baroclinicity. The temperature increase at the upper tropospheric lower latitudes tends to increase the meridional temperature gradient and simultaneously increase static stability, which have opposing effects on baroclinicity as well. In this study, a dry idealized general circulation model with a modified Newtonian cooling scheme, which allows any chosen zonally symmetric temperature distribution to be simulated, is used to study the effect of Arctic amplification and lower-latitude upper-level warming on eddy activity. Due to the interplay between the static stability and meridional temperature gradient on atmospheric baroclinicity changes, and their opposing effect on atmospheric baroclinicity, it is found that both the Arctic amplification and lower-latitude upper-level warming could potentially lead to both decreases and increases in eddy activity, depending on the exact prescribed temperature modifications. Therefore, to understand the effect of global warming\textendash like temperature trends on eddy activity, the zonally symmetric global warming temperature projections from state-of-the-art models are simulated. It is found that the eddy kinetic energy changes are dominated by the lower-latitude upper-level warming, which tends to weaken the eddy kinetic energy due to increased static stability. On the other hand, the eddy heat flux changes are dominated by the Arctic amplification, which tends to weaken the eddy heat flux at the lower levels.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract The relation between the mean meridional temperature gradient and eddy fluxes has been addressed by several eddy flux closure theories. However, these theories give little information on the dependence of eddy fluxes on the vertical structure of the temperature gradient. The response of eddies to changes in the vertical structure of the temperature gradient is especially interesting since global circulation models suggest that as a result of greenhouse warming, the lower-tropospheric temperature gradient will decrease whereas the upper-tropospheric temperature gradient will increase. The effects of the vertical structure of baroclinicity on atmospheric circulation, particularly on the eddy activity, are investigated. An idealized global circulation model with a modified Newtonian relaxation scheme is used. The scheme allows the authors to obtain a heating profile that produces a predetermined mean temperature profile and to study the response of eddy activity to changes in the vertical structure of baroclinicity. The results indicate that eddy activity is more sensitive to temperature gradient changes in the upper troposphere. It is suggested that the larger eddy sensitivity to the upper-tropospheric temperature gradient is a consequence of large baroclinicity concentrated in upper levels. This result is consistent with a 1D Eady-like model with nonuniform shear showing more sensitivity to shear changes in regions of larger baroclinicity. In some cases, an increased temperature gradient at lower-tropospheric levels might decrease the eddy kinetic energy, and it is demonstrated that this might be related to the midwinter minimum in eddy kinetic energy observed above the northern Pacific.},

Uncertainties exist regarding the climatic response to strong volcanic forcing identified in coupled climate simulations that contributed to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In order to better understand the sources of these model diversities, the Model Intercomparison Project on the climatic response to Volcanic forcing (VolMIP) has defined a coordinated set of idealized volcanic perturbation experiments to be carried out in alignment with the CMIP6 protocol. VolMIP provides a common stratospheric aerosol data set for each experiment to minimize differences in the applied volcanic forcing. It defines a set of initial conditions to assess how internal climate variability contributes to determining the response. VolMIP will assess to what extent volcanically forced responses of the coupled ocean\textendash atmosphere system are robustly simulated by state-of-the-art coupled climate models and identify the causes that limit robust simulated behavior, especially differences in the treatment of physical processes. This paper illustrates the design of the idealized volcanic perturbation experiments in the VolMIP protocol and describes the common aerosol forcing input data sets to be used.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract This study explores the possible drivers of the recent Hadley circulation strengthening in the modern reanalyses. Predominantly, two recent generations of reanalyses provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are used: the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) and the interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim). Some results are also evaluated against other long-term reanalyses. To assess the origins of the Hadley cell (HC) strength variability we employ the Kuo-Eliassen (KE) equation. ERA5 shows that both HCs were strengthening prior to 2000s, but they have been weakening or remained steady afterwards. Most of the long-term variability in the strength of the HCs is explained by the meridional gradient of diabatic (latent) heating, which is related to precipitation gradients. However, the strengthening of both HCs in ERA5 is larger than the strengthening expected from the observed zonal-mean precipitation gradient (via Global Precipitation Climatology Project, GPCP). This suggests that the HC strength trends in the recent decades in ERA5 can be explained partly as an artifact of the misrepresentation of latent heating and partly through (physical) long-term variability. To show that the latter is true, we analyze ERA5 preliminary data for the 1950-1978 period, other long-term (e.g. 20th century) reanalyses, and sea surface temperature observational data. This reveals that the changes in the HC strength can be a consequence of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and related diabatic and frictional processes, which in turn drive the global HC variability. This work has implications for further understanding of the long-term variability of the Hadley circulation.},

Sea ice influence is estimated by comparing the circulation response in the RCP8.5 scenario against the circulation response to sea surface warming and CO2 increase inferred from the AMIPFuture and AMIP4xCO2 experiments, where sea ice is unperturbed. Multimodel evidence of the impact of sea ice loss on midlatitude atmospheric circulation is identified in late winter (January\textendash March), when the sea ice-related surface heat flux perturbation is largest. Sea ice loss acts to suppress the projected poleward shift of the North Atlantic jet, to increase surface pressure in northern Siberia, and to lower it in North America. These features are consistent with previous single-model studies, and the present results indicate that they are robust to model formulation.},

Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.},

It reveals that three net cloud feedback components are robustly nonzero: positive feedbacks from increasing free tropospheric cloud altitude and decreasing low cloud cover and a negative feedback from increasing low cloud optical depth. Low cloud amount feedback is the dominant contributor to spread in net cloud feedback but its anticorrelation with other components damps overall spread. The ensemble mean free tropospheric cloud altitude feedback is roughly 60\% as large as the standard cloud altitude feedback because it avoids aliasing in low cloud reductions.

  abstract = {Longwave cloud feedback is systematically positive and nearly the same magnitude across all global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Here it is shown that this robust positive longwave cloud feedback is caused in large part by the tendency for tropical high clouds to rise in such a way as to remain at nearly the same temperature as the climate warms. Furthermore, it is shown that such a cloud response to a warming climate is consistent with well-known physics, specifically the requirement that, in equilibrium, tropospheric heating by convection can only be large in the altitude range where radiative cooling is efficient, following the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis of Hartmann and Larson (2002). Longwave cloud feedback computed assuming that high-cloud temperature follows upper tropospheric convergence-weighted temperature, which we refer to as proportionately higher anvil temperature, gives an excellent prediction of the longwave cloud feedback in the AR4 models. The ensemble-mean feedback of 0.5 W m-2 K-1 is much larger than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed pressure, highlighting the large contribution from rising cloud tops to the robustly positive feedback. An important result of this study is that the convergence profile computed from clear-sky energy and mass balance warms slightly as the climate warms, in proportion to the increase in stability, which results in a longwave cloud feedback that is slightly smaller than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed temperature.},

Here, an idealized model of a dry, three-dimensional atmosphere is used to compare the response to zonally symmetric and asymmetric off-equatorial thermal forcings. For symmetric forcings, the zonal-mean, cross-equatorial mass flux increases more rapidly with the amplitude of the forcing once the forcing becomes strong enough to reduce the upper-tropospheric absolute vorticity to near zero, consistent with previous studies of the transition to angular momentum\textendash conserving flow. For zonally asymmetric forcings, the zonal-mean cross-equatorial flow exhibits a similar dependence on forcing strength and a similar reduction of the zonal-mean upper-level vorticity, but asymmetric forcings also produce strong zonal overturnings with subsidence west of the heating, as in the well-known linear response to off-equatorial heatings. The mass flux in these zonal overturnings increases linearly with forcing strength until its rate of increase tapers off for the strongest forcings; the total upward mass flux (i.e., the zonal-mean plus zonally asymmetric components) increases linearly with the strength of zonally asymmetric forcings and exhibits no abrupt or nonlinear dependence on forcing amplitude. These results indicate the importance of considering the zonally asymmetric part of the divergent response to off-equatorial forcings and suggest that theories based on zonally symmetric forcings need further examination before they can be assumed to describe observed monsoons.},

The SO ensemble produces a more realistic tropical South Atlantic SST trend, and exhibits a higher pattern correlation with observed SST trends in the greater Atlantic basin, compared to the control ensemble.

  abstract = {The uncertainty in polar cloud feedbacks calls for process understanding of the cloud response to climate warming. As an initial step toward improved process understanding, we investigate the seasonal cycle of polar clouds in the current climate by adopting a novel modeling framework using large eddy simulations (LES), which explicitly resolve cloud dynamics. Resolved horizontal and vertical advection of heat and moisture from an idealized general circulation model (GCM) are prescribed as forcing in the LES. The LES are also forced with prescribed sea ice thickness, but surface temperature, atmospheric temperature, and moisture evolve freely without nudging. A semigray radiative transfer scheme without water vapor and cloud feedbacks allows the GCM and LES to achieve closed energy budgets more easily than would be possible with more complex schemes. This enables the mean states in the two models to be consistently compared, without the added complications from interaction with more comprehensive radiation. We show that the LES closely follow the GCM seasonal cycle, and the seasonal cycle of low-level clouds in the LES resembles observations: maximum cloud liquid occurs in late summer and early autumn, and winter clouds are dominated by ice in the upper troposphere. Large-scale advection of moisture provides the main source of water vapor for the liquid-containing clouds in summer, while a temperature advection peak in winter makes the atmosphere relatively dry and reduces cloud condensate. The framework we develop and employ can be used broadly for studying cloud processes and the response of polar clouds to climate warming.},

  abstract = {Abstract Baroclinic eddy equilibration and the roles of different boundary layer processes in limiting the baroclinic adjustment are studied using an atmosphere\textendash ocean thermally coupled model. Boundary layer processes not only affect the dynamical constraint of the midlatitude baroclinic eddy equilibration but also are important components in the underlying surface energy budget. The authors' study shows that baroclinic eddies, with the strong mixing of the surface air temperature, compete against the fast boundary layer thermal damping and enhance the meridional variation of surface sensible heat flux, acting to reduce the meridional gradient of the surface temperature. Nevertheless, the requirement of the surface energy balance indicates that strong surface baroclinicity is always maintained in response to the meridionally varying solar radiation. With the strong surface baroclinicity and the boundary layer processes, the homogenized potential vorticity (PV) suggested in the baroclinic adjustment are never observed near the surface or in the boundary layer. Although different boundary layer processes affect baroclinic eddy equilibration differently with more dynamical feedbacks and time scales included in the coupled system, their influence in limiting the PV homogenization is more uniform compared with the previous uncoupled runs. The boundary layer PV structure is more determined by the strength of the boundary layer damping than the surface baroclinicity. Stronger boundary layer processes always prevent the lower-level PV homogenization more efficiently. Above the boundary layer, a relatively robust PV structure with homogenized PV around 600\textendash 800 hPa is obtained in all of the simulations. The detailed mechanisms through which different boundary layer processes affect the equilibration of the coupled system are discussed in this study.},

It is found that surface-based inversion (SBI) at two coastal stations exists throughout the whole year, mainly due to the surface cooling in cold months, advection warm months, and the orography of the stations. The seasonal variation of surfaced-based HI (SBHI) frequency is similar to that of SBI, and its intensity is greater in summer because of the larger air moisture content. The frequency of the first elevated TI (EI1) and HI (EHI1) are both higher than that of the surface-based ones. The second elevated TI/HI layer (EI2/EHI2) is shallower and weaker than that of the EI1/EHI1. At two coastal stations, EI1 caused by warm advection is thicker and stronger than that caused by subsidence. At the station farther from the coast, EI1 caused by subsidence is higher, thinner, and stronger. The top height and depth of the EHI2 both show seasonal variations, with larger values in the cold months. EHI1 tends to be formed by the TI, whereas EHI2 is dominant by humidity advection at all studied stations. HI under the influence of TI is usually thicker and stronger than that formed by humidity advection. The coexistence of EI and EHI is the most frequent inversion structure at these stations.},

  abstract = {The quasi-equilibrium assumption proposed by Arakawa and Schubert assumes that convection is controlled by the large-scale forcing in a statistical sense, in such a way that the stabilization of the atmosphere by convection is in quasi-equilibrium with the destabilization by the large-scale forcing. The assumption was developed largely based on observations in the tropical maritime environment and has not been evaluated in midlatitudes. This study examines the quasi-equilibrium assumption in midlatitude continental convection environment using summertime observations from the Southern Great Plains of the United States. Two complementary approaches are taken for this purpose. The first one compares the net time rate of change of convective available potential energy to that due to the large-scale forcing. The second one examines the contributions to the net change of CAPE from the boundary layer air and the free tropospheric air above. Results from both the approaches indicate that the quasi-equilibrium assumption is not well suited for midlatitude continental convection. It is shown that the net change of CAPE is comparable to and largely comes from that due to thermodynamic changes of the boundary layer air, while the contribution from the free troposphere above the boundary layer is negligible. The analysis also shows that the role of convective inhibition to suppress convection is the most pronounced when the large-scale forcing in the free troposphere is weak. On the basis of these and other observations, a modification to the quasi-equilibrium assumption is proposed. It assumes that convective and large-scale processes in the free troposphere above the boundary layer are in balance, so that contribution from the free troposphere to changes in CAPE is negligible. This assumption is then tested using the single column model of the NCAR CCM3 by modifying the closure in the CCM3 convection scheme. Such a modification significantly improves the single column model simulation. The applicability of this new quasi-equilibrium assumption to tropical convection environment is also discussed.},

Results are compared with those in midlatitudes using data from the southern Great Plains in the United States. It is shown that precipitation is highly correlated to the free tropospheric large-scale forcing in both the tropics and midlatitudes. In the tropics, but not in the midlatitudes, precipitation is also highly correlated to the total large-scale forcing that includes surface fluxes. This is because the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes are small over the tropical ocean; thus their contribution to the total large-scale forcing is relatively small compared to the free tropospheric forcing. The opposite is true for midlatitude continental convection. It is also shown that the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium between convection and large-scale forcing recently proposed by the author for midlatitude continental convection is equally accurate for tropical oceanic convection. The quasi-equilibrium proposed by Arakawa and Schubert is less accurate in depicting convective stabilization for data averaged from 3 to 24 hours. On timescales longer than 24 hours the two are comparable. Comparisons are made with other studies that use the Arakawa-Schubert quasi-equilibrium concept, and seemingly contradictory results are reconciled.},

To facilitate comparison between different stages of cumulus convection, the data are divided into four categories: environment, presystem, insystem, and postsystem. It is found that the convective available potential energy of the atmosphere is reduced substantially after cumulus convection, most of which is consumed during the transition from presystem to insystem. Examination of the temperature and moisture changes during cumulus convection suggests that cooling and drying in the subcloud layer are the most important factors in stabilizing the atmosphere. In general, virtual potential temperature profiles in all categories are close to reversible moist adiabats below the 600-mb level and nearly parallel to moist pseudoadiabats above it. The effect of entrainment on parcel buoyancy is also studied. It is found that a small amount of entrainment of ambient air can lead to a pronounced decrease of parcel buoyancy. Furthermore, for diluted parcel ascent, the convective available potential energy is greater for the insystem category than for the postsystem one, whereas the opposite is true for undiluted parcel ascent.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Indian Ocean has an intriguing Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) south of the equator year-round, which remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate this Indian Ocean ITCZ and the mechanisms for its origin. With a weak semiannual cycle, this ITCZ peaks in January-February with strongest rainfall, southernmost location and a northeast-southwest orientation from the maritime continent to Madagascar, reaches a minimum around May with a zonal orientation, grows until its secondary maximum around September with a northwest-southeast orientation, weakens slightly until December and then regains its mature phase in January. During austral summer, the Indian Ocean ITCZ exists over maximum surface moist static energy (MSE), consistent with convective quasi-equilibrium theory. This relationship breaks up during boreal summer when the surface MSE maximizes in the northern monsoon region. The position and orientation of the Indian Ocean ITCZ can be simulated well in both a linear dynamical model and the state-of-the-art Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) when driven by observed sea surface temperature (SST). To quantify the contributions of planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free atmosphere processes to this ITCZ, we homogenize the free atmosphere diabatic heating over the Indian Ocean in CAM6. In response, the ITCZ weakens significantly, owing to a weakened circulation and deep convection. Therefore, in CAM6, the SST drives the Indian Ocean ITCZ directly through PBL processes and indirectly via free atmosphere diabatic heating. Their contributions are comparable during most seasons, except during the austral summer when the free atmosphere diabatic heating dominates the mature-phase ITCZ.},

Furthermore, the distribution of rainfall amount in subcloud MSE is very similar over land and ocean with the peak at 343 J/g and a half width at half maximum of 3 J/g.

This linearity manifests in global climate models, which robustly produce a global-mean longwave clear-sky (LWCS) feedback of 1.9 W/m2/K, consistent with idealized single-column models (Koll \& Cronin, 2018, https//:doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1809868115). However, there is considerable spatial variability in the LWCS feedback, including negative values over tropical oceans (known as the ``super-greenhouse effect'') which are compensated for by larger values in the subtropics/extratropics. Therefore, it is unclear how the idealized single-column results are relevant for the global-mean LWCS feedback in comprehensive climate models. Here we show with a simple analytical theory and model output that the compensation of this spatial variability to produce a robust global-mean feedback can be explained by two facts: (1) When conditioned upon free-tropospheric column relative humidity (RH), the LWCS feedback is independent of RH, and (2) the global histogram of free-tropospheric column RH is largely invariant under warming.},

Therefore, the present-day wet regions will become more competitive for convection in a warmer world.

However, model projections of extreme temperatures, a widely used metric for extreme heat, are uncertain on regional scales. In addition, humidity needs to be taken into account to estimate the health impact of extreme heat. Here we show that an integrated temperature\textendash humidity metric for the health impact of heat, namely, the extreme wet-bulb temperature (TW), is controlled by established atmospheric dynamics and thus can be robustly projected on regional scales. For each 1\,\textdegree C of tropical mean warming, global climate models project extreme TW (the annual maximum of daily mean or 3-hourly values) to increase roughly uniformly between 20\textdegree\,S and 20\textdegree\,N latitude by about 1\,\textdegree C. This projection is consistent with theoretical expectation based on tropical atmospheric dynamics, and observations over the past 40 years, which gives confidence to the model projection. For a 1.5\,\textdegree C warmer world, the probable (66\% confidence interval) increase of regional extreme TW is projected to be 1.33\textendash 1.49\,\textdegree C, whereas the uncertainty of projected extreme temperatures is 3.7 times as large. These results suggest that limiting global warming to 1.5\,\textdegree C will prevent most of the tropics from reaching a TW of 35\,\textdegree C, the limit of human adaptation.},

  abstract = {Abstract Moored buoy data from the equatorial Pacific are analyzed to investigate the relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and latent heat flux from the ocean. It is found that at low SST the latent heat flux increases with SST; at high SST the latent heat flux decreases with increasing SST, a relationship that cannot be explained by thermodynamic considerations alone. Analysis of the wind speeds and humidity differences between the surface air and the saturation humidity at the sea surface temperature indicates that while at low SST the humidity difference primarily determines the latent heat flux, and at high SST a sharp decrease in wind speed is mostly responsible for the low latent heat flux. A mechanism that leads to low latent heat flux at high SST is suggested; it involves the interaction between convection and the large-scale circulation. The longitudinal distribution of SST, wind speed, humidity difference, and latent heat flux is found to be similar to that in previous studies. In the eastern Pacific, SST is the lowest, the wind speed is large, and the humidity difference is low; in the western Pacific, SST is the highest, whereas the wind speed is low and the humidity difference is large. Latent heat flux increases from the eastern Pacific westward, reaching a maximum in the central Pacific, and then decreases toward the western Pacific warm pool. Through analyses of the data on different timescales, we found that the atmospheric processes leading to low latent heat flux over warm SST were mainly operative on seasonal timescales (periods longer than 90 days). On shorter timescales (periods of 30\textendash 90 days), the influence of intraseasonal Madden and Julian waves was evident. On this timescale, the relationship between SST and latent heat flux was characterized by a 10-day lag between atmospheric forcing (primarily related to winds) and the local oceanic response in the western and central Pacific. In the eastern Pacific cold tongue, SST and latent heat flux variations were nearly in phase on this timescale, indicating an atmospheric response to oceanic forcing. For periods less than 30 days, SST variations associated with tropical instability waves were likewise shown to be important in forcing latent heat flux variations in the eastern Pacific cold tongue.},

While it is known that ocean dynamics plays an essential role in EPDV, the simulations by air-sea thermodynamically coupled slab ocean models (SOM) obscure the nature of the role of ocean dynamics. To confront this issue, we use a mechanically decoupled simulation, which isolates the effects of thermodynamic coupling processes and mean ocean circulation on EPDV. Thus, by comparing the simulation to a SOM, we investigate the role of mean ocean circulation and show that it plays a role in damping EPDV, primarily through mean equatorial Pacific upwelling. By comparing the simulation to a fully coupled dynamic ocean model (DOM), we examine the role of anomalous wind-driven ocean circulation and demonstrate that it plays a role in amplifying EPDV. Further, this amplification strength overwhelms the upwelling damping effect, resulting in the anomalous wind-driven ocean circulation forcing EPDV. Finally, we examine the origin of EPDV in the DOM and show that it originates from a zonal dipole mode in the tropical Pacific, which is strongly associated with decadal modulation of ENSO amplitude. Taking EPDV as an example, our study advances the understanding of the two distinct dynamical systems (SOM and DOM), benefiting the physical interpretation of other climate variabilities.},

  abstract = {The Sahel summer rainfall is of great significance to the local social, economic, and cultural environment. In the context of a long Sahel megadrought in the last thirty years of the twentieth century, the future change of Sahel summer rainfall under global warming has aroused wide attention. Based on the historical simulations and high emission scenario experiments from 20 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase-5 (CMIP5) models and 22 CMIP6 models, this study investigates the future projections of Sahel summer rainfall under global warming. The results show that the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean projects a slight increase (1\textendash 2\%/\textcelsius ) of summer rainfall over the Sahel in the future which seems to be due to the thermodynamic changes and opposed by the dynamic changes, but that the inter-model spread is due to the latter. We find that, in particular, the inter-model spreads in the extratropical northern and tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) changes are two important sources of the uncertainty in the Sahel summer rainfall projections via two different atmospheric teleconnection processes. On the one hand, a warmer northern Atlantic SST would induce an anomalous large-scale cyclone over North Africa and Europe, and the southern branch would strengthen the western African monsoonal circulation, leading to a wetter Sahel. On the other hand, a warmer tropical Atlantic SST would weaken the regional circulation, resulting in a drier Sahel. Our results suggest that an improved projection of the future Atlantic warming, especially the differential warming between the northern and tropical Atlantic, is a priority for the reliable future projection of Sahel summer rainfall.},

  abstract = {Arctic sea ice has significant seasonal variability. Prior to the 2000s, it retreated about 15\% in summer and fully recovered in winter. However, by the year 2007, Arctic sea ice extent experienced a catastrophic decline to about 4.28\texttimes 106 km2, which was 50\% lower than conditions in the 1950s to the 1970s (Serreze et al., 2008). That was a record low over the course of the modern satellite record, since 1979 (note that the year 2012 became the new record low). This astonishing event drew wide-ranging attention in 2007-2009 during the 4th International Polar Year. The dramatic decline of sea ice attracts many scientists' interest and has become the focus of intense research since then. Currently, sea ice retreat is not only appearing around the marginal ice zone, but also in the pack ice inside the central Arctic (Zhao et al., 2018). In fact, premonitory signs had already been seen through other evidence. Before the disintegration of the Soviet Union, US naval submarines had been conducting an extensive survey under the sea ice and taking measurements of sea ice thickness. Their measurements revealed a gradual decrease of ice thickness to 1.8 m during winter by the end of the 20th century, in contrast to the climatological mean of 3.1m (Rothrock et al., 1999). However, this alarming result did not draw much attention since the Arctic was still severely cold at that time.},

Drought-driven increases in ET (\$\$\{\textbackslash rm\{ET\}\}\_\{\{\textbackslash rm\{drought\}\}\}\^ +\$\$) are of particular concern because they quickly deplete water resources, causing flash droughts and acute stress on ecosystems.

A bulk diagnostic approach is constructed, and a set of variables is derived and demonstrated to be useful in understanding the simulated relationship. In particular, a novel bulk quantity, the convective precipitation efficiency or equivalently the convective detrainment efficiency, is proposed as a simple measure of the aggregated properties of parameterized convection important to the GCM simulated clouds. As the convective precipitation efficiency increases in the perturbed-physics experiments, both liquid and ice water path decrease, with low and middle cloud fractions diminishing at a faster rate than high cloud fractions. This asymmetry results in a large sensitivity of top-of-atmosphere net cloud radiative forcing to changes in convective precipitation efficiency in this limited set of models.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}For global warming experiments, intermodel variations in the response of cloud condensate, low cloud fraction, and total cloud radiative forcing are well explained by model variations in response to total precipitation (or detrainment) efficiency. Despite significant variability, all of the perturbed-physics models produce a sizable increase in precipitation efficiency to warming. A substantial fraction of the increase is due to its convective component, which depends on the parameterization of cumulus mixing and convective microphysical processes. The increase in convective precipitation efficiency and associated change in convective cloud height distribution owing to warming explains the increased cloud feedback and climate sensitivity in recently developed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCMs. The results imply that a cumulus scheme using fractional removal of condensate for precipitation and inverse calculation of the entrainment rate tends to produce a lower climate sensitivity than a scheme using threshold removal for precipitation and the entrainment rate formulated inversely dependent on convective depth.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

In this study, we seek a basic understanding of the dependence of cloud feedback on the spatial pattern of warming. Idealized experiments are carried out with an AGCM to calculate the change in global mean cloud-induced radiation anomalies ({$\Delta$}Rcloud) in response to imposed surface warming/cooling in 74 individual localized oceanic ``patches''. Then the cloud feedback in response to a specific warming pattern can be approximated as the superposition of global cloud feedback in response to a temperature change in each region, weighted by the magnitude of the local temperature changes. When there is a warming in the tropical subsidence or extratropical regions, the local decrease of LCC results in a positive change in Rcloud. Conversely, warming in tropical ascent regions increases the free-tropospheric temperature throughout the tropics, thereby enhancing the inversion strength over remote regions and inducing positive global low-cloud cover (LCC) anomalies and negative Rcloud anomalies. The Green's function approach performs reasonably well in predicting the response of global mean {$\Delta$}LCC and net {$\Delta$}Rcloud, but poorly for shortwave and longwave components of {$\Delta$}Rcloud due to its ineffectiveness in predicting middle and high cloud cover changes. The approach successfully captures the change of cloud feedback in response to time-evolving CO2-induced warming and captures the interannual variations in {$\Delta$}Rcloud observed by CERES. The results highlight important nonlocal influences of SST changes on cloud feedback.},

The negative temperature deviation from the moist adiabat manifests a C-shape profile and is projected to increase and stretch upward under warming in both comprehensive climate models and idealized radiative\textendash convective equilibrium (RCE) simulations. The increased temperature deviation corresponds to a larger convective available potential energy (CAPE) under warming. The extreme convective updraft velocity in RCE increases correspondingly but at a smaller fractional rate than that of CAPE. A conceptual model for the tropical temperature deviation and convective updraft velocities is formulated to understand these features. The model builds on the previous zero-buoyancy model but replaces the bulk zero-buoyancy plume by a spectrum of entraining plumes that have distinct entrainment rates and are positively buoyant until their levels of neutral buoyancy. Besides the negative temperature deviation and its increasing magnitude with warming, this allows the spectral plume model to further predict the C-shape profile as well as its upward stretch with warming. By representing extreme convective updrafts as weakly entraining plumes, the model is able to reproduce the smaller fractional increase in convective velocities with warming as compared to that of CAPE. The smaller fractional increase is mainly caused by the upward stretch in the temperature deviation profile with warming, which reduces the ratio between the integrated plume buoyancy and CAPE. The model thus provides a useful tool for understanding the tropical temperature profile and convective updraft velocities.},

The focus of GMMIP is on monsoon climatology, variability, prediction and projection, which is relevant to four of the ``Grand Challenges'' proposed by the World Climate Research Programme. At present, 21 international modeling groups are committed to joining GMMIP. This overview paper introduces the motivation behind GMMIP and the scientific questions it intends to answer. Three tiers of experiments, of decreasing priority, are designed to examine (a) model skill in simulating the climatology and interannual-to-multidecadal variability of global monsoons forced by the sea surface temperature during historical climate period; (b) the roles of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in driving variations of the global and regional monsoons; and (c) the effects of large orographic terrain on the establishment of the monsoons. The outputs of the CMIP6 Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments (DECK), ``historical'' simulation and endorsed MIPs will also be used in the diagnostic analysis of GMMIP to give a comprehensive understanding of the roles played by different external forcings, potential improvements in the simulation of monsoon rainfall at high resolution and reproducibility at decadal timescales. The implementation of GMMIP will improve our understanding of the fundamental physics of changes in the global and regional monsoons over the past 140 years and ultimately benefit monsoons prediction and projection in the current century.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The iCESM suggests that total variance of the IFA records may only reflect changes in the annual cycle instead of ENSO variability as previously assumed.

This is done in two different ways, changing either the radiative equilibrium baroclinicity or the diabatic time scale for the zonal-mean flow. When the radiative equilibrium baroclinicity is changed, the isentropic slope remains insensitive against changes in the forcing, in agreement with previous results. However, the isentropic slope steepens when the diabatic heating rate is accelerated for the zonal-mean flow. Changes in the ratio between the interior and the boundary diffusivities as the diabatic heating rate is varied appear to be responsible for the violation of the constant criticality constraint in this model. Theoretical arguments are used to relate the sensitivity of the isentropic slope to that of the isentropic mass flux, which also remains constant when the radiative-equilibrium baroclinicity is changed. The sensitivity of the isentropic mass flux on the heating depends on how the gross stability changes. Bulk stabilities calculated from isobaric averages and gross stabilities estimated from isentropic diagnostics are not necessarily equivalent because a significant part of the return flow occurs at potential temperatures colder than the mean surface temperature.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

  abstract = {Daily maps of multiyear ice concentration, derived from Nimbus-7 SMMR passive microwave data, are analyzed to obtain the displacement of the multiyear ice edge and information on the convergence/divergence within the pack. The dynamic\textemdash thermodynamic sea-ice model of Hibler (1979) is run with daily time steps and with forcing by the interannually varying fields of geostrophic wind and temperature-derived thermodynamic fluxes. Model-data comparisons are made for the net drift during the months of November through January of the 1978\textemdash 79, 1979\textemdash 80, and 1980\textemdash 81 seasons, and for the shorter-term drift during a 52 day period. Both the model and the data-based drifts for the 25 November 1978 to 28 January 1979 period differ from the classical Beaufort-gyre pattern exhibited in the other two winters. For the 52 day period of November\textemdash December 1978, both the model and the data show an eastward drift followed by a westward drift of the ice edges in the Laptev Sea, and for the 25 November 1978 to 28 January 1979 period, a net westward drift of about 250 km. Overall, the model and the data exhibit the same patterns of ice movement with marked month-to-month and large interannual variations in the drift. Good agreement is found in most regions of the central Arctic, but pronounced discrepancies occur near the edge of the total ice pack in the East Greenland Sea. During a short period of large changes in multiyear ice concentration in the central Arctic around 2 December 1980, the divergence implied by the changes in multiyear concentration is qualitatively compared with the divergence computed from the modeled velocity fields. Both the microwave data and the model results indicate similar temporal characteristics of pack-ice response during this major deformation event.},
