    abstractNote={The quasi-equilibrium assumption proposed by Arakawa and Schubert assumes that convection is controlled by the large-scale forcing in a statistical sense, in such a way that the stabilization of the atmosphere by convection is in quasi-equilibrium with the destabilization by the large-scale forcing. The assumption was developed largely based on observations in the tropical maritime environment and has not been evaluated in midlatitudes. This study examines the quasi-equilibrium assumption in midlatitude continental convection environment using summertime observations from the Southern Great Plains of the United States. Two complementary approaches are taken for this purpose. The first one compares the net time rate of change of convective available potential energy to that due to the large-scale forcing. The second one examines the contributions to the net change of CAPE from the boundary layer air and the free tropospheric air above. Results from both the approaches indicate that the quasi-equilibrium assumption is not well suited for midlatitude continental convection. It is shown that the net change of CAPE is comparable to and largely comes from that due to thermodynamic changes of the boundary layer air, while the contribution from the free troposphere above the boundary layer is negligible. The analysis also shows that the role of convective inhibition to suppress convection is the most pronounced when the large-scale forcing in the free troposphere is weak. On the basis of these and other observations, a modification to the quasi-equilibrium assumption is proposed. It assumes that convective and large-scale processes in the free troposphere above the boundary layer are in balance, so that contribution from the free troposphere to changes in CAPE is negligible. This assumption is then tested using the single column model of the NCAR CCM3 by modifying the closure in the CCM3 convection scheme. Such a modification significantly improves the single column model simulation. The applicability of this new quasi-equilibrium assumption to tropical convection environment is also discussed.},

    abstractNote={This study reports the Single-Column Model (SCM) part of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)/the Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Cloud System Study (GCSS) joint SCM and Cloud-Resolving Model (CRM) Case 3 intercomparison study, with a focus on evaluation of cumulus parametrizations used in SCMs. Fifteen SCMs are evaluated under summertime midlatitude continental conditions using data collected at the ARM Southern Great Plains site during the summer 1997 Intensive Observing Period. Results from ten CRMs are also used to diagnose problems in the SCMs. It is shown that most SCMs can generally capture well the convective events that were well-developed within the SCM domain, while most of them have difficulties in simulating the occurrence of those convective events that only occurred within a small part of the domain. All models significantly underestimate the surface stratiform precipitation. A third of them produce large errors in surface precipitation and thermodynamic structures. Deficiencies in convective triggering mechanisms are thought to be one of the major reasons. Using a triggering mechanism that is based on the vertical integral of parcel buoyant energy without additional appropriate constraints results in overactive convection, which in turn leads to large systematic warm/dry biases in the troposphere. It is also shown that a non-penetrative convection scheme can underestimate the depth of instability for midlatitude convection, which leads to large systematic cold/moist biases in the troposphere. SCMs agree well quantitatively with CRMs in the updraught mass fluxes, while most models significantly underestimate the downdraught mass fluxes. Neglect of mesoscale updraught and downdraught mass fluxes in the SCMs contributes considerably to the discrepancies between the SCMs and the CRMs. In addition, uncertainties in the diagnosed mass fluxes in the CRMs and deficiencies with cumulus parametrizations are not negligible. Similar results are obtained in the sensitivity tests when different forcing approaches are used. Finally, sensitivity tests from an SCM indicate that its simulations can be greatly improved when its triggering mechanism and closure assumption are improved. © Royal Meteorological Society, 2002.

    abstractNote={The rate of increase of extreme precipitation in response to global warming varies dramatically across climate model simulations, particularly over the tropics, for reasons that have yet to be established. Here we propose one potential mechanism: changing organization of convection with climate. We analyze a set of simulations with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 with an idealized global radiative-convective equilibrium configuration forced by fixed sea surface temperatures varying in 2° increments from 285 to 307 K. In these simulations, convective organization varies from semiorganized in cold simulations, disorganized in warm simulations, and abruptly becomes highly organized at just over 300 K. The change in extreme precipitation with warming also varies across these simulations, including a large increase at the transition from disorganized to organized convection. We develop an extreme precipitation-focused metric for convective organization and use this to explore their connection.},

    DOI={10.1175/2010JAS3542.1},
    abstractNote={Abstract Using high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations with different CO2 concentrations, local precipitation fluxes are found to obey Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) scaling. Previous studies of the effect of CO2 concentration on precipitation extremes have used general circulation models, which are poor platforms for studying tropical convection because convection is parameterized. In idealized cloud-resolving simulations, it is possible to identify not only the changes in local precipitation fluxes, but also the factors responsible for those changes. There are many properties of convection that can change as the atmosphere warms, each of which could produce deviations from CC scaling. These properties include the effective water-vapor gradient, cloud pressure depth, and cloud velocity. A simple theory is developed that predicts the changes in these properties consistent with CC scaling. Convection in the cloud-resolving simulations is found to change as predicted by this theory, leading to an ∼20% increase in local precipitation fluxes when the CO2 concentration is doubled. Overall, an increase in CO2 leads to more vigorous convection, composed of clouds that are wider, taller, and faster.},

This has been done in general terms through consideration of the tropical beat budget and in specific terms through consideration of an idealized radiative-dynamic model of the tropical general circulation. It is argued that evaporation on its own cannot provide an effective regulating mechanism. Clouds cannot serve as regulators unless there are substantial departures from the observed cancellation between cloud greenhouse and cloud albedo effects. In particular, it is shown that the prediction by Ramanathan and Collins of highly stable tropical climates is based on an inconsistent set of assumptions about the behavior of the atmospheric heat transports. When the heat transports are treated in a consistent manner, clouds are found to have little impact, and the tropical climate can he quite sensitive to radiative perturbations.</p><p>It is found that the main determinant of tropical climate is the clear-sky water vapor greenhouse effect averaged over the entire Tropics. In the absence of dry “radiator fins” maintained by subsidence, the tropical temperature would tend to fall into a runaway greenhouse state that could be stabilized only by heat export to the extratropics. Some speculative results on sensitivity of the climate to perturbations are presented. Determination of the relative area of dry and subsiding versus moist and convecting regions of the Tropics, and of the degree of dryness of the subsiding regions, are identified as key unsolved problems concerning the tropical climate.</p></section},

    abstractNote={This study examines the nature of convective quasi-equilibrium in the tropical western Pacific using the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere/Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) sounding data. Results are compared with those in midlatitudes using data from the southern Great Plains in the United States. It is shown that precipitation is highly correlated to the free tropospheric large-scale forcing in both the tropics and midlatitudes. In the tropics, but not in the midlatitudes, precipitation is also highly correlated to the total large-scale forcing that includes surface fluxes. This is because the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes are small over the tropical ocean; thus their contribution to the total large-scale forcing is relatively small compared to the free tropospheric forcing. The opposite is true for midlatitude continental convection. It is also shown that the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium between convection and large-scale forcing recently proposed by the author for midlatitude continental convection is equally accurate for tropical oceanic convection. The quasi-equilibrium proposed by Arakawa and Schubert is less accurate in depicting convective stabilization for data averaged from 3 to 24 hours. On timescales longer than 24 hours the two are comparable. Comparisons are made with other studies that use the Arakawa-Schubert quasi-equilibrium concept, and seemingly contradictory results are reconciled.},

    abstractNote={The role of temperature feedbacks in polar amplification of climate change is examined by comparing the response of idealized high- and low-latitude atmospheric columns to greenhouse gas forcing. An analytic expression for the surface polar amplification factor is derived with a one-layer atmospheric model and compared to a more detailed column model with two radiative transfer schemes. The modeled temperature profiles result from competition between the stabilizing influences of atmospheric heat flux convergence and atmospheric solar heating (dominant at high latitudes), and the destabilizing influence of surface solar heating (dominant at low latitudes). For a stable high-latitude radiative-advective atmosphere, the lapse rate increases with greenhouse gas forcing, leading to a positive feedback, and is dependent on the nature of the forcing—pointing to limitations of the traditional forcing-feedback framework. For a low-latitude radiative-convective atmosphere, the lapse rate decreases, leading to a negative feedback.},

    abstractNote={<section class="abstract"><h2 class="abstractTitle text-title my-1" id="d173e2">Abstract</h2><p>It is widely believed that tropical cyclones are an intrinsically moist phenomenon, requiring evaporation and latent heat release in cumulus convection. Recent numerical modeling by Mrowiec et al., however, challenged this conventional wisdom by finding the formation of axisymmetric dry tropical cyclones in dry radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE). This paper addresses ensuing questions about the stability of dry tropical cyclones in 3D, the moist–dry vortex transition, and whether existing theories for intensity, size, and structure apply to dry cyclones. A convection-permitting model is used to simulate rotating 3D RCE, with surface wetness (0–1) and surface temperature (240–300 K) smoothly varying between dry and moist states. Tropical cyclones spontaneously form and persist for tens of days in both moist and dry/cold states, as well as part of the relatively moist/warm intermediate parameter space. As the surface is dried or cooled, cyclones weaken, both in absolute terms and relative to their potential intensities. Dry and semidry cyclones have smaller outer radii but similar-sized or larger convective centers compared to moist cyclones, consistent with existing structural theory. Strikingly, spontaneous cyclogenesis fails to occur at moderately low surface wetness values and intermediate surface temperatures of 250–270 K. Simulations with time-varying surface moisture and sea surface temperatures indicate this range of parameter space is a barrier to spontaneous genesis but not cyclone existence. Dry and semidry tropical cyclones in rotating RCE provide a compelling model system to further our understanding of real moist tropical cyclones.</p></section},

    abstractNote={Earth’s modern climate is characterized by wet, rainy deep tropics, however, paleoclimate and planetary science have revealed a wide range of hydrological cycle regimes connected to different external parameters. Here we investigate how surface wetness affects the tropical hydrological cycle. When surface wetness is decreased in an Earth-like general circulation model, the tropics remain wet but the transition from a rainy to a rain-free regime. The rain-free regime occurs when surface precipitation is suppressed as negative evaporation (surface condensation) balances moisture flux convergence. The regime transition is dominated by near-surface relative humidity changes in contrast to the hypothesis that relative humidity changes are small. We show near-surface relative humidity changes responsible for the regime transition are controlled by re-evaporation of stratiform precipitation near the lifting condensation level. Re-evaporation impacts the near-surface through vertical mixing. Our results reveal a new rain-free tropical hydrological cycle regime that goes beyond the wet/dry paradigm.},
